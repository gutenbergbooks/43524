<h2>AN IMAGINARY CONTRADICTION.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h2>


<p>We notice in this review the article
on the <i>Spirit of Romanism</i> for a
single point only, which it makes,
for as a whole it is not worth considering.
Father Hecker asserts in his
<i>Aspirations of Nature</i>, that, "Endowed
with reason, man has no right to
surrender his judgment; endowed with
free-will, man has no right to yield
up his liberty. Reason and free-will
constitute man a responsible being,
and he has no right to abdicate his
independence." To this and several
other extracts from the same work
to the same effect, the <cite>Christian
Quarterly</cite> opposes what is conceded
by Father Hecker and held by every
Catholic, that every one is bound
to believe whatever the church believes
and teaches. But bound as a
Catholic to submit his reason and
will to the authority of the church,
how can one assert that he is free to
exercise his own reason, and has no
right to surrender it, or to abdicate
his own independence? Father
Hecker says, "Religion is a question
between the soul and God; no human
authority has, therefore, any
right to enter its sacred sphere."
Yet he maintains that he is bound
to obey the authority of the church,
and has no right to believe or think
contrary to her teachings and definitions.
How can he maintain both
propositions?</p>

<p>What Father Hecker asserts is
that man has reason and free-will,
and that he has no right to forego
the exercise of these faculties, or to
surrender them to any human authority
whatever. Between this proposition
and that of the plenary authority
of the church in all matters of
faith or pertaining to faith and sound
doctrine, as asserted by the Council
of Trent and Pius IX. in the <cite>Syllabus</cite>,
the <cite>Christian Quarterly</cite> thinks it sees
a glaring contradiction. Father
Hecker, it is to be presumed, sees
none, and we certainly see none.
Father Hecker maintains that no <em>human</em>
authority has any right to enter
the sacred sphere of religion, that man
is accountable to no man or body
of men for his religion or his faith;
but he does not say that he is not
responsible to God for the use he
makes of his faculties, whether of reason
or free-will, or that God has no
right to enter the sacred sphere of religion,
and tell him even authoritatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
what is truth and what he is bound to
believe and do. When I believe and
obey a human authority in matters
of religion, I abdicate my own reason;
but when I believe and obey God, I
preserve it, follow it, do precisely
what reason itself tells me I ought to
do. There is no contradiction, then,
between believing and obeying God,
and the free and full exercise of reason
and free-will. Our Cincinnati
contemporary seems to have overlooked
this very obvious fact, and
has therefore imagined a contradiction
where there is none at all, but
perfect logical consistency. Our
contemporary is no doubt very able,
a great logician, but he is here grappling
with a subject which he has not
studied, and of which he knows less
than nothing.</p>

<p>It is a very general impression
with rationalists and rationalizing Protestants,
that whoso asserts the free
exercise of reason denies the authority
of the church, and that whoso
recognizes the authority of the church
necessarily denies reason and abdicates
his own manhood, which is as
much as to say that whoso asserts
man denies God, and whoso asserts
God denies man. These people
forget that the best of all possible
reasons for believing any thing is the
word, that is, the authority of God,
and that the highest possible exercise
of one's manhood is in humble and
willing obedience to the law or will
of God. All belief, as distinguished
from knowledge, is on authority of
some sort, and the only question to be
asked in any case is, Is the authority
sufficient? I believe there were such
persons as Alexander the Great, Julius
Cæsar, Charlemagne, Louis XIV.,
Robespierre, and George Washington,
on the authority of history, the
last two, also, on the testimony of
eye-witnesses, or persons who have
assured me that they had seen and
known them personally; yet in the
case of them all, my belief is belief
on authority. On authority, I believe
the great events recorded in
sacred and profane history, the building
of the Temple of Jerusalem in
the reign of Solomon, the captivity
of the Jews, their return to Judea
under the kings of Persia, the building
of the second temple, the conquest
of Jerusalem by Titus and the
Roman army, the invasion of the
Roman empire by the northern barbarians,
who finally overthrew it, the
event called the reformation, the
thirty years' war, etc. Nothing is
more unreasonable or more insane
than to believe any thing on no authority;
that is, with no reason for believing
it. To believe without authority
for believing is to believe without
reason, and practically a denial of
reason itself.</p>

<p>Catholics, in fact, are the only
people in the world who do, can, or
dare reason in matters of religion.
Indeed, they are the only people who
have a reasonable faith, and who
believe only what they have adequate
reasons for believing. They are also
the only people who recognize no
human authority, not even one's own,
in matters of Christian faith and conscience.
Sectarians and rationalists
claim to be free, and to reason freely,
because, as they pretend, they are
bound by no human authority, and
recognize no authority in faith but
their own reason. Yet why should
my reason be for me or any one else
better authority for believing than
yours? My authority is as human
as yours, and if yours is not a sufficient
reason for my faith, how can
my own suffice, which is no better,
perhaps not so good? As a fact,
no man is less free than he who has
for his faith no authority but his own
reason; for he is, if he thinks at all,
necessarily always in doubt as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
what he ought or ought not to believe;
and no man who is in doubt,
who is unable to determine what he
is or is not required to believe in
order to believe the truth, is or can
be mentally free. From this doubt
only the Catholic is free; for he only
has the authority of God, who can
neither deceive nor be deceived, for
his faith.</p>

<p>It is a great mistake to suppose
that the Catholic believes what the
church believes and teaches on any
human authority. To assume it
begs the whole question. The act
of faith the Catholic makes is, "O my
God! I believe all the sacred truths
the Holy Catholic Church believes
and teaches, <em>because</em> thou hast revealed
them, who canst neither deceive
nor be deceived." The church can
declare to be of faith only what
God has revealed, and her authority
in faith is the authority not of the
law-maker, but of the witness and
interpreter of the law. In faith we
believe the word of God, we believe
God on his word; in the last analysis,
that God is true, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Deus est verax</i>.
Better authority than the word of
God there is not and cannot be, and
nothing is or can be more reasonable
than to believe that God is true, or
to believe God on his word, without
a voucher.</p>

<p>That the church is a competent
and credible witness in the case, or
an adequate authority for believing
that God has revealed what she believes
and teaches as his word, can
be as conclusively proved as the
competency and credibility of a witness
in any case in court whatever.
She was an eye and ear-witness of
the life, works, death, and resurrection
of our Lord, who is at once perfect
God and perfect man; she received
the divine word directly from him,
and is the contemporary and living
witness of what he taught and commanded.
The church has never for
a moment ceased to exist, but has
continued from Christ to us as one
identical living body that suffers no
decay and knows no succession of
years; with her nothing has been forgotten,
for nothing has fallen into the
past. The whole revelation of God is
continually present to her mind and
heart. She is, then, a competent witness;
for she knows all the facts to
which she is required to testify. She
is a credible witness; for God himself
has appointed, commissioned, authorized
her to bear witness for him to
all nations and ages, even unto the
consummation of the world, and has
promised to be with her, and to send
to her assistance the Paraclete, the
Spirit of Truth, who should recall to
her mind whatsoever he had taught
her, and lead her into all truth. The
divine commission or authorization
to teach carries with it the pledge of
infallibility in teaching; for God cannot
be the accomplice of a false
teacher, or one who is even liable to
err. What surrender is there of one's
reason, judgment, free-will, manhood,
in believing the testimony of a competent
and credible witness?</p>

<p>In point of fact, the case is even
stronger than we put it. The church
is the body of Christ, and in her
dwelleth the Holy Ghost. She is human
in her members, no doubt; but
she is divine as well as human in her
head. The human and divine natures,
though for ever distinct, are united
in one divine person by the hypostatic
union. This one divine
Person, the Word that was made
flesh, or assumed flesh, for our redemption
and glorification, is the person
of the church, who through him
lives a divine as well as a human life.
It is God who speaks in her voice as
it was God who spoke in the voice
of the Son of Mary, that died on the
cross, that rose from the dead, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
ascended into heaven, whence he shall
come again to judge the quick and
the dead. Hence, we have not only
the word of God as the authority for
believing his revelation, but his authority
in the witness to the fact that
it is his revelation or his word that
we believe. We may even go further
still, and state that the Holy
Ghost beareth witness within us with
our spirits in concurrence with the external
witness to the same fact, so
that it may be strengthened by the
mouth of two witnesses. More ample
means of attesting the truth and
leaving the unbeliever without excuse
are not possible in the nature of
things.</p>

<p>It is not, then, the Catholic who
contradicts himself; for between the
free exercise of reason and complete
submission to the authority of the
church, as both are understood by
Catholics, there is no contradiction,
no contrariety even. Faith, by the
fact that it is faith, differs necessarily
from science. It is not intuitive or
discursive knowledge, but simply
analogical knowledge. But reason
in itself cannot go beyond what is intuitively
apprehended, or discursively
obtained, that is, obtained from intuitive
data either by way of deduction
or induction. In either case, what
is apprehended or obtained is knowledge,
not belief or faith. To believe
and to know are not one and the
same thing; and whatever reason by
itself can judge of comes under the
head of science, not faith; whence it
follows that reason can never judge
of the intrinsic truth or falsehood
of the matter of faith; for if it could,
faith would be sight, and in no sense
faith. If we recognize such a thing
as faith at all, we must recognize
something which transcends or does
not fall under the direct cognizance
of reason; and therefore that which
reason does not know, and can affirm
only as accredited by some authority
distinct from reason. The
Catholic asserts faith on authority,
certainly, but on an authority which
reason herself holds to be sufficient.
True, he does not submit the question
of its truth or falsehood to the judgment
of reason; for that would imply
a contradiction&mdash;that faith is not
faith, but sight or knowledge. This
is the mistake of sectarians and rationalists,
who deny authority in matters
of faith. They practically deny reason,
by demanding of it what exceeds
its powers; and faith, by insisting on
submitting it to the judgment of reason,
and denying that we have or
can have any reason for believing
what transcends reason. It ill becomes
them, therefore, to accuse
Catholics of contradicting themselves,
when they assert the rights of reason
in its own order, and the necessity
of authority in matters of faith, or
matters that transcend reason. They
themselves, according to their own
principles, have, and can have no authority
for believing; and therefore, if
they believe at all, they do and must
believe without reason; and belief
without reason is simple fancy, caprice,
whim, prejudice, opinion, not faith.</p>

<p>But the <cite>Christian Quarterly</cite> is not
alone in imagining a contradiction
between reason and authority. The
whole modern mind assumes it, and
imagines a contradiction wherever
it finds two extremes, or two opposites.
It has lost the middle term
that brings them together and unites
them in a logical synthesis. To it,
natural and supernatural, nature and
grace, reason and faith, science and
revelation, liberty and authority,
church and state, heaven and earth,
God and man&mdash;are irreconciliable extremes;
and not two extremes only,
but downright contradictions, which
necessarily exclude each other. It does
not, even if it accepts both terms, accept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
them as reconciled, or united as
two parts of one whole; but each
as exclusive, and warring against the
other, and each doing its best to destroy
the other.</p>

<p>Hence the modern mind is, so
to speak, bisected by a painful dualism,
which weakens its power, lowers
its character, and destroys the
unity and efficiency of intellectual
life. We meet every day men
who, on one side, assert supernatural
faith, revelation, grace, authority,
and, on the other, pure naturalism,
which excludes every thing supernatural
or divine. On the one side of
their intelligence, nothing but God and
grace, and on the other, nothing but
man and nature. Indeed, the contradiction
runs through nearly the whole
modern intellectual world, and is not
encountered among the heterodox
only. We find even men who mean
to be orthodox, think they are orthodox,
and are sincerely devoted to the
interests of religion, who yet see no
real or logical connection between
their faith as Catholics and their
principles as statesmen, or their theories
as scientists.</p>

<p>The two terms, or series of terms,
of course, must be accepted, and
neither can be denied without equally
denying the other. The objection is
not that both are asserted, but that they
are asserted as contradictories; for
no contradiction in the real world,
which is the world of truth, is admissible.
The Creator of the world is
the Logos, is logic in itself, and
therefore, as the Scripture saith, makes
all things by number, weight, and
measure. All his works are dialectic,
and form a self-consistent whole;
for, as St. Thomas says, he is the type
of all things&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Deus est similitudo
rerum omnium</i>. There must then
be, somewhere, the mediator, or middle
term which unites the two extremes,
and in which their apparent
contradiction is lost, and they are opposed
only as two parts of one uniform
whole. The defect of the modern
mind is that it has lost this middle
term, and men retain in their life
the dualism we have pointed out, because
they do not see that the conflicting
elements are not harmonizable in
their intelligence; or, because they
have lost the conception of reality,
and are false to the true principle of
things.</p>

<p>In the early ages of the church, the
fathers had no occasion to take care
that reason and nature should be
preserved, for no one dreamed of
denying them. All their efforts were
needed to bring out and vindicate the
other series of terms, God, the supernatural,
revelation, grace, faith, which
was denied or perverted by the world
they had to war against. The ascetic
writers, again, having for their object
the right disciplining of human nature
through grace, which includes revelation
and faith, as well as the elevation
and assistance of nature and
reason, had just as little occasion to
assert reason and nature, for they
assumed them, and their very labors
implied them. Grace, or the supernatural,
was rarely exaggerated or set
forth as exclusive. The danger came
chiefly from the opposite quarter,
from Pelagianism, or the assertion of
the sufficiency of nature without
grace.</p>

<p>When, however, the reformers appeared,
the danger shifted sides. The
doctrines of the reformation, the doctrines
of grace, as they are called by
evangelicals, were an exaggerated and
exclusive supernaturalism. The reformers
did not merely assert the insufficiency
of reason and nature, but
went further, and asserted their
total depravity, and utter worthlessness
in the Christian life. They
made man not merely passive under
grace, but actively and necessarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
opposed to it, resisting it always with
all his might, and to be overcome
only by sovereign grace, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gratia
victrix</i> of the Jansenists. The church
met this and its kindred errors in the
holy Council of Trent, and while
affirming the supernatural element,
and defining the sphere and office of
grace, rescued nature and reaffirmed
its part in the work of life. But error
has no principle and is bound to no
consistency, and the Catholic has
ever since had to defend nature
against the exclusive supernaturalists,
and grace against the exclusive naturalists;
reason, for instance, against
the traditionalists, and revelation and
authority against the rationalists. To
do this, it has been and still is necessary
to distinguish between the two
orders, nature and grace, natural
and supernatural, reason and faith.</p>

<p>But we find a very considerable
number of men who are not exclusively
supernaturalists, nor exclusively
rationalists, but who are syncretists, or
both at once. They accept both orders
in their mutual exclusiveness,
and alternately, rather, simultaneously,
assert exclusive supernaturalism,
and exclusive rationalism. This is the
case with the great mass of Protestants,
who retain any reminiscences
of grace, and even with some Catholics
in countries where Jansenism
once had its stronghold, and where
traces of its influence may still be detected
with people who deny its formally
heretical propositions, and accept
the papal constitutions condemning
them. The two extremes are seen,
and both are accepted; but the mediator
between them, or the truth
which conciliates or harmonizes them,
seems to be overlooked or not understood.
Of course, Catholic theology
asserts it, and is in reality based
on it; but, some how or other, the
age does not seize it, and the prevailing
philosophy does not recognize it.</p>

<p>The problem for our age, it seems
to us, is to revive it, and show
the conciliation of the two extremes.
The labor of theologians and philosophers
is not, indeed, to find a new
and unknown truth or medium of
reconciliation, as so many pretend,
but to bring out to the dull and enfeebled
understanding of our times the
great truth, always asserted by Catholic
theology, which conciliates all extremes
by presenting the real and
living synthesis of things. This Father
Hewit has attempted and in great
part achieved in his <i>Problems of the
Age</i>.</p>

<p>There can be no question that the
dominant philosophy, especially with
the heterodox, does not present the
conditions of solving this problem, and
the scholastic philosophy, as taught
in Catholic schools, needs to be
somewhat differently developed and
expressed before the age can see in
it the solution demanded. According
to the philosophy generally received
since Des Cartes, the natural
and supernatural are not only distinct,
but separate orders, and reason
without any aid from revelation
is competent to construct from
her own materials a complete science
of the rational order. It supposes
the two orders to be independent
each of the other, and each
complete in itself. Reason has nothing
to do with faith, and faith has
nothing to do with reason. The
church has no jurisdiction in philosophy,
the sciences, politics, or natural
society; philosophers, physicists,
statesmen, seculars, so long as they
keep in the rational order, are independent
of the spiritual authority,
are under no obligation to consult revelation,
or to conform to the teachings
of faith. Hence the dual life
men live, and the absurdity of maintaining
in one order what they contradict
in another.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>This, we need not say, is all wrong.
The two orders are distinct, not separate
and mutually independent orders,
nor parallel orders with no real or logical
relation between them. They are,
in reality, only two parts of one and
the same whole. We do not undertake
to say what God could or
could not have done had he chosen.
If he could have created man and
left him in a state of pure nature, as
he has the animals, we know he has
not done so. He has created man
for a supernatural destiny, and placed
him under a supernatural or gracious
providence, so that, as a fact, man is
never in a state of pure nature. He
aspires to a supernatural reward, and
is liable to a supernatural punishment.
His life is always above pure nature,
or below it. The highest natural
virtue is imperfect, and no sin is simply
a sin against the natural law. The
natural is not the supernatural, but
was never intended to subsist without
it. The supernatural is not an interpolation
in the divine plan of creation,
nor something superinduced upon
it, but is a necessary complement of the
natural, which never is or can be
completed in the natural alone. In
the divine plan, the two orders are
coeval, always coexist, and operate
simultaneously to one and the same
end, as integral parts of one whole.
The natural, endowed with reason
and free-will, may resist the supernatural,
or refuse to co-operate with
it; but if it does so, it must remain
inchoate, incomplete, an existence
commenced yet remaining for ever
unfulfilled, which is the condition of
the reprobate. A true and adequate
philosophy explains man's origin,
medium, and end; and no such philosophy
can be constructed by reason
alone; for these are supernatural, and
are fully known only through a supernatural
revelation.</p>

<p>The natural demands the supernatural;
so also does the supernatural
demand the natural. If there were no
nature, there could be nothing above
nature; there would be nothing for
grace to operate on, to assist, or complete.
If man had no reason, he
could receive no revelation; if he had
no free-will, he could have no virtue,
no sanctity; if not generated, he
could not be regenerated; and if not
regenerated, he could not be glorified,
or attain to the end for which he is
intended. To deny nature is to deny
the creative act of God, and to fall
into pantheism&mdash;a sophism, for pantheism
is denied in its very assertion.
Its assertion implies the
assertor, and therefore something
capable of acting, and therefore a
substantive existence, distinguishable
from God. The denial of God, as
creator, is the denial alike of man,
the natural, and the supernatural.
To solve the problem, and remove
the dualism which bisects the modern
mind, it is necessary to study the
Creator's works in the light of the
Creator's plan, and as a whole, in the
whole course or itinerary of their existence,
or in their procession from
him as first cause, to their return to
him as final cause, and not piecemeal,
as isolated or unrelated facts. If
we know not this plan, which no
study of the works themselves can
reveal to us, we can never get at
the meaning of a single the smallest
part, far less attain to any thing like
the science of the universe; for the
meaning of each part is in its relation
to the whole. What is the meaning
of this grain of sand on the sea-shore,
or this mosquito, this gnat, these
animalculæ invisible to the naked
eye? Have they no meaning, no
purpose in the Creator's plan?
What can you, by reason, know of
that purpose or meaning, if you know
not that plan? Your physical sciences,
without a knowledge of that plan, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
no sciences at all, and give you no
more conception of the universe than
a specimen brick from its walls can
give you of the city of Babylon.</p>

<p>Though that plan is and can be
known only as revealed by God himself,
yet when once known we may see
analogies and proofs of it in all the
Creator's works, and study with profit
the several parts of the universe, and
attain to real science of them; for then
we can study them in their synthesis,
or their relation to the whole. We
may then have rational science, not
built on revelation, but constructed
by reason in the light of revelation.
We do not make revelation the basis
of the natural sciences. They are all
constructed by reason, acting with its
own power, but under the supervision,
so to speak, of faith, which reveals to
it the plan or purpose of creation, to
which it must conform in its deductions
and inductions, if they are to
have any scientific value. If it operates
in disregard of revelation, without
the light radiating from the
Creator's plan, reason can know
objects only in their isolation, as
separate and unrelated facts or phenomena,
and therefore never know
them, as they really are, or in their
real significance; because nothing in
the universe exists in a state of isolation,
or by and for itself alone; but
every thing that exists, exists and is
significant only in its relation to the
whole. It is a mistake, then, to
assume that the church, the witness,
guardian, and interpreter of the faith
or revelation, has nothing to say to
philosophy, or to the physical sciences,
cosmogony, geology, physiology, history,
or even political science. None
of them are or can be true sciences,
any further than they present the several
classes of facts and phenomena
of which they treat in their respective
relations and subordination to the
divine plan of creation, known only
by the revelation committed to the
church.</p>

<p>The principle of the solution of
the problem, or the middle term that
unites the two extremes, or the natural
and the supernatural, in a real and
living synthesis, or reconciles all opposites,
is the creative act of God.
The supernatural is God himself, and
what he does immediately without
using any natural agencies; the natural
is what God creates with the
power to act as second cause, and
what he does only through second
causes, or so-called natural laws. Nothing
is natural that is not explicable
by natural laws, and nothing so explicable
is properly supernatural,
though it may be superhuman. A
miracle is an effect of which God is
the immediate cause, and which can
be referred to no natural or second
cause; a natural event is one of which
God is not the direct and immediate
cause, but only first cause&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Causa
eminens</i>, or cause of its direct and
immediate cause. The copula or
<i>nexus</i> that unites the natural and
supernatural in one dialectic whole, is
the creative act of the supernatural,
or God, which produces the natural
and holds it joined to its cause.
Creatures are not separable from their
Creator; for in him they live and
move and are, or have their being;
and were he to separate himself from
them, or suspend his creative act,
they would instantly drop into the
nothing they were before he produced
them. The relation between them
and him is their relation of entire dependence
on him for all they are, all
they have, and all they can do.
There is, then, no ground of antagonism
between him and them. If
man aspires to act independently of
God, he simply aspires to be himself
God, and becomes&mdash;nothing.</p>

<p>But we have not exhausted the
creative act. God creates all things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
for an end, and this end is himself;
not that he may gain something for
himself, or increase his own beatitude,
which is eternally complete, and can
be neither augmented nor diminished,
but that he may communicate of his
beatitude to creatures which he has
called into existence. Hence God is
first cause and final cause. We proceed
from him as first cause, and return
to him as final cause, as we have
shown again and again in the magazine
with all the necessary proofs.</p>

<p>Between God as final cause, and
his creatures, the mediator is the
Incarnate Word, or the man Christ
Jesus, the only mediator between
God and men. In Christ Jesus is
hypostatically united in one divine
person the divine nature and the
human, which, however, remain for
ever distinct, without intermixture or
confusion. This union is effected by
the creative act, which in it is carried
to its summit. The hypostatic
union completes the first cycle or procession
of existences from God as first
cause, and initiates their return to
him as final cause, as we have said
in our remarks on <i>Primeval Man</i>.
It completes generation and initiates
the regeneration, or palingenesiac
order, which has its completion or
fulfilment in glorification, the intuitive
vision of God by the light of
glory, or, as say the schoolmen, <i>ens
supernaturale</i>.</p>

<p>Theologians understand usually, by
the supernatural order, the order
founded by the Incarnation or hypostatic
union, the regeneration propagated
by the election of grace, instead
of natural generation. But
between the natural and the supernatural,
in this sense, the <i>nexus</i> or middle
term is the creative act effecting
the hypostatic union, or God
himself mediating in his human nature.
The Incarnation unites God and
man, without intermixture or confusion,
in one and the same divine Person,
and also the order of generation
with the order of regeneration, of
which glorification is the crown. But as
the two natures remain for ever distinct
but inseparable in one person,
so, in the order of regeneration, the
natural and the supernatural are each
preserved in its distinctive though inseparable
activity.</p>

<p>These three terms, generation, regeneration,
glorification, one in the
creative act of God, cover the entire
life of man, and in each the natural
and supernatural, distinct but inseparable,
remain and co-operate and act.
There is no dualism in the world of
reality, and none is apparent&mdash;except
the distinction between God and creature&mdash;when
the Creator's works are
seen as a whole, in their real relation
and synthesis. The dualism results in
the mind from studying the Creator's
works in their analytic divisions, instead
of their synthetic relations; especially
from taking the first cycle or order
of generation as an independent order,
complete in itself, demanding
nothing beyond itself, and constituting
the whole life of man, instead of
taking it, as it really is, only as the
beginning, the initial, or the inchoate
stage of life, subordinated to the second
cycle, the teleological order, or
regeneration and glorification, in
which alone is its complement, perfection,
ultimate end, for which it
has been created, and exists. Our
age falls into its heresies, unbeliefs,
and intellectual anarchy and confusion,
because it undertakes to separate
what God has joined together&mdash;philosophy
from theology, reason
from faith, science from revelation,
nature from grace&mdash;and refuses to
study the works and providence of
God in their synthetic relations, in
which alone is their true meaning.</p>

<p>The Positivists understand very
well the anarchy that reigns in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
modern intellectual world, and the
need of a doctrine which can unite
in one all the scattered and broken
rays of intelligence and command
the adhesion of all minds. The
church, they say, once had such a
doctrine, and for a thousand years led
the progress of science and society.
Protestants, they assert, have never
had, and never, as Protestants, can
have any doctrine of the sort, and
the church has it no longer. It is
nowhere set forth except in the writings
of Auguste Comte, who obtains
it not from revelation, theology, or
metaphysics, but from the sciences,
or the positive facts of nature studied
in their synthetic relations. But unhappily,
though right in asserting the
necessity of a grand synthetic doctrine
which shall embrace all the
knowable and all the real, they forget
that facts cannot be studied in
their synthetic relations unless the
mind is previously in possession of
the grand synthetic doctrine which
embraces and explains them, while the
doctrine itself cannot be had till they
are so studied. They must take the
end as the means of gaining the end!
This is a hard case, for till they get
the synthetic formula they can only
have unrelated facts, hypotheses, and
conjectures, with no means of verifying
them. They are not likely to
succeed. Starting from anarchy, they
can only arrive at anarchy. Only
God can move by his Spirit over
chaos, and bring order out of confusion
and light out of darkness.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Positivists do not
reconcile the conflicting elements;
for they suppress one of the two
series of terms, and relegate God,
the supernatural, principles, causes,
and supersensible relations into the
region of the unknowable, and include
in their grand synthesis only positive
sensible facts or phenomena and
their physical laws. They thus restrict
man's existence to the first
cycle, and exclude the second or
palingenesiac order, in which alone
reigns the moral law. The first or
initial cycle does not contain the
word of the <i>ænigma</i>. It does not
exist for itself, and therefore is not
and cannot be intelligible in or by
itself. If they could succeed in removing
the anarchy complained of,
they would do so by ignorance, not
science, and harmonize all intelligences
only by annihilating them.</p>

<p>Nor is it true that the church has
lost or abandoned her grand synthetic
doctrine, or that her synthesis has
ceased to be complete, or sufficiently
comprehensive. Her doctrine is
Christianity; and Christianity leaves
out no ancient or modern science;
has not been and cannot be outgrown
by any actual or possible progress of
intelligence; for it embraces at once
all the real and all the knowable, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">reale
omne et scibile</i>. If the church fails
to command the adhesion of all
minds, it is not because any minds
have advanced in science beyond her,
or have attained to any truth or virtue
she has not; but because they
have fallen below her, have become
too contracted and grovelling in their
views to grasp the elevation and universality
of her doctrine. She still
leads the civilized world, and commands
the faith and love of the really
enlightened portion of mankind. The
reason why so many in our age refuse
her their adhesion is not because
her doctrine or mode or manner of
presenting it are defective, but because
they are engrossed with the development
and application of the physical
or natural laws, or with the first or
initial cycle, and exhaust themselves
in the production, exchange, and accumulation
of physical goods, which,
however attractive to the inchoate or
physical man, are of no moral or religious
value. The cause is not in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the church but in them; in the fact
that their minds and hearts are set
on those things only after which the
heathen seek; and they have no relish
for any truth that pertains to the
teleological or moral order.</p>

<p>The church does not object to the
study of the natural or physical sciences,
nor to the accumulation of
material wealth; but she does object
to making the initial order the teleological,
and to the cultivation of the
sciences or study of the physical laws
for their own sake; for, with her, not
knowledge but wisdom is the principal
thing. She requires the physical
and psychological sciences to be cultivated
for the sake of the ultimate end
of man, and in subordination to the
Christian law which that end prescribes.
So of material wealth; she
does not censure its production, its
exchange, or its accumulation, if honestly
done, and in subordination to
the end for which man is created.
What she demands of us is that we
conform to the Creator's plan, and
esteem things according to their true
order and place in that plan. She
tolerates no falsehood in thought,
word, or deed.</p>

<p>The natural is not suppressed or
injured by being subordinated to the
supernatural, for it can be fulfilled
only in the supernatural. We find
the indications of this in nature herself.
There are, indeed, theologians
who talk of a natural beatitude; but
whether possible or not, God has not
so made us that we can find our beatitude
in nature; that is, in the creature
or a created good. He has
made us for himself, and the soul can
be satisfied with nothing less. This
is the great fact elaborated by Father
Hecker in his <i>Questions of the Soul</i>,
and his <i>Aspirations of Nature</i>. In
the first work, he shows that the soul
asks questions which nature cannot
answer, but which are answered in
the supernatural; in the second, he
shows that nature desires, craves, aspires
to, and has a capacity for, the
supernatural; that the soul is conscious
of wants which only the supernatural
can fill. Man has, as St.
Thomas teaches, a natural desire
to see God in the beatific vision;
that is, to see him as he is in himself;
to be like him, to partake of
his divine nature, to possess him, and
be filled with him. This alone can
satisfy the soul, and hence holy Job
says, "I shall be satisfied when I
awake in thy likeness."</p>

<p>There can be no real antagonism
between the natural and the supernatural;
for there can be none between
nature and its Creator, and
equally none between it and its fulfilment,
or supreme good. There is
none, we have shown, between reason
and faith, any more than there
is between the eye and the telescope,
which extends its range of vision,
and enables it to see what it could
not see without it. There can be
none between science and revelation;
when the science is real science and
is cultivated not for itself alone, but
as a means to the true end of man;
and there can be none between earth
and heaven, when the earth is regarded
solely as a medium and not
confounded with the end. There
can be none between liberty and authority;
for man can be man, possess
himself, be himself, and free only by
living in conformity to the law of his
existence, or according to the plan of
the Creator; and finally there can be
none between church and state, if
the state remembers that it is in the
teleological order, and under the moral
law, therefore subordinated to the
spiritual order.</p>

<p>We have passed over a great number
of important questions, several
of which, on starting, we intended to
consider, and some of which we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
take up hereafter; but we have given,
we think, the principle that solves the
problem of the age, and shows that
the dualism which runs through and
disturbs so many minds has no foundation
either in the teaching of the
church or in the real order. The
Creator's works all hang together, are
all parts of one uniform plan, and
the realization <i>ad extra</i> of one divine
thought, of which the archetype is in
his own infinite, eternal, and ineffable
essence. The trouble with men is,
that many of them do not see that
the church is catholic, even when
professing to believe it; because their
own minds are not catholic. They
often suppose they are broader than
the church, because they are too
narrow to see her breadth. They
also fancy that there are fields of
science which they may cultivate
which lie beyond her catholicity, and
concerning which they are under no
obligation to consult her. This
shows that they understand neither
her catholicity nor the nature, conditions,
and end of science. They
contract the church to their own
narrow dimensions.</p>

<p>We conclude by saying that the
men who undertake to criticise the
church, and to unchurch her, are
men who want breadth, depth, and
elevation. They are mole-eyed, and
have slender claims to be regarded
as really enlightened, large-minded,
large-hearted men.</p>

<p class="center">TRANSLATED FROM LE CORRESPONDANT.</p>

<h2>PAGANINA.</h2>


<h3>XVIII.</h3>

<p>We must not conclude that Master
Swibert gave only a musical education
to his child. His instruction
was solid, and intended, beyond every
thing, to develop in her a religious
sentiment.</p>

<p>For metaphysics he had a love that
years had not lessened. His philosophy
was very simple; a few lines
could comprise it&mdash;only what he
took a liking to; and he never pretended
to have invented it.</p>

<p>His soul exercised itself in applying
every creature as a connection with
the Infinite. He said summarily that
if a thinker could not so comprehend
things, he retarded his progress and
lost his end.</p>

<p>Paganina could not always understand
her father, but this did not distress
him. Like the good laborer, he
sowed thickly the land he had prepared,
knowing well that much would
be lost; but knowing, too, that he
would come, some day, and find the
luxuriant verdure that would repay
his pains.</p>

<p>The young girl adopted with eagerness
all that could elevate character
and ennoble life. Happy to repose
in the artistic emotions that shook
her so deeply, she relaxed into the
serene contemplation of the truth toward
which her father conducted her.</p>


<h3>XIX.</h3>

<p>Such, in its principal characteristics,
is the life Paganina led until she
was twenty-two years of age. Her
beauty had developed radiantly. She
held her head aloft, as one who looks
on high; and her eyes so sought the
distance that she won the name of
proud from the good women who
met her in their daily walks.</p>

<p>She never was without her father,
and the contrast between the two
was painful. He was an old man&mdash;more
from the effect of sickness than
old age; and although he appeared
active, it was easy to see that, undermined
by an inward malady, he would
soon be completely wrecked.</p>

<p>He felt it himself, and employed
all his strength to instruct and enlighten
his daughter.</p>

<p>Without saddening her in advance,
by announcing his approaching malady,
he endeavored to accustom her
to a future separation, but she could
not comprehend it. The last thing
in which youth can believe is the rupture
of holy affections. It never
learns that such love can be interrupted.</p>

<p>One day, Master Swibert and his
daughter were seated at the turn of
the road, where they generally rested
in their daily walk. The organist
returned to the subject with which his
mind was always preoccupied&mdash;that
future in which he had no part&mdash;and
finished by saying, "My daughter,
your cousin loves you. What he felt
for you here he has not lost by separation;
his heart is devotedly yours.
You are all in all to him, and I have
long understood his affection for you.
I should feel happy to know you returned
his love."</p>

<p>Paganina, surprised, replied, "I
love but you, my father; must you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
leave me?" The organist replied by
this verse of St. Paul, "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Insipiens: tu
quod seminas, non vivificatur, nisi
prius moriatur</i>", and Paganina, who
did not know Latin, began to weep.</p>

<p>From this day, Master Swibert declined
rapidly. He made what he
called his will; his last instructions,
only to arm his daughter for the
struggles of life. He urged her to
see, through him, the immortality of
the soul; so especially visible in the
early Christians, in the mournful hour
when, their bodies, falling to ruin, betrayed
the interior flame that disengaged
them from earth, to shine for
ever among the stars in unfading lustre.</p>

<p>After several days of agony, the
good musician found his peroration.
He died.</p>

<p>It was morning. He had talked a
long time with his daughter, and the
peace he enjoyed announced the end
of the struggle. His large, troubled
eyes looked once more toward the
mountain, on her, and on his crucifix,
then closed for ever.</p>


<h3>XX.</h3>

<p>The world&mdash;even the best of it&mdash;don't
like to be entertained with the
sufferings of others; so I will not stop
to relate those of Paganina. I will
pause longer on the chapter of her
consolations. She drew these from
two sources, her memories and her
labors.</p>

<p>Her memories were realities. She
felt that her father had never left her;
and lived in his presence, meditating
on and practising his lessons. Her
ardor for the study of her art redoubled.
Often in the silence of the
night, at a late hour, her voice was
heard by an admiring crowd beneath
her window. The young artist, without
knowing or desiring it, became
popular.</p>

<p>She had other joys, too, which
helped her to live her isolated life.
It is not of those of love I speak.
Paganina did not know the passion.
She lived apart from the world, and
her character became half legendary.
Fancy held play where love was excluded;
and in the regions of the
ideal grew her immortal works, and
their imperishable beauty, to be shed
on humanity.</p>

<p>Perhaps the memory of such things
should only be intruded on the very
few; for it is said that often a ray
from on high illuminated the chamber
where the young girl sat, and in
that moment she felt a new world
tremble in her heart.</p>


<h3>XXI.</h3>

<p>Happiness is not the guest of earth.
The miserable and deceptive pleasure
that pretends to this glorious name
is a bait rather than a food, and
never nourishes any body. Therefore
such moments as we have spoken
of are fugitive, and are mostly
followed by exhaustion and bitter disgust,
which would be a good price
for them, could such moments be
paid for. Paganina experienced the
common law. She could not live on
ecstasy. Her days, therefore, were
mingled and diverse.</p>

<p>I must relate the crisis of her life;
but I turn with regret to the chamber
that sheltered her genius and her innocence.
I see in spirit&mdash;shut in
this place&mdash;a treasure that no one
was permitted to contemplate; for
Paganina bloomed in the shade, and
reserved for her solitude her beauty
and the perfume of her loveliness.</p>

<p>Sometimes, only when debauch
slept and idleness prolonged its useless
repose, the beautiful young girl
appeared before her opened window.
Robed with the reflection of the aurora,
she saluted the growing day;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and, as the antique statue, she exhaled
divine harmony by contact with its
earliest rays.</p>


<h3>XXII.</h3>

<p>Having, not without success, terminated
his musical studies, André
quitted Naples. His affection for his
cousin had greatly increased. Love
sang in his heart; for, if we may borrow
such an expression from the poetical
vocabulary, it assuredly belongs
to a musician.</p>

<p>From the day he was free, he had
but one desire&mdash;to see Paganina. He
set out with this intention, and restless
regarding his reception. Indeed,
his future depended upon it.</p>

<p>During the journey, his thoughts
went ahead, and heaped up every
imaginable supposition on the manner
in which his cousin would receive
him; but she did not receive him at
all. He entered a deserted mansion.</p>

<p>He wandered among the deserted
places, where every thing recalled the
days of his childhood. Death had
passed by, and left, perhaps, some unknown
scourge. In his poignant distress,
he imagined the worst.</p>

<p>Perhaps he did not deceive himself.
Paganina was to appear the
next day at the theatre of Milan.</p>

<p>I must add that she was always
worthy of her father, in the strictest
sense of the word; though for three
months, it is true, in order to prepare
herself for the stage, she had mixed
in the world of the theatres, and,
what is far worse, in the world of parasites,
insinuating themselves by every
means and with every end. She
breathed a poisoned air in the incense
of impure flatteries. Her bitter contempt
prevented its injuring her; but
as soon as she was free, she ran to
conceal her wounds in a retreat where
no one could discover her.</p>


<h3>XXIII.</h3>

<p class="center">Extract from the <cite>Gazette of Lombardy</cite>, the 20th
of September, 18&mdash;.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Her father was German, her mother
an Italian; her father belonged to the
church, her mother to the theatre. Both
were superior musicians. Such a birth
could promise her a more than common
destiny, and this birth had a singular
predestination. She was born in the side-scenes
of the theatre during a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soirée</i>, the
memory of which is still fresh among us.
Her first cries were drowned in the passionate
strains of the violin of Paganini,
and the bursts of admiration from his auditory.
The little creature, as if in reply to
the powerful invocation of the master, appeared
before the hour fixed by nature.</p>

<p>"This is all her history. From that hour
she disappeared. Without doubt, the new-born
vestal sought the retreat of the sacred
fire.</p>

<p>"To-day she returns to the place of her
birth. The words are literally true; we will
hear her this evening in La Scala.</p>

<p>"I have desired to announce this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</i>.
Let no one fail to be there, for I predict it
will be an event.</p>

<p>"My task is finished. I would like to
describe this cantatrice, but she belongs to
no formula. It would require two to express
the dualism of which her person and
character bear the imprint.</p>

<p>"She seems to have received from her
parents two natures which by turns inspire
her. Even now we hear her pure and
original voice mount to heaven; no breath
of human passion seems to agitate it. We
listen enchanted, lifted far above ourselves,
and share the serenity, the peace she inspires;
suddenly the air changes, the color
mounts to her cheeks, passion absorbs her,
and she bursts out in its most marvellous
tones. I could see the spectre of the old
Paganini grimacing by the side of his beautiful
god-child, and goading on her enchained
genius."</p></blockquote>


<h3>XXIV.</h3>

<p>The result was as predicted. The
young cantatrice excited immense enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The Italians are quickly roused,
and never sell the evidences of
their admiration. To show more
than ordinary emotion, they invent
unheard-of and extravagant expressions.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>When Paganina could withdraw
from these ovations, the night was
far advanced; she took refuge in
solitude.</p>

<p>Let us follow her. It will be curious
to observe in her the intoxication
of applause, and see how she bore
her first triumph&mdash;she who had elicited
such flattering testimony of love
and admiration.</p>

<p>She wept, but not with happy
emotions.</p>

<p>"My father," she cried, "my father,
you are already revenged. To
punish me, you have fulfilled my desires.
I wished for the clatter of
applause, for the tumult of bravos.
I am satisfied already. Is it for this,
great God, that I have deserted thy
ways? Is it for such fugitive pleasure,
whose bitterness I have known
before even I have tasted it? O
happiness of solitude! ineffable family
joys! where have you fled?</p>

<p>"Those who have just applauded
me little know the inexpressible sadness
that overcame me. For a moment
despair drew tears to my eyes.
They thought it the triumph of my
art&mdash;but I wept for thee, my father;
for thee, my childhood&mdash;and the
peace of the old, happy hours."</p>

<p>André at this moment appeared.</p>


<h3>XXV.</h3>

<p>He watched her in silence&mdash;he on
the threshold, and she half turning
toward him proudly in her surprise.</p>

<p>André was the first to break the
silence.</p>

<p>"Paganina," said he, "I come
from the home that you have left. I
found the house deserted, and I went
to seek you at the tomb of your father."</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied with bitterness,
"and you find me here in the garb
of a comedian. What do you wish
with me?"</p>

<p>"I wish to snatch you from this
cursed place; to fly with you so far
that you may forget this fatal evening,
and again become obedient to
the voice of your father. Come, I
will be your protector, your guardian,
your slave&mdash;until the day," he added
in a lower voice, "when I dare
breathe to you my secret, and tell
you that I love you."</p>

<p>"André, listen to me. I will speak
to you sincerely. I wish to love you.
I swear to you I wish it. To quit
this country, fly with you, go into
Germany and inhabit the house of
my father, and there raise a family,
would be my happiness; but it can
never be."</p>

<p>"The love I bear you, Paganina,
has taken deep root. Near you alone
am I happy; but if it must be so,
speak! If you have given your heart
to a man worthy of you, tell me, and
destroy in me all hope for ever. For
you I can bear any thing. But if it
is not so, do not answer me yet.
Wait; my humility may disarm you,
and some day my patience may end
in moving your heart."</p>

<p>"No! my heart is but ashes; no
affection blooms nor will bloom within
it. It is too late."</p>

<p>"Do not speak so, I beg of you.
You do not know what the future
has in store for you, nor see the Providence
that watches over you. It
has sent me to you, and with me the
remembrance of happy years and the
presence of your father."</p>

<p>"The angel itself is not yet arrested
in its fall. Go! let me hang
suspended between the heaven that
is shut against me, and the abyss
whose depths I seek."</p>

<p>She burst into tears. André, after
a silence, approached her.</p>

<p>"Paganina," said he, "do not
weep. Come; see! the dawn already
whitens the fields. Let the God of
the morning comfort you. The wind
rises forerunner of a new day. Bathe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
your forehead in its breath, and respire
with its penetrating odors the
forgetfulness of your sufferings. To-day,
perhaps, will bring us back peace
and happiness."</p>

<p>"No, to-day will be fatal. The
beauty of the morning moves me no
longer; for me the evening fires, the
flames of the foot-lights, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</i> of
triumph. I will go from <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</i> to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</i>,
from ovation to ovation. I want the
whirlpool of the world to seize and
carry me until I lose my health&mdash;and
forget every thing. Immediately I
set out for the Château Sarrasin."</p>

<p>"Ah! this, then," cried André
with a sudden explosion of passion,
"this, then, is the secret of your resistance
and the avowal of your
shame. The public cry that brought
me here had already warned me. I
refused to listen to it. Well, go;
but fear every thing. You have roused
in me a monster that I knew not
of."</p>

<p>And raising his hands to heaven,
the unhappy one fled.</p>


<h3>XXVI.</h3>

<p>Paganina was calumniated by her
cousin; she was pure, though it is
true she slid on a fatal declivity.
Already appearances were against
her reputation. André was deceived;
but he was not the only one; and
from thence the reports to which he
had made allusion, and the pretext
of which will be explained.</p>

<p>The Count Ludovic, proprietor of
the Château Sarrasin and actual head
of the house of the Ligonieri, inscribed
in the golden book of European
aristocracy, was a man of proud
appearances, endowed with masculine
beauty quite in accordance with
his character; for he was superior to
his race, and possessed many noble
qualities.</p>

<p>His life was not without stain; but
even his faults bore that chivalrous
character that renders them honorable
in the eyes of the world. We
well know that the code of the world
is not that of the saints.</p>

<p>And the Count Ludovic, who willingly
mingled with the people of the
theatre, had known Paganina while
she was preparing for her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">début</i>. At
the first glance he had rightly judged
the soul of the young artist, and saw
her superior to her companions.</p>

<p>His heart was touched. Penetrated
with sincere sentiments, he preserved
in her presence an attitude of
reserve and respect, and his influence
was secretly employed to isolate and
protect her. His manner toward
her was observed; for it was not his
usual way of adding to the conquests
for which he was famous. It might
have been believed a mutual admiration;
but it is not well to credit the
judgments of one's neighbors.</p>

<p>The Count Ludovic wished to
celebrate the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">début</i> of Paganina by
one of those <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fêtes</i> that an ostentatious
tradition had preserved in his
family. He made important preparations
at the Château Sarrasin and
sent out his invitations.</p>

<p>The delicate point was to gain for
his project her who was the soul of it;
so he proposed it to her at the moment
when she received her first applause,
trusting, no doubt, to her excitement
and wish for future conquests.
He knew his auditory
would be of the first distinction; he
knew his motive&mdash;but no matter.</p>

<p>The young girl, warned as if by instinct,
feeling herself at the fatal point
of her destiny, made him no reply.
The next day, under the influence of
her bad angel, she consented.</p>


<h3>XXVII.</h3>

<p>They set out alone in an open
chariot. The Count Ludovic had
proposed for himself a gallant <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>,
without, however, the desired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
success; for all day long Paganina
spoke not a word. Her wandering
looks were on the horizon, perhaps
there to discover the mysterious and
avenging power with which she believed
herself menaced.</p>

<p>Toward evening they arrived at
Arèse. The young cantatrice was
recognized and applauded; but she
appeared totally unconscious of
sight or sound, and maintained her
obstinate silence. The count had
long since renounced all effort at
conversation. He rather liked the
oddity of the adventure, and dreamed
of the legend where the paladin
carried away his bride and wondered
she was pale&mdash;so pale that she was
dead.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the carriage labored
on the declivity of the road to Germany.
The heat was excessive, not
a breath stirred the air; but a dull
and heavy murmuring announced
that the midday wind was pent up
in the higher mountain regions.
The setting sun was red as blood.
At a turn of the road, Paganina
shuddered, for she saw André on a
rock above them; she could never
explain by what energy of passion he
had reached this point.</p>

<p>When the carriage neared him he
seized the branch of a tree, and,
throwing it before the horses' feet,
cried out, "Paganina, stop! or, by
the soul of thy father, be cursed for
ever!" The Count Ludovic had
some difficulty in managing his
frightened horses; he did not observe
that his companion was as pale as
the bride of the paladin.</p>

<p>A little further on, in returning, he
saw the same man in the same place,
illuminated by the burning sky, and
pointing with the laugh of a madman
to the black mass of the Château
Sarrasin.</p>

<p>The adventure was becoming
more and more singular. The count
wondered what part this man took in
this unheard-of drama.</p>

<p>He was too much the gentleman
to betray any surprise; but he profited
by the incident to renew his efforts at
conversation. "Do you know," he
said to Paganina, "that these slight
accidents might have had a tragical
ending? The horses we drive have
already caused the death of a man,
and, like those of the fable, may be
said to feed their ferocity on human
blood. The whip has never touched
them. If it had not been my pride
to place at your disposal the most
beautiful equipage in the world, I
should have hesitated to trust you to
them."</p>

<p>Still she did not reply. But the
moment was approaching when she
would speak, and in terrible words
reveal her anguish.</p>

<p>The carriage entered the road that
ended at the Château Sarrasin. As
we said before, this road descends by
a steep and dangerous declivity, and
on the very edge of the precipice.
The horses walked quietly. Seizing
the whip, Paganina struck them violently,
crying out,</p>

<p>"Go on, then! Is it not said that
you can lead to death?"</p>

<p>"To death, indeed!" cried the
count, surprised and alarmed. "In
this road, and at this hour, a miracle
only can save us."</p>

<p>The horses, breathing fire, made
frightful bounds, leaving starry tracks
behind them. The stones rolled
heavily into the abyss. The few inhabitants
of these solitudes, stopping
on the borders of the road, looked on
pale and as in a dream, to see this
fantastic chariot drawn by such furious
horses, while a young girl,
standing, and her hair flying in the
wind, lashed them on to desperation.</p>

<p>If it needed a miracle to save them,
this miracle took place. The team
stopped; upset the carriage on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
steps of the château. One of the
horses was killed, the carriage broken
to pieces. The count sprang up safe
and sound, his first inquiry for Paganina.</p>

<p>"I am here," she replied; "the
hand of God has led us hither."</p>

<p>With her intention, such words
were blasphemy; but she spoke in
delirium.</p>


<h3>XXVIII.</h3>

<p>Paganina, leaning on the arm of
the count, promenades with him the
highest terrace. The guests, in
groups at a distance, regard them
with hungry eyes.</p>

<p>A hot and violent wind agitates
the half-stripped trees. The clouds
traverse the sky hurriedly and quickly,
and their moving shadows rest on
the mountains. The moon, disengaging
itself here and there, throws
its pure light on the white form of
the young girl. She seems to grow
in the estimation of the admirers who
seek her.</p>

<p>The Count Ludovic is strangely
moved. His sincere sentiments are
rekindled by the newness of the situation,
and the strangeness of the adventure.
He thanks his companion
for having, at one stroke, played with
their two lives. Exalted and nervous,
enervated with the perfume of
the life that she had so nearly lost
only a few moments before, Paganina
replies to him. The observers of the
scene listen attentively. Detached
from the murmur of the distant
storm, their words are heard for a
moment, but the tempest again arises
and carries them away in its roar.
Yes, ardent and mysterious breath,
bear away these words of irony, of
revolt, and of despair&mdash;bear afar the
bitter laugh that accompanies them.</p>

<p>For a long time, O powerful
voice! have men listened to your
painful harmony. Long have you
roamed the earth, picking up the
notes of grief, the cries of the new-born,
the sobs of mothers, the sighs
of the dying, and the groaning of the
crowds who groan and groan on.
But never, never have you borne
away any thing more sad or desolate
than the laugh of this unhappy child.</p>


<h3>XXIX.</h3>

<p>The night advances. Already the
moon has commenced to decline.
Some of the invited ones have retired;
others, grouped here and there,
seated or half-extended, are sleeping
in the hot breath of the storm.
There are two powers that watch&mdash;Paganina
and the tempest, and the
thunder rolls and shakes the mountains.</p>

<p>Silent and isolated, Paganina looks
at the shadow of the Château Sarrasin.
She sees it advance and recede.
She thinks of the legend of this
cursed place&mdash;so fatal to the honor
of women. And yet fate has led her
there&mdash;the gulf is yawning for her.
She advances; she will enter never
there.</p>

<p>A cry is heard; the sleepers, wakened
suddenly, run to and fro, pale
and frightened. They find Paganina
fainting and covered with blood. A
deep wound is found in her throat.
The count sustains her, and in a voice
thundering above the tempest orders
his people to seize the assassin.</p>

<p>The assassin was André!</p>

<p>When they wished to carry the
wounded one into the Château Sarrasin,
she could not speak, but betrayed,
in signs of such mortal terror,
her repugnance to enter, that they
were obliged to relinquish the idea.</p>

<p>She said since, at the moment that
the doors opened to make way for her,
she again saw the scene which, several
years before, had so forcibly struck
her. Nothing was wanting; the
brightness of the light, or the luxury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of the dress. All the actors were
there, all&mdash;but they were hideous
skeletons; they still made gestures of
applause, while above them, the woman
with the green diamond showed
a livid face, the eyes extinct, and an
open mouth, from which no sound
proceeded.</p>

<p>Paganina was laid on a litter and
carried to Arèse.</p>

<p>André followed her, chained, and
guarded from sight. They arrived
next morning.</p>

<p>It is said the infuriated crowd
rushed upon the assassin and his
guard, and obliged them to fly for
their lives. Paganina had him
brought to her, took him by the
hand, and so passed through the
moved and disarmed assemblage.</p>


<h3>XXX.</h3>

<p>For a long time her life was despaired
of. A burning fever consumed
her. Her sufferings were such as
belonged to her thirsty nature. She
experienced the most terrible of earthly
tortures; and prayed in her delirium
for a stream of water to flow into
her parched lips.</p>

<p>Her moral sufferings were still
greater. Every evening she became
the prey to a terrible hallucination,
that she regarded as the punishment
of her wish for popularity; she saw
herself raised far above an immense
crowd, and this crowd becoming by
turns insulting and mocking. Its
waves of fury flowed and reflowed at
the feet of their victim, and covered
her with their froth. Paganina, in
despair, would have thrown herself
into this shoreless tide; but in vain;
she felt herself enchained to her
height, and obliged to wait for the
rays of morning to dissipate her
phantoms.</p>

<p>These two features suffice to characterize
her malady, which was moral
as well as physical. Its intensity
lasted during the winter months. In
the spring only she appeared to be
restored to health, but the blow had
been a severe one, and the rest of
her life was merely a prolonged convalescence.</p>


<h3>XXXI.</h3>

<p>But suffering in silence accomplished
its work. Her long confinement
had curbed if not wholly subdued
her ardent nature, and those who
thought to find the revived Paganina
on the declivity where they had left
her, were greatly mistaken.</p>

<p>Their surprise was greater, too, as
no indication had prepared them for
the change. The work in her soul
was well and firmly done, and she remained
calmly impenetrable to her
friends, until there escaped from her,
in spite of herself, a jet of revealing
flame.</p>

<p>The Count Ludovic had never
ceased his attentions during her illness.
His passion, far from weakening,
had grown stronger during his
separation. When he could be admitted
to her presence, he expressed
his sentiments, perhaps, too tenderly;
he who knew her, knew of what sudden
movements and prompt returns
she was capable, strove with all his
energy, but remained confounded.
Not without reason, for so Paganina
answered him:</p>

<p>"Since the day when I first heard
all you have just repeated to me, I
have stood on the borders of eternity.
New lights have been shed on all
things since then; do not be surprised
that my language is no longer the
same.</p>

<p>"It must be true that you place
yourself in very high and me in very
low esteem! Do you consider my
honor a worthy prey for your
vanity? Do you not think that a few
days of pleasure might be too well
paid for by my past and my future?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
What, then, do you wish? You ask
that I abjure the past, that I sacrifice
to you my whole future, and even
more! My immortal soul is what
you would wish to debase. And in
a few days you would give me, in
exchange, your contempt, to run,
freer and more honored than ever,
into new pleasures. This is what
you wish, and yet you say you love
me.</p>

<p>"Good God! what might I have
been to-day, if heaven had not arrested
me&mdash;and what am I now?</p>

<p>"Ah! forgive me; I have lost the
right to be severe. Words of blame
or bitterness should not come from
my lips. No, it is myself I despise;
and this contempt, to which I am consecrated,
plunges into my heart a
poisoned iron. It oppresses, it stifles
me, and leaves for my punishment
the life I hate.</p>

<p>"Count Ludovic, you are the son
of chevaliers. I know at the bottom
of your heart is the nobility of your
ancestors. Adieu; we have met for
the last time."</p>

<p>And the count, retiring on this
command, lost his reputation for a
man of gallantry.</p>


<h3>XXXII.</h3>

<p>It was Easter-Sunday, the feast of
eternal life. The sun shed through
the clouds its humid rays, the trees&mdash;clothed
in new verdure and brightly
agitated&mdash;sent forth their sweet and
subtle perfumes.</p>

<p>Paganina, still weak, was placed
by the open window; she turned
toward the church her eyes, grown
larger in suffering, and listened to the
notes of the feast, weakened by the
distance. When Faust heard such
songs the poisoned cup fell from his
hands. In his desperation he believed
no longer in God. The earth had
reclaimed him. Heaven was going
to reconquer Paganina.</p>

<p>The angels, approaching her,
brought back a world of innocent
and gentle memories; she wept.</p>

<p>At this moment the bells, pealing
their joyous notes, announced the
end of the ceremony.</p>

<p>The virgins, clothed in white, quitted
the church in silent swarms. Paganina
saw them pass before her in a
vision, for they appeared in groups of
such supernatural beauty that she
was thrown into an ecstasy.</p>

<p>She saw them leave the second
banquet&mdash;some retiring sweetly within
themselves, as slender stalks bending
under the weight of the heavenly
dew; others, pale, with foreheads high
and open, and eyes pure and ardent.
They crossed their arms on their
breasts, the better to guard their treasure.
All wore the trace of that fire
which for eighteen hundred years has
marked the victory of the virgins and
the martyrs. The ray of divine beauty
which fell on these figures was reflected
back on Paganina; her soul
was transfixed and vanquished for
ever.</p>

<p>She rose, and standing, pale as
her long white vestments, she prayed:</p>

<p>"Thou seekest me again, my God;
behold! I come. To thee I return,
and with the frightful experience of
the darkness of oblivion, and penetrated
with the horror of those places
where thou art not.</p>

<p>"Thou art witness that, before I
abandoned the heights where thou
residest, I sustained an infernal struggle.
That day my vision was lowered,
the dragon of the abyss mounted
toward me, to drag me to its depths....
Thy angels have fallen, my
God! But while they are lost for ever,
why, why am I reclaimed?</p>

<p>"I come trembling in thy light.
Do not reject thy victim; acknowledge
the blood-stain with which thou
hast marked me to save me, I hope;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
let me again contemplate thy eternal
beauty. Thy beauty, my Lord, I
must see. I thirst for it; one of its
bright rays has shone before me, and
the world has nothing more to offer.</p>

<p>"My last hour will be the hour of
my deliverance; I wait for it. Accept
the offering of a broken life,
whose failing forces will be employed
to repair the evil I have done. And
thou, my father, I bless thee, because
I may yet sleep again in thy bosom."</p>


<h3>XXXIII.</h3>

<p>The day fixed for the trial of André
having arrived, a great mass of people
pressed around the court of justice.
In the memory of man, no
celebrated cause had ever attracted
so great a multitude. At every hour,
the waves of the crowd mounted
higher and higher against the walls
of the palace. When it was known
that Paganina would appear to give
her testimony, such tumult and agitation
arose that the judges were obliged
to suspend proceedings. Calm being
somewhat reëstablished, the president
called Paganina to testify against the
assassin. Then, without raising her
eyes, in a low and trembling voice,
which ran shuddering through the
crowd, she answered, "He saved
my honor!" Twice she said it, and
when the president, renewing his interrogation,
menaced her with the penalties
of the law if she refused her
testimony, she fixed upon him a
steady gaze and repeated in a strong
voice,</p>

<p>"He saved my honor!"</p>

<p>At these words there was a shout
of enthusiasm. Men threw their caps
into the air, and cried, "Hurrah!"
Women wept and were agitated; and
André, sobbing aloud, held out to
her his trembling hands.</p>

<p>It is easily known he was acquitted.</p>


<h3>XXXIV.</h3>

<p>Soon after, a strange, unheard-of
rumor was afloat. They said the
Count Ludovic asked Paganina in
marriage. The Count Ludovic!
This flower of nobility, this last of an
antique chivalry, condescend to propose
to an actress, and tarnish his
escutcheon! It was not to be believed.
But the evidence was excellent.
He said so himself, and even
rudely, to the unlucky flatterers who
thought to make capital out of the
enormity of the story.</p>

<p>We can conceive the emotion was
great, and spread rapidly.</p>

<p>Things stood so, when two other
pieces of news, following closely on
this, caused it to be forgotten.</p>

<p>And these were, first, that the demand
of the Count Ludovic was not
acceded to; the second, that his preferred
rival was André, an obscure
musician with a weak brain; and,
even worse than that, that all his
merit rested in his attempt at the
assassination of the object of his passion.</p>

<p>I give the facts in their entire simplicity.
Truth is worth more than
its resemblance; so any extenuation,
any covering of phrases, would be
useless, and neither make them accepted
nor understood by practical
people&mdash;those who judge every thing
from their own stand-point, and name
it so well "common sense."</p>

<p>Paganina wished to repair the evil
of which she was the cause. She
found "at her hand" the sacrifice she
desired.</p>

<p>From the terrible night passed at
the Château Sarrasin, André had never
resumed the complete use of his
reason. To have the right to devote
herself to him, his cousin married
him; surrounded him with every
care, and watched over the flame of
his vacillating intelligence with a love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
more maternal than conjugal. In our
existence, many things are strange.
She never seemed the wife of André.
She lived with him as a sister. And
can you imagine what was her life,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> with an idiot? Calculate
the energy to sustain, and the patience
to calm him.</p>

<p>When the spectres of madness approached
the poor invalid, warned by
his cries of terror, Paganina ran to
him. Her presence, and the sound
of her voice, dispelled the phantoms.
Delivered from his terrors, he threw
himself at her feet, covered her hands
with kisses and tears, and invoked
her as his angel, swearing to her inviolable
obedience.</p>

<p>Since King David's time, we all
know the power of music to dispel
the spirits of darkness. Paganina
made use of it, and found consolation
in the mingled studies that brought
her cousin such relief. So even they
had hours of happiness.</p>

<p>The genius, too, of Paganina was
not entirely lost to her contemporaries.
She was heard once in Milan,
in a religious ceremony; and once
again in Germany, where she had
gone, nearly two years after her marriage,
to make, with André, a pilgrimage
to the house of her father.
For her it was the song of the swan,
for her exhausted and uncertain life
went out soon afterward.</p>

<p>This song of songs will reveal her
last thoughts and conclude her history.</p>


<h3>XXXV.</h3>

<p>In one of those festivals which are
the noble pleasure and the glory of
Germany, an oratorio was to be given
for the first time, the expectation of
which excited a passionate impatience.</p>

<p>This composition, called <i>The Angels'
Fall</i>, is due to a musician whose
name will descend to the latest posterity,
carried onward by the tempests
his genius has evoked.</p>

<p>The part of the archangel Lucifer
was awarded to Paganina. These
phlegmatic Germans, when they give
themselves to enthusiasm, lose all
bounds; and Paganina might have
been satisfied could she have known
her success; but her soul was elsewhere.</p>

<p>This oratorio was divided into
three parts. The first expressed heaven.
If there is any thing in this
world that can make man see what
his eyes cannot, and understand what
his ears have never heard, it is music;
for the true musician knows that
such harmony, quitting earth, mounts
to the vaults of paradise, where it
wakens the echoes that have nothing
of earth, and falls again on us&mdash;the
messenger of hope and consolation.</p>

<p>Paganina's <i>rôle</i>, in this part, was
less important than in that which followed.
Her voice was rarely detached
from the whole; but now and
then two or three dazzling notes
rose through the harmony, and the
transported auditors believed they
saw the fluttering wings of the archangel
already hovering on the eternal
heights.</p>

<p>I will say nothing of the second
part, although several found it superior
to the two others, on account of
the sombre energy, the terrible power
with which is rendered the insurrection
of the rebel angels.</p>

<p>Paganina should have been perfectly
at her ease, to display here the
richness of her voice&mdash;this voice
which, in other parts, rang as a trumpet
of gold and brass. But these accents
of revolt choked her, and here
she was unequal. She would soon
surpass herself in the last air.</p>

<p>The composer, by one of those
happy mistakes from which the best
works grow, forgot the tradition. His
angels were not thunder-struck in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
their pride, and shrieking in blasphemy;
but vanquished. They were
condemned, and wept. They weep
for the heaven they have lost. Admiration
believed there was nothing
more to expect; but here the master
recalls his power, reanimates his genius,
and finds an inspiration supreme
to chant the farewell to infinite happiness
of the guilty phalanx.</p>

<p>The sobs of the orchestra and chorus
are heard alternately, and the
voice of the archangel rises once
again. At this moment, Paganina
sang her last air on earth with an
intensity of love and grief that cannot
be described.</p>

<p>No, Paganina! one who can so
weep has not lost heaven.</p>

<p>Those who saw her then will never
forget her. In this high-vaulted
room, lofty as a church, she stood
above the others, in a long black robe
covered with stars. Her beauty was
that of an archangel.</p>

<p>As she finished, a ray of sunlight,
streaming through the red glass, and
sparkling as the flaming sword that
forbade the entrance into Eden, rested
a moment at her feet and expired.</p>

<h2>THE COUNCIL OF TRENT.</h2>


<p>Now that the attention of the Catholic
world is directed to the coming
Ecumenical Council, and various
questions are asked about the nature
and the probable effects of such a
meeting, one's eyes naturally turn to
the latest general synod of the church.
The history of the Council of Trent
is, indeed, of great interest. "Than
it," says its accomplished historian,
Pallavicini, "no preceding council
was more distinguished for length of
duration, for the definition of important
dogmas, for the efficient reformation
of manners and laws; none hindered
by greater obstacles, none more patient
and accurate in discussion, none
more highly praised by friends, or more
bitterly censured by opponents."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> A
review of the history of this great
council, its work, and its results, will
not be out of place, at this time and
in these pages.</p>

<p>The so-called Reformation was different
from any other heresy that had
attacked the church of God in this,
that it impugned the vital principle
of church authority. Other heresiarchs
had denied one or another dogma;
Luther and his followers denied
the existence of any authority to define
dogmas. Other schismatists had
rebelled against the governing power,
but, even in their rebellion, had admitted
its existence, though they
might wish to curtail its powers, or to
dispute its legitimate possession; the
reformers declared that there was no
external authority appointed of God
to govern the spiritual affairs of men.
"The combat," says D'Aubigné,
"was to be to the death. It was
not the abuses of the pontiff's authority
Luther had attacked. At his bidding,
the pope was required to descend
meekly from his throne, and
become again a simple pastor or
bishop on the banks of the Tiber."
And his pastoral or episcopal charge
was not to be recognized as delegated
from God, but given to him by
the consent of the faithful. Real
church authority was utterly denied;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
it was not its exercise, but its very
existence that was brought into question.
As Dr. Ewer puts it, "This was
the meanest mode of attack" to Christianity.
"Protestantism made an ally
of the Bible, and with it flew at the
church to destroy her. Satan ...
picked his men.... Protestantism, making
an ally of the Bible, succeeded
not in reforming the church, but in
attacking and destroying her in many
lands."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Against such a rebellion
the church had to put on her strongest
armor. No mere outworks were
attacked; the strongest citadel, the
key to the whole position, was the
object of deadly assault. The lines
of attack were twofold. It was said
that the church, under the guidance
of the pontiffs of Rome, had fallen
away from the true faith, and proposed
superstitious errors and mere human
inventions to the belief of her
children. It was furthermore charged
that she had become horribly deformed
in morals, a very sink of iniquity,
instead of that spotless and stainless
bride whom Christ had laved in his
blood. The intricate and difficult
questions of original sin, its nature, its
effects, its remedy&mdash;the justification
of the sinner&mdash;were again opened
and discussed with force and acrimony,
if not with discretion and candor.
The whole sacramental system was
practically denied; the altar and the
priesthood removed; and the church,
as it is seen by the eyes of men, reduced
to a mere voluntary association
of believers, for which indefectibility,
infallibility, or authority could
not by any means be claimed. The
Bible was appealed to in support of
these novel statements, and to each
one's private judgment was generously
granted the privilege of securely
interpreting the sacred page. The
new doctrine flattered the vanity of
the human intellect; and there were
found many not unwilling to sit as
judges where they had before stood as
hearers; to leave the humble bench
of the scholar for the magisterial
chair of the religious teacher. The
constant attacks on real or pretended
abuses added greatly to the temporary
success of the reformers. Against
these (to borrow an expression from
Hallam) "Luther bellowed in bad
Latin." That there was much to be
reformed, the numerous decrees of
the Council of Trent leave us no
room to doubt. It is also clear that
it would have been well for the
church had prompter remedies taken
away in advance the specious pretext
of the turbulent Augustinian. But it
pleased her Divine Head to permit
that the wrong should continue to
thrive, and, when the time of trial came,
many gave as an excuse for their falling
off, the scandals which they alleged
could no longer be endured.
A glance at the history of the times
will, however, show how flimsy was
such a pretext. The scandals of the
lives of the seceders and their immediate
followers contrast darkly with
the honest reforms of Trent, and the
dissoluteness which was the immediate
result of the revolution, taken
in connection with the acknowledged
improvement inside of the church,
would lead one to suppose that the
authors and abettors of the real abuses
had abandoned the ancient fold,
and betaken themselves to freer and
more congenial pastures. Of his
own party, Luther, as quoted by Döllinger,
said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Our evangelicals are now sevenfold
more wicked than they were before. In
proportion as we hear the Gospel, we steal,
lie, cheat, gorge, swill, and commit every
crime. If one devil has been driven out of
us, seven worse ones have taken their place,
to judge from the conduct of princes, lords,
nobles, burgesses, and peasants, their utterly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
shameless acts, and their disregard of
God and of his menaces."</p></blockquote>

<p>Of the old church, Henry Hallam
says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The decrees of the Council of Trent
were received by the spiritual princes of
the empire in 1566, 'and from this moment,'
says the excellent historian who has thrown
most light on this subject, 'began a new life
for the Catholic Church in Germany.'...
Every method was adopted to revive an attachment
to the ancient religion, insuperable
by the love of novelty or the force of argument.
A stricter discipline and subordination
was introduced among the clergy;
they were early trained in seminaries, apart
from the sentiments and habits, the vices
and the virtues of the world. The monastic
orders resumed their rigid observances."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Luther, anticipating his condemnation
by Pope Leo X., appealed in
1518 to a general council, a course,
we may remark, frequently taken by
heretics, if for nothing else, at least
to gain time to enroll followers, and
thus increase in importance, before
the final condemnation. The diet of
Nuremberg, in 1522, in answer to the
conciliatory and truly apostolic communication
of Pope Adrian VI.,
through his nuncio, Cheregat, requested
his holiness to call a council in
some city of Germany, with the
double object of a thorough reformation,
and of devising means of resistance
to the menacing advances of
the Turkish power. Adrian died before
he could take any action on the
subject, and the new pontiff, Clement
VII., did not receive the proposal
with favor. According to Pallavicini,
he feared that under the actual circumstances
the council would only
aggravate the evil, especially if the
fathers should revive the pretensions of
their predecessors of Constance and
Basle, an apprehension very prevalent
at that time at Rome, and, it must be
admitted, not altogether groundless;
besides, the war then raging between
Charles V. and Francis I., from
whose dominions most of the bishops
were to come, rendered the possibility
of a successful convocation almost
hopeless; and, lastly, the demand
was for a council which would satisfy
Luther and his party; namely, one in
which any one that might choose,
even laymen, should be allowed to
take part, and the pontiff should lay
aside his high prerogatives, and sit as
a simple bishop. He consequently
instructed his legate, Campeggi, that
it was impossible to call a council until
the conclusion of peace between
the two great princes of Europe, offering,
at the same time, to carry
out the measures of reform decreed
by the council of Lateran, held not
long before by Leo X., and to provide
by his own authority proper remedies
on other points. The unfortunate war
in which Clement became afterward
involved with Charles V. delayed for
some time all question of holding a
council; but, with the return of peace,
the negotiations were resumed, and
at a consultation held in Bologna, in
1533, between the pontiff and the
emperor, the former agreed to convoke
the council within six months
from the acceptation of certain very
equitable conditions by all interested.
But the Protestant princes of Germany,
in a meeting at Smalcald, (1533,)
refused to accept the two first conditions,
"that the council should be
free, and be held after the manner of
the ancient general councils; and
that those who wished to take part
in it should promise beforehand to
obey its decrees;" a refusal which
justified, in part at least, the fears of
the pontiff. He did not, however,
desist, and was engaged in negotiations
on the subject until his death,
(September 25th, 1534.) His successor,
Paul III., had never shared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
his fears, and, soon after his elevation,
sent nuncios to the various princes to
promote the speedy convocation of
the council. In point of fact, he did
convoke it, appointing Mantua, which
had been agreed on by the emperor
and the Catholic princes of Germany,
as the place, and the 23d day of
May, 1537, as the time, of the meeting.
It is useless minutely to detail
the obstacles placed in the way of
the great event by the Duke of Mantua
and others, the selection of Vicenza,
the suspension of the council,
and the bootless legation of Contarini
to the diet of Ratisbon. At last,
as the pontiff himself says, in his bull
of convocation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"While we awaited the hidden time, the
time of thy good pleasure, O God! we were
compelled to say that when we take counsel
concerning things sacred, and pertaining to
Christian piety, every time is pleasing to
God. Wherefore, seeing, to our great
sorrow, that the condition of Christendom
was every day becoming worse, Hungary oppressed
by the Turks, the Germans themselves
in danger, and all the rest of Europe
seized with fear and sadness&mdash;we determined
no longer to wait on the consent of any
prince, but to regard solely the will of
Almighty God and the good of the Christian
commonwealth."</p></blockquote>

<p>To satisfy the Germans, he selected
Trent as the place of meeting, though
he himself would have preferred
some city of Italy nearer Rome. But
new obstacles arose, and the council,
though convoked for the feast of All
Saints, (November 1st, 1542,) was
not opened until December 13th,
1545. Even then, it was necessary
to commence with a very small attendance
of prelates. At the first
session there were present, besides
the legates of the apostolic see and
the Cardinal Bishop of Trent, only
four archbishops, twenty bishops, and
five general superiors of religious
orders.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
But it was thought better
to make a beginning, even though
the number of fathers was lamentably
small, especially since, according to
ancient ecclesiastical usage, a council,
legitimately convoked by the apostolic
see, legitimately celebrated under
its presidency, and approved by its
authority, is ecumenical, even though
many of the bishops called to it were
either unable or unwilling to take
part in its deliberations.</p>

<p>Bishops in greater number gradually
found their way to the assembly,
and seven sessions were held in succession,
the last on March 3d, 1547,
so that the deliberations of this period
of the council lasted over fourteen
months. The work of reformation was
commenced, together with the dogmatical
definitions, and the same plan was
followed throughout. On March 11th,
the eighth session was held; but the
only business transacted was the
passing of a decree transferring the
council to Bologna, the reason assigned
being an epidemic, the existence
of which in Trent was declared to be
a matter of notoriety, and which had
already caused some prelates to leave
that city, others to protest against a
further sojourn. Many fathers obeyed
the decree, and the congregations
were held regularly in Bologna. The
Emperor Charles V. did not, however,
relish this transfer from a city of his
dominions to one under the temporal
jurisdiction of the pope, and he detained
at Trent the prelates from his
states. The result was that, after two
formal sessions, the synod was prorogued,
"at the pleasure of the Sacred
Council," on September 14th, 1547,
and the remainder of the pontificate
of Paul III. was spent in fruitless negotiations
for its resumption. Paul
died on November 10th, 1549, of
whom Pallavicini says: "By his inordinate
affection for his family, he
showed himself to be only a man;
for the rest, he has deserved in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
church the name of hero."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
His successor
was Julius III., who as Cardinal
del Monte had presided over the
council in the quality of first legate
apostolic. His first care was to
reopen the sacred synod, and he immediately
sent nuncios to the emperor
and the French king, to bring
about this desired result. The stand
taken by Charles for Trent made it
advisable again to select that city, and
Julius was enabled, on December 1st,
1550, to publish a bull appointing
the first day of May of the ensuing
year for the reassembling of the council.
The first session (eleventh of the
whole series) was accordingly held on
that day, but, to give time to the
Germans to arrive, no business was
transacted, September 1st being appointed
for the next session. Meanwhile,
the preparatory work went on,
and on the appointed day, the archbishop,
electors of Mayence and
Treves, and many other prelates being
present, another session was held, in
which it was determined to wait until
October 11th, for other bishops of Germany
and other nations, who were
known to be on their way. The thirteenth
session was celebrated on this
day, and it was followed by three others,
in all of which important canons and
decrees were passed. But civil war
had broken out in Germany, and
Maurice of Saxony, at the head of a
Protestant army, in league with the
French king, had occupied Augsburg
and menaced Innspruch, where
Charles held his court, and whence
he soon afterward retired. It was
not to be wondered at that the
fathers in the neighboring city of
Trent should wish to shun a danger
before which even the great emperor
was obliged to retreat, and, in the
sixteenth session, held on April 28th,
1552, a decree was passed suspending
the celebration of the council for two
years, providing, however, that in case
of a speedy return of peace it might
be resumed sooner. Pressed by his
enemies, Charles agreed to the pacification
of Passau, which promulgated
a kind of toleration of both the old
and the new religion. It also provided
for a diet of the empire, in
which the question was to be discussed
whether an ecumenical council,
or a national synod, or a conference,
or an imperial diet, afforded the
surest method of settling the existing
religious differences. This, of course,
put off the council again. Meanwhile,
Julius III. died on March 23d, 1555.
His former colleague in the apostolic
legation to the council under Paul
III., Cardinal Cervini, succeeded him
in the pontificate; but death summoned
him on the twenty-second day of his
reign. The austere, zealous, but by
no means prudent Cardinal Caraffa
was the next choice of the Sacred
College. The career of Paul IV.
affords a singular example of the fallacy
of human expectations. Before his
election, he was a subject of the
emperor, (he was a Neapolitan by
birth;) in the pontificate, he waged
war against Charles, son and successor;
himself pure and above all suspicion,
his reign was disgraced by the
worst form of nepotism, so that, under
his successor, his nephews, one of
them a cardinal, died the death of
malefactors; a great and really zealous
promoter of reform, he took no
steps to reassemble the council. Nor
indeed could he. He was for the
greater part of his reign at war with
Philip II., successor of Charles V., in
the latter's hereditary dominions, and
he would never recognize Ferdinand
as Charles's legitimate successor in the
empire, on account of the part taken
by that prince in the pacification of
Passau. Yet so opposed was he to
heresy, that he had recalled from England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the gentle and prudent Cardinal
Pole, and was about to summon him
to Rome to purge himself of the suspicion
of heresy, and he actually imprisoned,
on a similar suspicion, Cardinal
Morone, who was destined to be
the moving spirit, as he was the actual
president of the last sessions of the
great council. Paul died on August
18th, 1559. He was an excellent
ecclesiastic, conspicuous for learning
and virtue, and in less troubled times
would have been a successful, as he
was a holy pontiff. But, to quote
Pallavicini, "he was braver in punishing
crime, no matter how high the
criminal, than prudent in preventing
it. He took the amplitude of his
sacred power as the proper measure
of its exercise."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
He waged war,
however, on abuses, and was a severe
ecclesiastical disciplinarian. His
whole pontificate is a proof of the
uselessness, not to say positive evil,
in persons in high position, of determination,
zeal, vigor, unless tempered
by discretion, prudence, and meekness.
His successor, Cardinal Medici,
who took the name of Pius IV.,
a learned and virtuous prelate, though
not so remarkable for natural parts
or austere asceticism, accomplished
much more for the glory of God and
the good of Holy Church.</p>

<p>The new pontiff immediately turned
his attention to the council. He
had three princes of first class to deal
with&mdash;the Emperor Ferdinand, and
the kings of France and Spain. This
last and the emperor desired the
council to be reassembled at Trent;
but the French sovereign objected
to this place on account of its
want of accommodations and unhealthy
air, but especially because the
Protestants had already commenced
to hate the name, and proposed Constance.
But at last the pontiff obtained
the unanimous consent of all
the Catholic princes of Europe for
Trent, and on November 29th, 1560,
issued a bull appointing Easter Sunday
of the coming year for the reopening
of the council. He sent his
legates to Trent, and many prelates
soon arrived; the congregations and
other preparatory meetings were held;
but the troubles in France, on the
succession of Charles IX., prevented
the arrival of the French bishops.
At last, on January 18th, 1562, was
held, with unusual solemnity, the first
session under Pius IV., (seventeenth
of the whole series,) at which there
were present, besides the apostolic
legates and the Cardinal of Trent,
one hundred and six bishops, four
mitred abbots, and four generals of
religious orders. From this happy
day, the council went on with its appointed
work without any interference.
There were grave discussions,
sometimes warm and prolonged, but
always ending in peace and harmony.
The French bishops arrived, before
the end of the year, under the leadership
of the illustrious Charles of
Guise, Cardinal of Lorraine. At last,
to use the words of Jerome Ragazzoni,
Bishop of Nazianzen, and coadjutor
of Famagosta, orator at the last
session, "the day arrived which
Paul III. and Julius III. had
yearned for, but which it was not
given to them to see&mdash;a gladness reserved
to Pius IV.&mdash;on which the
Council of Trent, commenced long
before, often interrupted, and sometimes
transferred, was at last, thanks
to God's great mercy, happily ended,
to the great and unspeakable joy of
all classes of men." The twenty-fifth
and last session was held on December
3d and 4th, 1563. There were
present at it four cardinal legates of
the apostolic see, two other cardinals,
those of Trent and Lorraine, three
patriarchs, twenty-five archbishops,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
one hundred and sixty-eight bishops,
thirty-nine procurators of prelates
legitimately absent, seven abbots,
and seven generals of religious
orders&mdash;making, in all, two hundred
and fifty-five prelates, whose signatures
are attached to the decrees.
Amid the festive acclamations, composed
and intoned by the Cardinal of
Lorraine, tears of joy testified the
gladness of all hearts; opponents
embraced one another, no longer
rivals, but brethren; the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te Deum</i>
was sung with feelings of the deepest
gratitude; and as the first legate,
Morone, having given his solemn
blessing to the fathers, bade them, in
the name of the supreme pontiff, go
in peace, the last solemn act of the
great council was performed. The
whole time, from the first session
under Paul III. to the last under
Pius IV., was within a few days of
eighteen years; but that actually
occupied by the council was four
years and about eight months. The
canons and decrees, both in faith and
discipline, were solemnly approved,
at the request of the fathers, by "the
most blessed Roman pontiff," Pius
IV., as the council styled him, on
January 25th, 1564; and, by a subsequent
bull, they were declared obligatory
on the whole church, from the
first day of May of the same year.</p>

<p>This historical sketch will serve to
give some idea of the difficulties the
work of the council had to encounter.
Whatever may be said in the abstract
of the union of church and state, their
relations in the sixteenth century
were very unsatisfactory. Popes
Paul III., Julius, and Pius wanted a
general council; but it was very difficult
so to arrange matters as to obtain
the necessary consent of all the Catholic
powers, and this difficulty always
afforded an excuse for delay when
delay was really desired. Then there
were courtiers at Rome "to whose
ears the word reform sounded harsh,"
as Pallavicini says; and who were
suddenly animated by the most
ardent zeal in defence of the prerogatives
of the holy see, which, they
alleged, would be unduly curtailed
by the council. But the firmness of
the pontiffs, under the grace of God,
which never abandons his church,
brought these machinations to
nought. They refused to interfere to
save their dependents from a thorough
reform; and Pius IV., especially,
declared that he left full liberty
to the fathers in the matter. And in
a discourse in the Consistory of Cardinals,
on December 30th, 1563, he
expressly thanked the fathers "for
the religious zeal and resolute freedom
with which they had spared no
labor, no care, to remove all heresies
and corruptions." "We are also," he
continued, "not a little indebted to
them for having been so moderate
and indulgent in the work of reformation,
in regard to our own affairs, (that
is, the papal court,) that, had we preferred
to take this duty on ourselves,
and not commit it to their discretion,
we should certainly have been more
severe. Wherefore, as salutary measures
have been adopted, it is our
firm determination forthwith to carry
the reform into effect by the observance
of the decrees of the sacred
synod. We shall rather, when necessary,
make up by our own diligence
for the moderation and leniency of
the fathers; so far are we from wishing
to neglect or diminish one iota."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
And he appointed Cardinals Morone
and Simonetta, both legates to the
council, to see that nothing was done
by any of the papal officials in contravention
of the so lately approved
decrees. The courtiers had to submit,
and the court of Rome since
that day has given little or no occasion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
for serious complaint, and certainly
no pretext for a schism under
the name of reform. Another difficulty
arose from the multitude of
counsellors, and the liberty left in discussion.
Now that the council has
passed into history, it is pleasant to
see that such ample freedom was
allowed; but it must have been
sometimes a sore task for the legates
to keep order. They well deserved
the encomium of Ragazzoni, "You
have been our excellent leaders and
directors in action. You have used
incredible patience and diligence in
guarding against any violation of our
liberty, either in speaking or in legislating.
You have spared no bodily
labor, no mental exertion, to bring
the undertaking to its desired end."
But the principal difficulty arose from
the Protestants themselves. They
had asked for the council, but when
it was assembled they would have
nothing to do with it. Three different
safe conducts were issued for
them&mdash;one under Paul III., another
under Julius III., and the last under
Pius IV.&mdash;all of them as ample as
could be desired; but to no purpose.
They did not really want a council,
but an ecclesiastical mob without a
head; in other words, they wanted
the main question of church authority
to be decided in advance in their
favor. Their course was substantially
that of all former heretics; first, to
appeal to the council, to gain time
and cause trouble; then, after their
condemnation, to abuse the council
as much as they had formerly abused
the pope. It would be difficult to
determine which is to-day the greater
bugbear of the average Protestant,
the Council of Trent or the holy see.</p>

<p>Few, if any, assemblages have received
such praise for learning, moderation,
and zeal&mdash;not only from
friends, but from candid opponents&mdash;as
that of Trent. We will give as a
sample the judgment of Hallam, himself
not at all well disposed toward
Catholic dogma. His testimony is
the more valuable that he acknowledges
to have taken his facts from
the disingenuous account of the more
than half Protestant, Fra Paolo Sarpi,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
and never to have read the able and
exhaustive history of Pallavicini:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is usual for Protestant writers to inveigh
against the Tridentine fathers. I do
not assent to their decisions, which is not to
the purpose, nor vindicate the intrigues of
the papal party. But I must presume to say
that, reading their proceedings in the pages
of that very able and not very lenient historian
to whom we have generally recourse,
an adversary as decided as any that could
have come from the reformed churches, I
find proofs of much ability, considering the
embarrassments with which they had to
struggle, and of an honest desire of reformation,
among a large body, as to those
matters which, in their judgment, ought to
be reformed."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Again:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It will appear, by reading the accounts
of the sessions of the council, either in
Father Paul, or in any more favorable historian,
that, even in certain points, such as
justification, which had not been clearly laid
down before, the Tridentine decrees were
mostly conformable with the sense of the majority
of those doctors who had obtained the
highest reputation; and that upon what are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
more usually reckoned the distinctive characteristics
of the Church of Rome, namely,
transubstantiation, purgatory, and invocation
of the saints and the Virgin, they assert
nothing but what had been so engrafted into
the faith of this part of Europe as to have
been rejected by no one without suspicion
or imputation of heresy. Perhaps Erasmus
would not have acquiesced with good-will
in <em>all</em> the decrees of the council; but was
Erasmus deemed orthodox?... No general
council ever contained so many persons
of eminent learning and ability as that of
Trent; nor is there ground for believing
that any other ever investigated the questions
before it with so much patience, acuteness,
temper, and desire of truth. The
early councils, unless they are greatly belied,
would not bear comparison in these characteristics.
Impartiality and freedom from
prejudice, no Protestant will attribute to the
fathers of Trent; but where will he produce
these qualities in an ecclesiastical synod?
But it may be said that they had only one
leading prejudice, that of determining theological
faith according to the tradition of
the Catholic Church, as handed down to
their age. This one point of authority conceded,
I am not aware that they can be
proved to have decided wrong, or at least
against all reasonable evidence. Let those
who have imbibed a different opinion ask
themselves whether they have read Sarpi
through with any attention, especially as to
those sessions of the Tridentine Council
which preceded its suspension in 1549."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>To the praise of ability, industry,
and fairness, all of the highest order
from a natural point of view, Hallam
unconsciously adds a still greater, in
the eyes of any true Catholic, namely,
that the council, on controverted dogmatic
points, adhered to the tradition
of the Catholic Church. And this on
the authority of the carping Sarpi!
What more could the greatest admirer
say? Right in its view of
dogma from the traditional&mdash;the true
Catholic&mdash;stand-point, honest and unswerving
in reforming abuses, patient
in discussion, diligent in research, calm
in decision&mdash;such is the substantial
verdict of a Protestant writer, in the
nineteenth century, on the great council
of the sixteenth.</p>

<p>If we consider the variety of matters
treated of in the council, its work
will appear immense. The following
accurate synopsis is taken from the
oration of Ragazzoni, at the last session,
which we have quoted before.
In matters of faith, after the adoption
of the venerable creed sanctioned by
antiquity, the council drew up a catalogue
of the inspired books of the Old
and New Testament, and approved
the old received Latin version of the
Hebrew and Greek originals. It then
passed to decide the questions that
had been raised concerning the fall
of man. Next, with admirable wisdom
and order, it laid down the true
Catholic doctrine on justification. The
sacraments then claimed attention, and
their number, their life-giving power
through grace, and the nature of each
one were accurately defined. The
great dogma of the blessed eucharist
was fully laid down; the real dignity
of the Christian altar and sacrifice
was vindicated; and the moot question
of communion under one or two
kinds settled both in theory and
practice. Lastly, the false accusations
of opponents were dispelled, and
Catholic consciences gladdened by
the enunciations on indulgences, purgatory,
the invocation and veneration
of saints, and the respect to be paid
to their relics and images. The decision
on so many important and difficult
questions was no light task, and
of the utmost importance. A "hard
and fast line" was drawn between
heresy and truth; and if the wayward
were not all converted, the little ones
of Christ were saved from the danger
of being led astray. In her greatest
trial, the church gave no uncertain
sound. Nations might rage, and the
rulers of the earth meditate rash
things; but the truth of God did not
abandon her, and she fearlessly proclaimed
it in her council. In regard
to some abuses in practical matters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
dependent on dogma, from which the
innovators had seized a pretext to impugn
the true faith, a thorough reform
was decreed. Measures were taken
to prevent any impropriety or irreverence
in the celebration of the divine
sacrifice, whether from superstitious
observances, greed of filthy
lucre, unworthy celebrants, profane
places, or worldly concomitants.
The different orders of ecclesiastics
were accurately distinguished,
and the exclusive rights and duties of
each one clearly defined; some impediments
of matrimony, which had been
productive of evil rather than good,
were removed, and most stringent
regulations adopted to prevent the
crying wrongs to which confiding
innocence and virtue had been subjected
under the pretext of clandestine
marriages. All the abuses connected
with indulgences, the veneration
of the saints, and intercession for
the souls of purgatory, were fully and
finally extirpated. Nor was less care
taken in regard to purely disciplinary
matters. Measures were taken to insure,
as far at least as human frailty
would permit, the elevation of only
worthy persons to ecclesiastical dignities;
and stated times were appointed
for the frequent and efficient
preaching of the word of God, too
much hitherto neglected, the necessity
of which was insisted on with earnestness
and practical force. The sacred
duty of residence among their flocks
was impressed on bishops and all inferiors
having the care of souls; proper
provision was made for the support
of needy clergymen, and all privileges
which might protect heresy
or crime were swept away. To prevent
all suspicion of avarice in the
house of God, the gratuitous administration
of the sacraments was made
compulsory; and measures were taken
to put an effectual stop to the career of
the questor, by abolishing the office.
Young men destined for the priesthood
were to be trained in ecclesiastical
seminaries; provincial synods were
restored, and regular diocesan visitations
ordered; many new and extended
faculties were granted to the local
authorities, for the sake of better order
and prompter decision; the sacred
duty of hospitality was inculcated
in all clerics; wise regulations
were passed to secure proper promotions
to ecclesiastical benefices;
all hereditary possession of God's
sanctuary prohibited; moderation
prescribed in the use of the power of
excommunication; luxury, cupidity,
and license, as far as possible, exiled
from the sanctuary; most holy and
wise provisions adopted for the better
regulation of the religious of both
sexes, who were judiciously shorn of
many of their privileges, to the proper
development of episcopal authority;
the great ones of the world were
warned of their duties and responsibilities.
These, and many other similar
measures, were the salutary, efficient,
and lasting reforms with which God,
at last taking mercy on his people, inspired
the fathers of Trent, legitimately
congregated under the presidency and
guidance of the apostolic see. Such
was the great work done by the council&mdash;so
great that even this summary
review makes our wonder at the length
of its duration cease. One remark
seems worthy of special notice. The
usual complaint of Protestants against
the council was, and is, that it was too
much under papal influence. Now,
one of the most notable features of
its legislation is the great increase of
the power of bishops. Not only was
their <em>ordinary</em> authority confirmed
and extended, but they were made in
many cases, some of them of no little
importance, perpetual delegates of the
apostolic see, so that Philip II. of
Spain is reported to have said of his
bishops, that "they went to Trent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
as parish priests, and returned like so
many popes."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
So groundless is the
statement that the papal jealousy of
episcopal power prevented any really
salutary reforms.</p>

<p>Such was the great work of the
Council of Trent. But a tree is best
judged by its fruits, and this test will
give us even a better idea of its importance
and magnitude. Perhaps
the best encomium of the council is
that the Catholic of to-day reads with
astonishment of abuses and measures
of reform in the sixteenth century.
The prophecy of Ragazzoni, in his
often-quoted oration, has been literally
fulfilled&mdash;the names of many of
the evils of that period have been
forgotten. Thank God! to understand
the work of Trent, we have to
study the internal troubles of the
church of those days in the pages of
history, for we do not find them in
our own time. They have utterly
disappeared. We have already quoted
Hallam on the revival of faith
and piety in the church that was the
immediate effect of the council. All
historians agree that the triumphs of
Protestantism closed with the first
fifty years of its existence. After
that it gradually declined. "We
see," says Macaulay in his famous
<cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> article on the
papacy, "that during two hundred
and fifty years Protestantism has
made no conquests worth speaking
of. Nay, we believe that as far as
there has been a change, that change
has been in favor of the Church of
Rome." Hallam has noticed the
same fact, and assigned its real
causes; we shall give his words, as,
with a few obvious exceptions, they
might have been written by a Catholic:
"The prodigious increase of the
Protestant party in Europe, after the
middle of the (sixteenth) century, did
not continue more than a few years.
It was checked and fell back, not
quite so rapidly or completely as it
came on, but so as to leave the antagonist
church in perfect security."
He goes on to give the causes of the
reaction. The influence of the Council
of Trent in its reform of the clergy,
both secular and regular, (we have
already given his words,) is mentioned
as the principal cause; and, "far
above all the rest," he says, "the
Jesuits were the instruments of regaining
France and Germany to the
church they served." "They conquered
us," says Ranke, "on our own
ground, in our own homes, and stripped
us of a part of our country."
The following passages will give some
idea of the extent and causes of the
change:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Protestantism, as late as 1578, might
be deemed preponderant in all the Austrian
dominions, except the Tyrol. In the Polish
diets, the dissidents, as they were called,
met their opponents with vigor and success.
The ecclesiastical principalities were
full of Protestants; and even in the chapters
some of them might be found. But
the contention was unequal, from the different
characters of the parties; religious zeal
and devotion, which, fifty years before, had
overthrown the ancient rites in northern
Germany, were now more invigorating sentiments
in those who rescued them from
further innovation. In religious struggles,
where there is any thing like an equality of
forces, the question soon comes to be, which
party will make the greatest sacrifice for its
own faith? And, while the Catholic self-devotion
had grown far stronger, there was
much more secular cupidity, lukewarmness,
and formality in the Lutheran Church. In
a very few years the effects of this were
distinctly seen. The Protestants of the
Catholic principalities went back into the
bosom of Rome. In the bishopric of
Wurtzburg alone, sixty-two thousand converts
are said to have been received in the
year 1586. The Emperor Rodolph and his
brother archdukes, by a long series of persecution
and banishment, finally, though
not within this century, almost outrooted
Protestantism from the hereditary provinces
of Austria. It is true that these violent
measures were the proximate cause of so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
many conversions; but if the reformed had
been ardent and united, they were much too
strong to be thus subdued. In Bohemia,
accordingly, and in Hungary, where there
was a more steady spirit, they kept their
ground. The reaction was not less conspicuous
in other countries. It is asserted that
the Huguenots had already lost more than
two thirds of their number in 1580;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
comparatively,
I presume, with twenty years before;
and the change in their relative position
is manifest from all the histories of this
period. In the Netherlands, though the
seven united provinces were slowly winning
their civil and religious liberties at the
sword's point, yet West Flanders, once in
great measure Protestant, became Catholic
before the end of the century; while the
Walloon provinces were kept from swerving
by some bishops of great eloquence and
excellent lives, as well as by the influence
of the Jesuits planted at St. Omer and
Douay. At the close of this period of fifty
years, the mischief done to the old church
in its first decennium was very nearly repaired;
the proportion of the two religions
in Germany coincided with those which had
existed at the pacification of Passau. The
Jesuits, however, had begun to encroach a
little on the proper domain of the Lutheran
church.</p>

<p>"This great revival of the papal religion,
after the shock it had sustained in the first
part of the sixteenth century, ought for ever
to restrain that temerity of prediction so
frequent in our ears.... In the year
1560, every Protestant in Europe doubtless
anticipated the overthrow of popery; the
Catholics could have found little else to
warrant hope than their trust in heaven.
The late rush of many nations toward democratical
opinions has not been so rapid
and so general as the change of religion
about that period. It is important and interesting
to inquire what stemmed this current.
We readily acknowledge the prudence,
firmness, and unity of purpose that
for the most part distinguished the court of
Rome, the obedience of its hierarchy, the
severity of intolerant laws, and the searching
rigor of the Inquisition, the resolute
adherence of great princes to the Catholic
faith, the influence of the Jesuits over education;
but these either existed before, or
would at least not have been sufficient to
withstand an overwhelming force of opinion.
It must be acknowledged that there was a
principle of vitality in that religion, independent
of its external strength. By the
side of its secular pomp, its relaxation of
morality, there had always been an intense
flame of zeal and devotion. Superstition,
it might be, in the many, fanaticism in
a few; but both of these imply the qualities
which, while they subsist, render a religion
indestructible. That revival of an ardent
zeal, through which the Franciscans
had, in the thirteenth century, with some
good and much more evil effect, spread a
popular enthusiasm over Europe, was once
more displayed in counteraction of those
new doctrines that themselves had drawn
their life from a similar development of
moral emotion."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In the Council of Trent were again
fulfilled the words of the prophet
concerning the Messiah: "Behold,
he cometh ... like a refining fire, and
like the fuller's herb; and he shall sit
refining and cleansing the silver: and
he shall purify the sons of Levi, and
shall refine them as gold, and as silver;
and they shall offer sacrifices to
the Lord in justice; and the sacrifice
shall please the Lord, as in the
days of old, and in the ancient
years."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>The zeal of the fathers did not, it
is true, succeed in bringing back all
the Protestants; but neither did the
Council of Nice succeed with the
Arians, or that of Ephesus with the
Nestorians, or that of Chalcedon
with the followers of Eutyches. But
they kept the Catholic faith pure;
they sternly applied the pruning-hook
to the numerous excrescences which
had been allowed to accumulate.
God blessed their work; and the tree
of life, planted by running waters,
again produced new flowers and
fruits of holiness.</p>

<p>Though from the moment the decrees
were solemnly approved by the
holy see, with the exception of that
on clandestine marriages, for which
special provision had been made,
they commenced to be obligatory on
the whole church; yet it was thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
well to obtain a special promulgation
in the different Catholic countries of
Europe. The republic of Venice
and the king of Portugal first gave
the example; Philip II. of Spain followed,
and was imitated, after some
little delay in the hope of reconciling
the Protestants, by the German emperor.
France, then governed by
Catharine of Medici, alone, of Catholic
countries, refused. The excuse
given was, principally, the turbulence
of the Huguenots; the real reason,
the desire to preserve certain royal
prerogatives in church matters,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
with
which the reforms of the council interfered.
So, in the name of Gallican
liberties and royal privileges, the disciplinary
portion was not published
in France. Most of the measures
were actually adopted by the bishops
in provincial councils; but the seed
of great evils was sown. These same
liberties, so called, rendered possible
the chicanery by which the Jansenists
subsequently sought to elude the
solemn condemnations of the holy
see; and at the revolution gave the
idea of the civil constitution of the
clergy, rather than accept which so
many noble bishops and priests gladly
met death. But the French Church
has tired of them; a terrible experience
has taught her that the only true safeguard
of her liberty is, in a close
union with the see of him to whom
Christ confided the duty of strengthening
his brethren. In regard to the
decrees on faith, there was never any
hesitancy in France; and we owe
some of our very best apologetic or
controversial works against Protestantism
to zealous and learned writers
of that nation.</p>

<p>One remarkable consequence of
the council was a great outpouring
of the spirit of sanctity. St. Charles
Borromeo, as prime minister of his
uncle, Pius IV., contributed greatly
to its successful termination. Afterward,
as archbishop of Milan, he set
an example of enforcing its decrees
which has ever since served as a rule
for zealous bishops. He changed
the face of affairs in Lombardy, and
may be said to have led the way in
practically carrying the reforms into
effect. Numbers of holy bishops aided
him, or imitated his example; and
before he died the new discipline was
well established. At Rome, St. Philip
Neri excited in a wonderful way
the spirit of zeal in the clergy, and of
piety in the laity; and his work and
example remain to this day. It is
impossible not to be struck with the
new spirit that had seized the papal
court. The popes themselves were
men not only of blameless lives, but
zealous and active for the good of
religion. A glance at Ranke's history&mdash;especially
the notes at the end&mdash;will
satisfy the reader of this; while
Catholic works abound in edifying
accounts. Such men as Baronius
and Bellarmine were ornaments of
the Sacred College, not only for their
learning, but for their solid, extraordinary
piety, which has barely failed
of obtaining the honors of the altar.
The Society of Jesus, and other religious
orders, were seminaries of virtues,
of zeal, of missionary spirit; and
the heralds of the cross went to the
very ends of the earth to bring the
glad tidings of salvation to those sitting
in darkness. Every state and
condition of life has its saints of this
period. St. Mary Magdalen di Pazzi,
the nun; St. Francis Borgia, the rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
man who gave up all for Christ; St.
Felix of Cantalice, the unlettered lay
brother; St. Aloysius, the pattern of
youth; St. Francis Xavier, the apostle;
St. Charles, the model bishop; St.
Philip Neri, the perfect secular priest;
St. Pius V., the pope who added to
his triple crown the fourth, and greatest,
of sanctity; and many others,
whose names are not so well known
to the world. It was emphatically
the age of saints: war always produces
heroes.</p>

<p>There have been shortcomings since
Trent, because the church has her
human as well as her divine element,
and heresies and scandals, it was foretold
by her divine Founder, must
come; but, by far, not so many as before
it. The contrast between the
ease with which Pius IX. convokes a
general council and the difficulties
with which his predecessors had to
contend in the sixteenth century, is
so plain as to require no comment,
and, at the same time, affords striking
evidence of the efficacy of the
work done at Trent. It was a great
work, in every sense of the word. It
met from the beginning with great
difficulties, which were overcome by
equal constancy; it was devised and
executed by men great in learning,
prudence, and zeal; it effected a reaction
in favor of Catholicity than which
there never occurred "one on a
larger scale in the annals of mankind;"<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
it thoroughly purified the
church from wretched and inveterate
abuses; it revived a spirit of sanctity
that emulated the palmiest days of
the church; and it has handed down
to us the boon of pure faith and strict
observance which our unfortunate opponents
cannot but admire, even
though they attempt to decry it. While
Protestantism was pulling down, the
council built up on a sure foundation;
and its work has been lasting.</p>

<p>Through the lapse of three centuries
the grateful church has ever re-echoed,
as she re-echoes at this day,
the acclamation of the Cardinal of
Lorraine, "The sacred ecumenical
Council of Trent&mdash;let us profess its
faith; let us always observe its decrees.

THE BUREAUCRAT AND THE SWALLOWS.</h3>

<p>Herr Frank returned to the city.
Before he went he took advantage of
the absence of Richard, who had gone
out about nine o'clock, to converse
with Klingenberg about matters of
importance. They sat in the doctor's
studio, the window of which was
open. Frank closed it before he began
the conversation.</p>

<p>"Dear friend, I must speak to you
about a very distressing peculiarity of
my son. I do so because I know
your influence over him, and I hope
much from it."</p>

<p>Klingenberg listened with surprise,
for Herr Frank had begun in great
earnestness and seemed greatly depressed.</p>

<p>"On our journey from the city, I
discovered in Richard, to my great
surprise, a deep-seated antipathy, almost
an abhorrence of women. He
is determined never to marry. He
considers marriage a misfortune, inasmuch
as it binds a man to the
whims and caprices of a wife. If I
had many sons, Richard's idiosyncrasy
would be of little consequence; but as
he is my only son and very stubborn
in his preconceived opinions, you
will see how very distressing it must
be to me."</p>

<p>"What is the cause of this antipathy
of your son to women?"</p>

<p>Herr Frank related Richard's account
of his meeting with Isabella
and his knowledge of the unhappy
marriage of his friend Emil.</p>

<p>"Do you not think that experiences
of this kind must repel a noble-minded
young man?" said the doctor.</p>

<p>"Admitted! But Isabella and Laura
are exceptions, and exceptions by no
means justify my son's perverted judgment
of women. I told him this.
But he still declared that Isabella
and Laura were the rule and not the
exception; that the women of the
present day follow a perverted taste;
and that the wearing of crinoline, a
costume he detests, proves this."</p>

<p>"I know," said the doctor, "that
Richard abominates crinoline. Last
year he expressed his opinion about
it, and I had to agree with him."</p>

<p>"My God!" said the father, astonished,
"you certainly would not encourage
my son in his perverted opinion?"</p>

<p>"No," returned the doctor quietly;
"but you must not expect me to condemn
sound opinions. His judgment
of woman is prejudiced&mdash;granted.
But observe well, my dear Frank.
This judgment is at the same time a
protest of a noble nature against the age
of crinoline. Your son expects much
of women. Superficiality, vanity,
passion for dress, fickleness, and so
forth, do not satisfy his sense of
propriety. Marriage, to him, is an
earnest, holy union. He would
unite himself to a well-disposed woman,
to a noble soul who would love
her husband and her duties, but not
to a degenerate specimen of womankind.
Such I conceive to have been
the reasons which have produced in
your son this antipathy."</p>

<p>"I believe you judge rightly," answered
Frank. "But it must appear
clear to Richard that his views are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
unjust, and that there are always women
who would realize his expectations."</p>

<p>The doctor thought for a moment,
and a significant smile played over
his features.</p>

<p>"This must become clear to him&mdash;yes,
and it will become clear to
him sooner, perhaps, than you expect,"
said the doctor.</p>

<p>"I do not understand you, doctor."</p>

<p>"Yesterday we met Angela," said
Klingenberg. "This Angela is an
extraordinary being of dazzling
beauty; almost the incarnation of
Richard's ideal. I told him of her
fine qualities, which he was inclined
to question. But happily I was able
to establish these qualities by facts.
Now, as Angela lives but a mile from
here and as the simple customs of
the country render access to the family
easy, I have not understood the
character of your son if he does not
take advantage of this opportunity
to become more intimately acquainted
with Angela, even if his object
were only to confirm his former opinions
of women. If he knew Angela
more intimately, it is my firm conviction
that his aversion would soon
change into the most ardent affection."</p>

<p>"Who is this Angela?"</p>

<p>"The daughter of your neighbor,
Siegwart."</p>

<p>Frank looked at the doctor with
open mouth and staring eyes.</p>

<p>"Siegwart's daughter!" he gasped.
"No, I will never consent to such a
connection."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;because the Siegwart family
are not agreeable to me."</p>

<p>"That is no reason. Siegwart is
an excellent man, rich, upright, and
respected by the whole neighborhood.
Why does he happen to appear
so unfavorably in your eyes?"</p>

<p>Frank was perplexed. He might
have reasons and yet be ashamed to
give them.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the doctor, smiling,
"it is now for you to lay aside prejudice."</p>

<p>"An explanation is not possible,"
said Frank. "But my son will rather
die a bachelor than marry Siegwart's
daughter."</p>

<p>Klingenberg shrugged his shoulders.
There was a long pause.</p>

<p>"I renew my request, my friend,"
urged Frank. "Convince my son
of his errors."</p>

<p>"I will try to meet your wishes,"
returned Klingenberg. "Perhaps
this daughter of Siegwart will afford
efficient aid."</p>

<p>"My son's liberty will not be restricted.
He may visit the Siegwart
family when he wishes. But in matters
where the mature mind of
the father has to decide, I shall always
act according to my better
judgment."</p>

<p>The doctor again shrugged his
shoulders. They shook hands, and
in ten minutes after Herr Frank was
off for the train. Richard had left
Frankenhöhe two hours before. He
passed quickly through the vineyard.
A secret power seemed to impel
the young man. He glanced often
at Siegwart's handsome dwelling, and
hopeful suspense agitated his countenance.
When he reached the lawn,
he slackened his pace. He would
reflect, and understand clearly the
object of his visit. He came to observe
Angela, whose character had
made such a strong impression on
him and who threatened to compel
him to throw his present opinions of
women to the winds. He would at
the same time reflect on the consequences
of this possible change to
his peace and liberty.</p>

<p>"Angela is beautiful, very beautiful,
far more so than a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
others who are beautiful but wear
crinoline." He had written in his
diary:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Of what value is corporal beauty that
fades when it is disfigured by bad customs
and caprices? I admit that I have never
yet met any woman so graceful and charming
as Angela; but this very circumstance
warns me to be careful that my judgment
may not be dazzled. If it turns out that
Angela sets herself up as a religious coquette
or a Pharisee, her fine figure is only
a deceitful mask of falsehood, and my opinion
would again be verified. I must make
observations with great care."</p></blockquote>

<p>Frank reviewed these resolutions
as he passed slowly over the lawn,
where some servants were employed,
who greeted him respectfully as he
passed. In the hall he heard a man's
voice that came from the same room
he had entered on his first visit.
The door was open, and the voice
spoke briskly and warmly.</p>

<p>Frank stopped for a moment and
heard the voice say,</p>

<p>"Miss Angela is as lovely as ever."</p>

<p>These words vibrated disagreeably
in Richard's soul, and urged him to
know the man from whom they
came.</p>

<p>Herr Siegwart went to meet the
visitor and offered him his hand.
The other gentleman remained sitting,
and looked at Frank with stately
indifference.</p>

<p>"Herr Frank, my esteemed neighbor
of Frankenhöhe," said Siegwart,
introducing Frank.</p>

<p>The gentleman rose and made a
stiff bow.</p>

<p>"The Assessor von Hamm," continued
the proprietor.</p>

<p>Frank made an equally stiff and
somewhat colder bow.</p>

<p>The three sat down.</p>

<p>While Siegwart rang the bell,
Richard cast a searching glance at
the assessor who had said, "Angela
is as lovely as ever."</p>

<p>The assessor had a pale, studious
color, regular features in which there
was an expression of official importance.
Frank, who was a fine observer,
thought he had never seen
such a perfect and sharply defined
specimen of the bureaucratic type.
Every wrinkle in the assessor's forehead
told of arrogance and absolutism.
The red ribbon in the button-hole
of Herr von Hamm excited
Frank's astonishment. He thought
it remarkable that a young man of
four or five and twenty could have
merited the ribbon of an order. He
might infer from this that decorations
and merit do not necessarily go together.</p>

<p>"How glad I am that you have
kept your word!" said Siegwart to
Frank complacently. "How is your
father?"</p>

<p>"Very well; he goes this morning
to the city, where business calls him."</p>

<p>"I have often admired your father's
attentions to Dr. Klingenberg," said
Siegwart after a short pause. "He
has for years had Frankenhöhe prepared
for the accommodation of the
doctor. You are Klingenberg's constant
companion, and I do not doubt
but such is the wish of your father.
And your father tears himself from
his business and comes frequently
from the city to see that the doctor's
least wish is realized. I have observed
this these last eight years, and I
have often thought that the doctor is
to be envied, on account of this noble
friendship."</p>

<p>"You know, I suppose, that the
doctor saved my father when his life
was despaired of?"</p>

<p>"I know; but there are many physicians
who have saved lives and
who do not find such a noble return."</p>

<p>These words of acknowledgment
had something in them very offensive
to the assessor. He opened and
shut his eyes and mouth, and cast a
grudging, envious look at Richard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>The servant brought a glass.</p>

<p>"Try this wine," said Siegwart;
"my own growth," he added with
some pride.</p>

<p>They touched glasses. Hamm put
his glass to his lips, without drinking;
Frank tasted the noble liquor with
the air of a connoisseur; while Siegwart's
smiling gaze rested on him.</p>

<p>"Excellent! I do not remember
to have drank better Burgundy."</p>

<p>"Real Burgundy, neighbor&mdash;real
Burgundy. I brought the vines from
France."</p>

<p>"Do you not think the vines degenerate
with us?" said Frank.</p>

<p>"They have not degenerated yet.
Besides, proper care and attention
make up for the unsuitableness of
our soil and climate."</p>

<p>"You would oblige me, Herr Siegwart,
if you would preserve me some
shoots when you next trim them."</p>

<p>"With pleasure. I had them set
last year; they shot forth fine roots,
and I can let you have any number
of shoots."</p>

<p>"Is it not too late to plant them?"</p>

<p>"Just the right time. Our vine-growers
generally set them too early.
It should be done in May, and not
in April. Shall I send them over?"</p>

<p>"You are too kind, Herr Siegwart.
My request must certainly destroy
your plan in regard to those shoots."</p>

<p>"Not at all; I have all I can use.
It gives me great pleasure to be able
to accommodate a neighbor. It's settled;
I'll send over the Burgundies
this evening."</p>

<p>It was clear to Hamm that Siegwart
desired to be agreeable to the
wealthy Frank. The assessor opened
and shut his eyes and mouth, and
fidgeted about in his chair. While he
inwardly boiled and fretted, he very
properly concluded that he must consider
himself offended. From the
moment of Frank's arrival, the proprietor
had entirely forgotten him.
He was about to leave, in order not
to expose his nerves to further excitement,
when chance afforded him
an opportunity to give vent to his
ill-humor.</p>

<p>Two boys came running into the
room. They directed their bright
eyes to Siegwart, and their childish,
joyful faces, seemed to say,</p>

<p>"Here we are again; you know
very well what we want."</p>

<p>One of them carried a tin box in
his hand; there was a lock on the box,
and a small opening in the top&mdash;evidently
a money-box.</p>

<p>"Gelobt sei Jesus Christus," said
the children, and remained standing
near the door.</p>

<p>"In Ewigkeit," returned Siegwart.
"Are you there again, my little ones?
That's right; come here, Edward."
And Siegwart took out his purse and
dropped a few pennies into the
box.</p>

<p>"A savings-box? Who gave the
permission?" said the assessor in a
tone that frightened the children, astonished
Richard, and caused Siegwart
to look with embarrassment at
the questioner.</p>

<p>"For the pope, Herr von Hamm,"
said Siegwart.</p>

<p>The official air of the assessor became
more severe.</p>

<p>"The ordinances make no exceptions,"
retorted Hamm. "The ordinances
forbid all collections that are
not officially permitted." And he
eyed the box as if he had a notion to
confiscate it.</p>

<p>Perhaps the lads noticed this, for
they moved backward to the door
and suddenly disappeared from the
room.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon, Herr Assessor,"
said Siegwart. "The Peter-pence is
collected in the whole Catholic world,
and the Catholics of Salingen thought
they ought to assist the head of their
church, who is so sorely pressed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
who has been robbed of his possessions."</p>

<p>"I answer&mdash;the ordinances make
no exceptions; the Peter-pence comes
under the ordinances. I find myself
compelled to interpose against this
trespass."</p>

<p>"But the Peter-pence is collected in
the whole country, Herr von Hamm!
Why, even in the public journals we
read the results of this collection,
and I have never heard that the government
forbade the Peter-pence."</p>

<p>"Leave the government out of the
question. I stand on my instructions.
The government forbids all collections
unless permission is granted. You
must not expect an official to connive
at an open breach of the ordinances.
I will do my duty and remind the
burgomaster of Salingen that he has
not done his."</p>

<p>The occurrence was very annoying
to Siegwart; this could be seen
in his troubled countenance. He
thought of the reproof of the timid
burgomaster, and feared that the
collection might in future be stopped.</p>

<p>"You have the authority, Herr
Assessor, to permit it; I beg you will
do so."</p>

<p>"The request must be made in
written official form," said Hamm.
"You know, Herr Siegwart, that I am
disposed to comply with your wishes,
but I regret I cannot do so in the
present case; and I must openly confess
I oppose the Peter-pence on principle.
The temporal power of the
pope has become unnecessary. Why
support an untenable dominion?"</p>

<p>"I consider the temporal power of
the pope to be a necessity," said Siegwart
emphatically. "If the pope
were not an independent prince, but
the subject of another ruler, he
would in many things have to govern
the church according to the mind
and at the command of his superior.
Sound common sense tells us that
the pope must be free."</p>

<p>"Certainly, as far as I am concerned,"
returned Hamm. "But why
drain the money out of the country
for an object that cannot be accomplished?
I tell you that the
political standing of the bankrupt
papal government will not be saved
by the Peter-pence."</p>

<p>"Permit me to observe, Herr Assessor,
that I differ with you entirely.
The papal government is by no
means bankrupt&mdash;quite the contrary.
Until the breaking out of the Franco-Sardinian
revolution, its finances were
as well managed and flourishing as
those of any state in Europe. I will
convince you of this in a moment."
He went to the bookcase and
handed the assessor a newspaper.
"These statistics will convince you
of the correctness of my assertion."</p>

<p>"As the documents to prove these
statements are wanting, I have great
reason to doubt their correctness," said
Hamm. "Paper will not refuse ink,
and in the present case the pen was
evidently driven by a friendly hand."</p>

<p>"Why do you draw this conclusion?"</p>

<p>"From the contradictions between
this account of the papal finances and
that given by all independent editors."</p>

<p>"Permit me to call that editor not
'an independent,' but a 'friend of the
church.' The enemies of the church
will not praise a church which they
hate. The papal government is the
most calumniated government on
earth; and calumny and falsehood
perform wonders in our times. The
Italian situation furnishes at present
a most striking illustration. The
king of Piedmont has been raised to
the rulership of Italy by the unanimous
voice of the people&mdash;so say the
papers. But the revolution in the
greater part of Italy at the present
time proves that the unanimous voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
of the people was a sham, and that
the Piedmontese government is hated
and despised by the majority of
the Italians. It is the same in many
other things. If falsehood and calumny
were not the order of the day,
falsehood and calumny would not sit
crowned on the throne."</p>

<p>"Right!" said Richard. "It is
indisputable. It is nothing but the
depravity of the times that enables
the emperor to domineer over the
world."</p>

<p>Siegwart heard Frank's observation
with pleasure. Hamm read this in the
open countenance of the proprietor,
and he made a movement as though
he would like to tramp on Frank's
toes.</p>

<p>"I admit the flourishing condition
of the former Papal States," said
Hamm, with a mock smile. "I will
also admit that the former subjects
of the pope, who have been impoverished
by the hungry Piedmontese,
desire the milder papal government.
'There is good living under the crozier,'
says an old proverb. But what
does all this amount to? Does the
beautiful past overthrow the accomplished
facts of the present? The
powers have determined to put an end
to papal dominion. The powers
have partly accomplished this. Can
the Peter-pence change the programme
of the powers? Certainly
not. The papal government must
go the way of all flesh, and if the Catholics
are taxed for an unattainable
object, it is, in my opinion, unjust, to
say the least."</p>

<p>The proprietor shook his head
thoughtfully. "We consider the question
from very different stand-points,"
said he. "Pius IX. is the head of
the church&mdash;the spiritual father of
all Catholics. The revolution has
robbed him of his revenues. Why
should not Catholics give their father
assistance?"</p>

<p>"And I ask," said Hamm, "why
give the pope alms when the powers
are ready to give him millions?"</p>

<p>"On what conditions, Herr Assessor?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;on the very natural condition
that he will acknowledge accomplished
facts."</p>

<p>"You find this condition so natural!"
said Siegwart, somewhat excited.
"Do you forget the position
of the pope? Remember that on
those very principles of which the
pope is the highest representative,
was built the civilization of the present.
The pope condemns robbery,
injustice, violence, and all the principles
of modern revolution. How can
the pope acknowledge as accomplished
facts, results which have sprung
from injustice, robbery, and violence?
The moment the pope does that, he
ceases to be the first teacher of the
people and the vicar of Christ on
earth."</p>

<p>"You take a strong religious position,
my dear friend," said Hamm,
smiling compassionately.</p>

<p>"I do, most assuredly," said the
proprietor with emphasis. "And
I am convinced that my position is
the right one."</p>

<p>Hamm smiled more complacently
still. Frank observed this smile; and
the contemptuous manner of the
official toward the open, kind-hearted
proprietor annoyed him.</p>

<p>"Pius IX. is at any rate a noble
man," said he, looking sharply at the
assessor. "There exists a critical
state of uncertainty in all governments.
All the courts and principalities look to
Paris, and the greatest want of principle
seems to be in the state taxation.
The pope alone does not shrink; he
fears neither the anger nor the threats
of the powers. While thrones are
tumbling, and Pius IX. is not master
in his own house, that remarkable
man does not make the least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
concession to the man in power.
The powers have broken treaties,
trampled on justice, and there is no
longer any right but the right of
revolution&mdash;of force. There is nothing
any longer certain; all is confusion.
The pope alone holds aloft the
banner of right and justice. In his
manifestoes to the world, he condemns
error, falsehood, and injustice.
The pope alone is the shield of those
moral forces which have for centuries
given stability and safety to governments.
This firmness, this confidence
in the genius of Christianity,
this unsurpassed struggle of Pius, deserves
the highest admiration even
of those who look upon the contest
with indifference."</p>

<p>Siegwart listened and nodded assent.
Hamm ate sardines, without paying
the least attention to the speaker.</p>

<p>"The Roman love of power is well
known, and Rome has at all times
made the greatest sacrifices for it,"
said he.</p>

<p>The proprietor drummed with his
fingers on the table. Frank thought
he observed him suppressing his anger,
before he answered,</p>

<p>"Rome does not contend for love
of dominion. She contends for the
authority of religion, for the maintenance
of those eternal principles
without which there is no civilization.
This even Herder, who is far from
being a friend of Rome, admits when
he says, 'Without the church, Europe
would, perhaps, be a prey to
despots, a scene of eternal discord,
and a Mogul wilderness.' Rome's
battle is, therefore, very important,
and honorable. Had it not been for
her, you would not have escaped the
bloody terrorisms of the power-seeking
revolution. Think of French
liberty at present, think of the large
population of Cayenne, of the Neapolitan
prisons, where thousands of
innocent men hopelessly languish."</p>

<p>"You have not understood me, my
dear Siegwart. Take an example for
illustration. The press informs us
almost daily of difficulties between the
government and the clergy. The
cause of this trouble is that the latter
are separated from and wish to oppose
the former. To speak plainly, the
Catholic clergy are non-conforming.
They will not give up that abnormal
position which the moral force of past
times conceded to them. But in organized
states, the clergy, the bishops,
and the pastors should be nothing
more than state officials, whose
rule of conduct is the command of
the sovereign."</p>

<p>"That is to make the church the
servant of the state," said Siegwart.
"Religion, stripped of her divine title,
would be nothing more than the tool
of the minister to restrain the people."</p>

<p>"Well, yes," said the official very
coolly. "Religion is always a strong
curb on the rough, uneducated masses;
and if religion restrains the ignorant,
supports the moral order and the
government, she has fulfilled her
mission."</p>

<p>The proprietor opened wide his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Religion, according to my belief,
educates men not for the state but
for their eternal destiny."</p>

<p>"Perfectly right, Herr Siegwart,
according to your view of the question.
I admire the elevation of your
religious convictions, which all men
cannot rise up to."</p>

<p>A mock smile played on the assessor's
pale countenance as he said this.
Siegwart did not observe it; but
Frank did.</p>

<p>"If I understand you rightly, Herr
Assessor, the clergy are only state
officials in clerical dress."</p>

<p>The assessor nodded his head condescendingly,
and continued to soak
a sardine in olive-oil and take it between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
his knife and fork as Frank
began to speak. The fine-feeling
Frank felt nettled at this contempt,
and immediately chastised Hamm for
his want of politeness.</p>

<p>"I take your nod for an affirmative
answer to my question," said he.
"You will allow me to observe that
your view of the position and purpose
of the clergy must lead to the
most absurd consequences."</p>

<p>The assessor turned an ashy color.
He threw himself back on the sofa
and looked at the speaker with scornful
severity.</p>

<p>"My view is that of every enlightened
statesman of the nineteenth century,"
said he proudly. "How can
you, a mere novice in state matters,
come to such a conclusion."</p>

<p>"I come to it by sound thinking,"
said Frank haughtily. "If the clergy
are only the servants of the state,
they are bound in the exercise of
their functions to follow the instructions
of the state."</p>

<p>"Very natural," said the official.</p>

<p>"If the government think a
change in the church necessary, say
the separation of the school from the
church, the abolition of festivals, the
appointing of infidel professors to
theological chairs, the compiling of
an enlightened catechism&mdash;and all
these relate to the spirit of the times
or the supposed welfare of the state&mdash;then
the clergy must obey."</p>

<p>"That is self-evident," said the assessor.</p>

<p>"You see I comprehend your idea
of the supreme power of the state,"
continued Frank. "The state is supreme.
The church must be deprived
of all independence. She must
not constitute a state within a state.
If it seems good to a minister to abolish
marriage as a sacrament, or the
confessional, or to subject the teaching
of the clergy to a revision by the
civil authority, because a majority of
the chambers wish it, or because the
spirit of the age demands it, then
the opposition of the clergy would be
illegal and their resistance disobedience."</p>

<p>"Naturally&mdash;naturally," said the
official impatiently. "Come, now,
let us have the proof of your assertion."</p>

<p>"Draw the conclusions from what
I have said, Herr Assessor, and you
have the most striking proof of the
absurdity and ridiculousness of your
gagged state church," said Frank
haughtily.</p>

<p>"How so, how so?" cried Hamm
inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Simply thus: If the priest must
preach according to the august instructions
of the state and not according
to the principles of religious dogma,
he would then preach Badish in
Baden, Hessish in Hesse, Bavarian
in Bavaria, Mecklenburgish in Mecklenburg;
in short, there would be as
many sects as there are states and
principalities. And these sects would
be constantly changing, as the chambers
or ministerial instructions would
command or allow. All religion would
cease; for it would be no longer the expression
of the divine will and revelation,
but the work of the chambers and
the princes. Such a religion would
be contemptible in the eyes of every
thinking man. I would not give a
brass button for such a religion."</p>

<p>"You go too far, Herr Frank,"
said Hamm. "Religion has a divine
title, and this glory must be retained."</p>

<p>"Then the clergy must be free."</p>

<p>"Certainly, that is clear," said the
assessor as he arose, and, with a
smiling face, bowed lowly. Angela
had entered the hall, and in consequence
of Hamm's greeting was
obliged to come into the room. She
might have returned from a walk, for
she wore a straw hat and a light
shawl was thrown over her shoulders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
She led by the hand her little sister
Eliza, a charming child of four years.</p>

<p>The sisters remained standing near
the door. Eliza looked with wondering
eyes at the stranger, whose
movements were very wonderful to
the mind of the little one, and whose
pale face excited her interest.</p>

<p>Angela's glance seemed to have
blown away all the official dust that
remained in the soul of Hamm. The
assessor was unusually agreeable.
His face lost its obstinate expression,
and became light and animated.
Even its color changed to one of life
and nature.</p>

<p>To Richard, who liked to take
notes, and whose visit to Siegwart's
had no other object, the change that
could be produced in a bureaucrat
by such rare womanly beauty was
very amusing. He had arisen and
stepped back a little. He observed
the assessor carefully till a smile between
astonishment and pity lit up
his countenance. He then looked
at Angela, who stood motionless
on the same spot. It seemed
to require great resignation on
her part to notice the flattering
speech and obsequious attentions of
the assessor. Richard observed that
her countenance was tranquil, but her
manner more grave than usual. She
still held the little one by the hand,
who pressed yet closer to her the
nearer the wonderful man came.
Hamm's voice rose to a tone of enthusiasm,
and he took a step or two
toward the object of his reverence,
when a strange enemy confronted
him. Some swallows had come in
with Angela. Till now they were
quiet and seemed to be observing the
assessor; but when he approached
Angela, briskly gesticulating, the
swallows raised their well-known
shrill cry of anxiety, left their perches
and fluttered around the official. Interrupted
in the full flow of his eloquence,
he struck about with his
hands to frighten them. The swallows
only became the noisier, and
their fluttering about Hamm assumed
a decidedly warlike character. They
seemed to consider him as a dangerous
enemy of Angela whom they
wished to keep off. Richard looked
on in wonder, Siegwart shook his
head and stroked his beard, and Angela
smiled at the swallows.</p>

<p>"These are abominable creatures,"
cried Hamm warding them off.
"Why, such a thing never happened
to me before. Off with you! you
troublesome wretches."</p>

<p>The birds flew out of the room,
still screaming; and their shrill cries
could be heard high up in the air.</p>

<p>"The swallows have a grudge
against you," said Siegwart. "They
generally treat only the cats and
hawks in this way."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they have been frightened
at this red ribbon," returned
Hamm. "I regret, my dear young
lady, to have frightened your little
pets. When I come again, I will
leave the object of their terror at
home."</p>

<p>"You should not deprive yourself
of an ornament which has an honorable
significance on account of the
swallows, particularly as we do not
know whether it was really the red
color that displeased them," said she.</p>

<p>"You think, then, Miss Angela,
that there is something else about me
they dislike?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, Herr Assessor."</p>

<p>"Oh! if I only knew the cause of
their displeasure," said Hamm enthusiastically.
"You have an affection
for the swallows, and I would not displease
any thing that you love."</p>

<p>She answered by an inclination,
and was about to leave the room.</p>

<p>"Angela," said her father, "here is
Herr Frank, to whom you are under
obligations."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>She moved a step or two toward
Richard.</p>

<p>"Sir," said she gently, "you returned
some things that were valuable to
me; were it not for your kindness,
they would probably have been lost.
I thank you."</p>

<p>A formal bow was Frank's answer.
Hamm stood smiling, his searching
glance alternating between the stately
young man and Angela. But in
the manner of both he observed
nothing more than reserve and cold
formality.</p>

<p>Angela left the room. The assessor
sat down on the sofa and poured out
a glass of wine.</p>

<p>Eliza sat on her father's knee.
Richard observed the beautiful child
with her fine features and golden
silken locks that hung about her tender
face. The winning expression
of innocence and gentleness in her
mild, childish eyes particularly struck
him.</p>

<p>"A beautiful, lovely child," said
he involuntarily, and as he looked in
Siegwart's face he read there a deep
love and a quiet, fatherly fondness
for the child.</p>

<p>"Eliza is not always as lovely and
good as she is now," he returned.
"She has still some little faults which
she must get rid of."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's what Angela said,"
chattered the little one. "Angela
said I must be very good; I must
love to pray; I must obey my father
and mother; then the angels who are
in heaven will love me."</p>

<p>"Can you pray yet, my child," said
Richard.</p>

<p>"Yes, I can say the 'Our Father'
and the 'Hail Mary.' Angela
is teaching me many nice prayers."</p>

<p>She looked at the stranger a moment
and said with childish simplicity,</p>

<p>"Can you pray too?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, my child," answered
Frank, smiling; "but I doubt whether
my prayers are as pleasing to
God as yours."</p>

<p>"Angela also said we should not
lie," continued Eliza. "The good
God does not love children who lie."</p>

<p>"That is true," said Frank. "Obey
your sister Angela."</p>

<p>Here the young man was affected
by a peculiar emotion. He thought
of Angela as the first instructor of the
child; placed near this little innocent,
she appeared like its guardian angel.
He saw clearly at this moment the
great importance of first impressions
on the young, and thought that in
after life they would not be obliterated.
He expressed his thoughts, and
Siegwart confirmed them.</p>

<p>"I am of your opinion, Herr Frank.
The most enduring impressions are
made in early childhood. The germ
of good must be implanted in the
tender and susceptible heart of the
child and there developed. Many,
indeed most parents overlook this
important principle of education.
This is a great and pernicious error.
Man is born with bad propensities;
they grow with his growth and increase
with his strength. In early
childhood, they manifest themselves
in obstinacy, wilfulness, excessive
love of play, disobedience, and a disposition
to lie. If these outgrowths
are plucked up and removed in childhood
by careful, religious training, it
will be much easier to form the heart
to habits of virtue than in after years.
Many parents begin to instruct their
children after they have spoiled
them. Is this not your opinion, Herr
Assessor?"</p>

<p>Hamm was aroused by this sudden
question. He had not paid any
attention to the conversation, but had
been uninterruptedly stroking his
moustache and gazing abstractedly
into vacancy.</p>

<p>"What did you ask, my dear Siegwart?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Whether I am of your opinion?
Certainly, certainly, entirely
of your opinion. Your views are
always sound, practical, and matured
by great experience, as in this case."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't say you were always
of my opinion," said Siegwart
smiling; "have we not just been
sharply disputing about the Peter-pence?"</p>

<p>"O my dear friend! as a private
individual I agree with you entirely
on these questions; but an official
must frequently defend in a system
of government that which he privately
condemns."</p>

<p>Frank perceived Hamm's object.
He wished to do away with the unfavorable
impressions his former expressions
might have made on the
proprietor. The reason of this was
clear to him since he had discovered
the assessor's passion for Angela.</p>

<p>"I am rejoiced," said Siegwart,
"that we agree at least in that most
important matter, religion."</p>

<p>Frank remembered his father's remark,
"The Siegwart family is intensely
clerical and ultramontane."
It was new and striking to him to
see the question of religion considered
the most important. He concluded
from this, and was confirmed
in his conclusions by the leading spirit
of the Siegwart family, that, in
direct contradiction to modern ideas,
religion is the highest good.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," said Siegwart, "I
object to a system of government
that is inimical to the church."</p>

<p>"And so do I," sighed the assessor.</p>

<p>Richard took his departure. At
home, he wrote a few hasty lines in
his diary and then went into the
most retired part of the garden.
Here he sat in deep thought till the
servant called him to dinner.</p>

<p>"Has Klingenberg not gone out
yet to-day?"</p>

<p>"No, but he has been walking up
and down his room for the last two
hours."</p>

<p>Frank smiled. He guessed the
meaning of this walk, and as they
both entered the dining-room together
his conjecture was confirmed.</p>

<p>The doctor entered somewhat abruptly
and did not seem to observe
Richard's presence. His eyes had
a penetrating, almost fierce expression
and his brows were knit. He
sat down to the table mechanically,
and ate what was placed before him.
It is questionable whether he knew
what he was eating, or even that he was
eating. He did not speak a word,
and Frank, who knew his peculiarities,
did not disturb him by a single syllable.
This was not difficult, as he
was busily occupied with his own
thoughts.</p>

<p>After the meal was over, Klingenberg
came to himself. "My dear
Richard, I beg your pardon," said
he in a tone of voice which was almost
tender. "Excuse my weakness.
I have read this morning a
scientific article that upsets all my
previous theories on the subject
treated of. In the whole field of human
investigation there is nothing
whatever certain, nothing firmly established.
What one to-day proves
by strict logic to be true, to-morrow
another by still stronger logic proves
to be false. From the time of Aristotle
to the present, philosophers
have disagreed, and the infallible philosopher
will certainly never be born.
It is the same in all branches. I
would not be the least astonished if
Galileo's system would be proved to
be false. If the instruments, the
means of acquiring astronomical
knowledge, continue to improve, we
may live to learn that the earth
stands still and that the sun goes
waltzing around our little planet.
This uncertainty is very discouraging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
to the human mind. We might say
with Faust,</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'It will my heart consume<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That we can nothing know.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"In my humble opinion," said
Frank, "every investigator moves in
a limited circle. The most profound
thinker does not go beyond these set
limits; and if he would boldly over-step
them, he would be thrown back
by evident contradiction into that
circle which Omnipotence has drawn
around the human intellect."</p>

<p>"Very reasonable, Richard; very
reasonable. But the desire of knowledge
must sometimes be satiated,"
continued the doctor after a short
pause. "If the human mind were
free from the narrow limits of the
deceptive world of sense, and could
see and know with pure spiritual
eyes, the barriers of which you speak
would fall. Even the Bible assures
us of this. St. Paul, writing to the
Corinthians, says, 'We see now
through a glass in an obscure manner,
but then face to face; now I
know in part, but then I shall know
as I am known.' I would admire
St. Paul on account of this passage
alone if he never had written another.
How awful is the moral quality of
the human soul taken in connection
with its future capacity for knowledge.
And how natural, how evident,
is the connection. The human
mind will receive knowledge from
the source of all knowledge&mdash;God, in
proportion as it has been just and
good. For this reason our Redeemer
calls the world of the damned
'outer darkness,' and the world of
the blessed, the 'kingdom of light.'"</p>

<p>"We sometimes see in that way
even now," said Frank after a pause.
"The wicked have ideas very different
from those of the good. A frivolous
spirit mocks at and derides that
which fills the good with happiness
and contentment. We might, then,
say that even in this life man knows
as he is known."</p>

<p>The doctor cast an admiring glance
at the young man. "We entirely
agree, my young friend; wickedness
is to the sciences what a poisonous
miasma and the burning rays of the
sun are to the young plants. Yes,
vice begets atheism, materialism, and
every other abortion of thought."</p>

<p>Klingenberg arose.</p>

<p>"We will meet again at three,"
said he with a friendly nod.</p>

<p>Richard took from his room <i>Vogt's
Physiological Letters</i>, went into the
garden, and buried himself in its contents.</p>

<h2>MORALITY OF THE CITY OF ROME.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></h2>


<p>We promised in our last number
to pay our respects to an infamous
calumny about Rome, the capital of
the Christian Church, and seat of the
Sovereign Pontiffs, Vicars of our
Lord Jesus Christ upon earth.</p>

<p>This calumny has been extensively
circulated. We have found it in each
one of the works at the head of this
article, and we suppose it has been
repeated in many others which have
not fallen under our observation; for
our "evangelical" journals, as they
style themselves, and a large portion
of the secular press, seem to have
very loose notions of morality where
the Catholic Church is concerned.
Every story to her disadvantage will
be sure to please their public, or to
supply the want of argument, and
therefore it is seized upon with eagerness
and repeated over the length
and breadth of the land. It matters
little to them whether it be true or
not, so long as it answers the purpose.
It is enough for them that
somebody or other has started it,
without inquiring who it was, or
whether he had any right to make
such a statement. It is also quite
immaterial how improbable the story
may be, or what contradictions it
may involve, or out of what ingenious
inferences, by putting this and that
together, it may be constructed; it
suffices that it be something injurious
to the Catholic religion, and at
once the end sanctifies the means;
and God, they seem to think, will
easily wink at any breach of the commandment,
"Thou shalt not bear
false witness against thy neighbor,"
when that neighbor is only a papist.
Besides, the appetite of the public for
this sort of thing seems to be so insatiable
that they are deemed ready
to swallow any thing, however it may
outrage common sense or probability;
and therefore they do not fear any
loss of reputation if they are detected
in the circulation of the falsehood.
Corporations are said to have no
souls, and the reverend editor of a
religious periodical easily seems to
absolve himself from any obligation
which Christian charity or even decency
would seem to impose upon
him, in regard to the papist, whom
he readily classes with the infidel or
the pagan.</p>

<p>The calumny we are about to refute
furnishes us with an apt illustration
of these remarks. It wears on
its face an air of extreme improbability.
It is to this effect: that in
Rome nearly three fourths of all the
children born are illegitimate.</p>

<p>This is simply incredible. When
we read of half the children in Stockholm,
in Protestant Sweden, or in
Vienna, in Catholic Austria, being
illegitimate, we can scarcely believe
the naked statement. Without disputing
the official figures, we look to
see if there is no way of explaining
this anomalous state of things&mdash;if the
reality corresponds with the appearance.
The large excess in the number
of births in proportion to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
population, and the existence of a
large foundling hospital, as in Vienna,
used by the poorer inhabitants of the
country around even to a considerable
distance, would lead us to a
sounder conclusion in regard to its
social state than the bare inspection
of the figures. But the supposition
that three fourths of all the children
born in Rome or any other city, Protestant
or Catholic, are illegitimate, is
too exaggerated to be entertained for
a moment. It seems to find ready
credence, however; probably through
some such mental process as this:
"Catholics are corrupt and vicious.
Rome is the chief of all Catholic
cities, and therefore the most corrupt
and vicious of all, and no story of its
corruption is too big for belief. The
more incredible for any other place,
the more worthy of belief for Rome."</p>

<p>But let us come more to details
about this statement in regard to
Rome. We quote from Mr. Seymour's
book:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the Italian statistics of Mittermaier
we have the number of exposed infants received
in Il S. Spirito, Il Conservatorio, and
other establishments of this class. The
number received during a series of ten
years amounts to 31,689. This total distributed
among the ten years gives as the
mean, the number of 3160 infants exposed
annually in the city of Rome."</p></blockquote>

<p>He goes on to say that according
to Bowring, an agent of the British
government, the population of Rome
was 153,678, and the total number
of births was 4373. Hence we
have,</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="Births in Rome">
<tr><td class="tdl">Total number of births,</td><td class="tdr">4373</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Total number of foundlings,</td><td class="tdr">3160</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>And we are left to infer that there
were only 1213 lawful children born
in Rome in that year.</p>

<p>To make a still closer deduction
from his premises, we should take his
remark that the population of Rome
should be taken at the mean of 130,000,
instead of 153,678. The mean
number of births corresponding to
this would be 3700; hence, in strictness,
we should have,</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="Rome foundlings and lawful">
<tr><td class="tdl">Total number of births,</td><td class="tdr">3700</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Total number of foundlings,</td><td class="tdr">3160</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Total number of lawful children,</td><td class="tdr">540</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>This is indeed a state of things described
by Mr. Seymour as indicating
"a frightful number of illegitimate
births, and a number without parallel
of cruel and unnatural mothers."
And we may add, it indicates an unparalleled
amount of gullibility in any
one who will entertain for a moment
such an absurd statement. It would
be more creditable to Rev. Mr. Seymour
and his friend Rev. L. W. Bacon
and <cite>The New Englander</cite>, before circulating
the story, to inquire who Mittermaier
is; whether he has said exactly
what he is quoted to say; whether he
was misled about his statements;
whether some one else has not altered
what he said; whether some word has
not been used in a double sense, to
carry a wrong impression, or some
word slipped into the general statement
to put the reader on the wrong track;
in short, to pay great attention and
be extremely cautious in a matter
which wears so great an improbability
on its face.</p>

<p>The story is an absurd fabrication,
and very clumsily put together at
that. "The number of exposed infants
in Il S. Spirito, Il Conservatorio,
and other establishments of
this class, according to Mittermaier,
amounts to 31,689 in ten years."
Mittermaier, or whoever else wrote
this, proves conclusively that he
knew very little of what he was
writing about. There is no such establishment
as Il Conservatorio in
Rome. This is not the name of a
particular place, but a general term
signifying about what we mean by
the term "asylum." There are more
than a dozen asylums for children in
Rome, but only one is a foundling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
hospital, that of Il S. Spirito. The
conservatorios or asylums are not "of
this class," but of a different class
altogether. There may have been
3160 children provided for, annually,
in Il S. Spirito and all the different
establishments for children, for what
we know, and we see no reason to
dispute the statement; but this is the
aggregate of children of all ages and
all sorts, of the sick and destitute,
and by no means the number of
foundlings received, or even the number
of orphans received within a single
year.</p>

<p>There are over 400 children in one
orphan asylum in Fiftieth street in
this city, and the aggregate for ten
years would be over 4000, but to say
that over 4000 children were <em>received</em>
there in ten years would be an outrageous
statement. To obtain the real
number, we should also ascertain the
average number of years each child
remains in the institution.</p>

<p>The hospital of Il S. Spirito
is the only "foundling hospital" in
Rome. It receives all the infants
brought there, and if the person who
brings them is unwilling to answer,
he can refuse to do so. It is amply
sufficient to accommodate all left there;
has revenue enough, and, in short,
renders the existence of "any other
establishment of the sort" entirely
superfluous. There are branches of
this institution to which "foundlings"
are transferred as they grow
older. The institution looks out for
them until they can look out for
themselves; but there is only one
place where they are received.</p>

<p>The total number of foundlings
received in Rome is about 900 annually.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
Maguire says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The number of 900 may seem very
great as representing the annual average
received; but it should be stated that the
hospital of Santo Spirito affords an asylum
not only to the foundlings of Rome, but to
those of the provinces of Sabina, Frosinone,
Velletri, and the Comarca, and also districts
on the borders of Naples."</p></blockquote>

<p>This number of foundlings does
not represent the amount of illegitimacy,
for very many of the foundlings
are lawful children. Maguire
says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If it happen, as it often does with people
in the humblest condition of life, that
their family exceed their means of support,
one of the children is committed to the
wheel of the foundling hospital of Santo
Spirito&mdash;it might be, with some mark on
its dress by which its identity would be
afterward proved and it be reclaimed by its
parents, a thing of no uncommon occurrence.
Another frequent cause of having
recourse to this institution is the delicacy
of the mother, or of the child. The mother
has no nourishment to give the infant,
and she bears it to the hospital to be provided
for. Or it is a rickety, miserable thing
from its birth, stunted, malformed, or so
delicate that in the rude hut of its parents
it has no chance of ever doing well; then
too, in its case, the wheel of the hospital is
a safe recourse, and with parents of hard
hearts takes the place of many an evil suggestion,
such as is often present in the homes
and the breasts of the destitute. Frequently
the parent is known to argue that the infirm
or malformed child, who is thus got
rid of, has the best chance of recovery, and
certainty of being provided for, where eminent
medical attendance is always to be
had, and where the greatest care is taken of
the training and future interests of the foundling.
It may be said that this facility of
getting rid of legitimate offspring leads to a
disregard of the manifest obligations of a parent's
duty; but to this fair objection I can
only offer a preponderating advantage, that
it does away with that awful proneness to
infanticide which distinguishes other countries,
but pre-eminently England."</p></blockquote>

<p>This estimate of Maguire's is confirmed
by a statement taken from
the records of the hospital for May,
June, and July, 1868, and transmitted
to us by an American clergyman residing
in Rome. Of the total number,
some were of legitimate births,
as shown by authentic parish certificates;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
others of doubtful or uncertain
birth; as follows:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="Foundlings legitimate or uncertain">
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Foundlings received.</td>
<td class="tdc">Of legitimate birth.</td>
<td class="tdc">Uncertain.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">In May,</td>
<td class="tdc">38</td>
<td class="tdc">46</td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">In June,</td>
<td class="tdc">25</td>
<td class="tdc">51</td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">In July,</td>
<td class="tdc tdbb">29</td>
<td class="tdc tdbb">49</td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">&nbsp;</td>
<td class="tdc">92</td>
<td class="tdc">146</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>This would give us an aggregate
of 952 for the year, of which 584
would be of uncertain birth. A large
proportion came from the provinces
around Rome, and there is no reason
to suppose all the uncertain births to
be illegitimate; therefore we shall
make a liberal allowance if we take
the total number of foundlings of illegitimate
birth, belonging to Rome itself,
at 400. The real number is
quite as likely to be below as above it.</p>

<p>When Mittermaier, whoever he
was, stated the annual number of
foundlings in Rome to be 3160, the
mean population of that city was
stated to be 130,000. It is now
215,573. By Mittermaier's proportion
the annual number of foundlings
should now be 5226. Are we called
on to believe this, and to hang our
heads in shame at this enormous
number of 5226 illegitimates each
year in the capital of the Catholic
world? And this, when we know
that the actual number of foundlings
from Rome is not over 900, and the
actual number of illegitimate children
is about 400.</p>

<p>A small discrepancy, no doubt; a
little peccadillo in the figures! We
hope we have not shown any undue
warmth in exposing it; for who
knows, our "evangelic" friends may
feel themselves insulted, and entirely
absolved from any obligation of refuting
us; our unchristian warmth of
temper and vituperative manner being
enough&mdash;to use the expression of
Rev. L. W. Bacon, in <cite>The New Englander</cite>&mdash;"to
discredit without any
particular refutation" whatever we
assert in this article.</p>

<p>But whence come the three thousand
one hundred and sixty foundlings
of "Mittermaier" annually received
in Rome? Without doubt,
from adding up all the inmates of the
different asylums for children in
Rome, and the foundlings of S.
Spirito, and representing the total as
an aggregate of <em>foundlings received</em>.</p>

<p>These are institutions of which Dr.
Neligan, who visited them, gives an
account in his <i>Rome</i>, published by
Messrs. Sadlier; and to these must
be added the department of S. Spirito,
where female foundlings, after being
nursed, are received back&mdash;if not otherwise
provided for&mdash;and taken care
of for life, or until they marry or get
a situation; this numbers about six
hundred, according to Maguire. If
we add all the numbers together, and
also the children under the care of
the foundling hospital out at nurse,
or being brought up in private families;
in short, all the recipients of
charity of the different institutions of
Rome, we might approach a number
corresponding to the three thousand
one hundred and sixty of Mittermaier.</p>

<p>We can see by this "how the noble
and Christian charity of Rome, excelling
that of any other city of its
size on the earth, is," by a base and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
groundless falsehood, sought to be
turned into a means of holding her
up to the scorn and indignation of
the whole world.</p>

<p>We can show, also, in an entirely
different way, by the official census of
Rome, the absurdity of the statement
of Seymour, and that in the most conclusive
manner. In the <cite>Civilta Cattolica</cite>
of 21st of December, 1867, we
have the census of the population
and the number of births for the year
1866; also a tabular statement of
those for a period of ten years, ending
21st of April, 1867.</p>

<p>From these we find the present
population to be 215,573; the number
of the legitimate births for the
year from Easter, 1866, to Easter,
1867, was 5739, and adding thereto
the still-born, 6120. The average
annual number of births in an average
population of 197,737, excluding
the still-born, was 5657 legitimate,
for the decennial period. Adding
the still-born, we have an annual
average of over 6000 legitimate births.</p>

<p>Now, if we consider that in Rome
there is a large class of the population
who belong to the clergy, who
do not marry; a large body of military;
the Jews, whose children of
course do not appear in any baptismal
register, from which the number
of annual births is made out; we
may set down the average productive
part of the population, corresponding
to the population of any other
city, at an average of not more than
175,000. From this number, according
to the general vital statistics of
the civilized world, we must look for
from 6300 to 6400 annual births.
Take from this the number of annual
legitimate births stated above, and
there remains no margin for any large
number of illegitimate births. Any
one can see that it is a moral impossibility
that they should exceed three
or four hundred.</p>

<p>The same thing can be made out
by means of the number of the married,
which is accurately taken every
year. In April, 1867, there were
30,471 married women in Rome.
Now, how many children could be
expected to be born annually from
that number? We can approximate
very nearly to this by considering the
census of the kingdom of Italy, as
given in the <cite>Civilta Cattolica</cite> of 20th
of June, 1868. From this we find
that for about 4,297,346 married
women there were about 900,000
births, which gives us one yearly
for every five married women, very
nearly. Applying this proportion to
Rome, we should have of 30,471
married women, 6094 births. The
actual number, including still-born,
was, as we have seen, 6120.</p>

<p>The <cite>Civilta Cattolica</cite> says, "This
proportion of 28.3 of legitimate births
for every one thousand of the population
speaks very well for a capital
city." And so it does; it shows,
what we have always understood
them to be, that the Romans are as
virtuous and moral as any people of
the world.</p>

<p>In passing, we commend to the
Rev. Mr. Bacon the figures of the
official census of the kingdom of
Italy, from which we find the percentage
of illegitimacy for 1863 to
have been 4.8; for 1864, 5. It is to
be observed that there is somewhat
of a deterioration in this last year,
perhaps owing to the success of the
efforts of the Bible and tract societies
to throw the pure light of "gospel
truth" on this hitherto benighted land.
The rate of illegitimacy in Scotland,
which Mr. Laing, in his <i>Notes of a
Traveller</i>, calls the most religious
Protestant country in Europe, is
double that of Italy, the country
most thoroughly Catholic.</p>

<p>And we ask, moreover, of Mr. Bacon,
the direct question, What is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
honesty of representing the relative
chastity of England and Italy as 5 to
21, when the real proportions are 6.4
to 5? It may do very well to
charge Brother Hatfield and Brother
Prime, when you have your own
good name to vindicate against their
charges, with gross unfairness in controversy;
but we consider your adroit
shirking of all the statements of <span class="smcap">The
Catholic World</span>, on the plea of an
error found in a quotation from <cite>The
Church and World</cite>, as quite as dishonorable
as any thing you have
charged against them. Your persistence
in repeating calumnious statements,
and spreading them out as you
do among readers who will not see
the refutation, will give you and
your friend, Mr. M. Hobart Seymour,
an unenviable notoriety among the
worst calumniators of the Catholic religion
who have as yet appeared. You
have repeated, some time ago, that
most infamous calumny of the <i>Tax-book
of the Roman Chancery</i>, so amply
refuted by Bishop England; but
although it has been called to your
notice, you have never had the grace
to apologize. The old maxim seems
to have been, "Lie as hard as you
can, and lay it on thick, for it will all
be believed," and hence we had our
Maria Monks and our Brownlees.
Now the tactics are to be changed,
and the maxim seems to be, "Let
there be some semblance of truth
mixed with the lie, so that it may sink
deeper; let the calumny be sugared
over with professions of 'fair play,'
and it will work with better effect;" and
hence come such things as the <i>Moral
Results of Romanism</i>, by Messrs. Seymour
and Bacon, the "model controversialists."</p>

<p>To come back to Rome. The
<cite>Civilta Cattolica</cite> tells us that the census
has been taken in the same way
since the sixteenth century. The total
number of births, 4373, of Bowring,
were then the total of legitimate
births, not the absolute total. The
number of 3160 <em>foundlings received</em>
turns out to be the number of orphans&mdash;some
of them 80 years old, for
all we know; for some are cared for as
long as they live&mdash;and other destitute
or abandoned children. And thus this
beautiful piece of "mosaic work," intended
to exhibit the horrible vice of
Rome to the gaze of an admiring
and astonished public, falls to pieces.
Instead of the anomalous state of
things in which each married couple
in Rome would have on an average
one child in the space of 25 years,
they are found to be quite as prolific
as other people, and quite as virtuous.
Rome, in respect to offences
against chastity, is probably the most
orderly and decent city of its size in
the world. Maguire says:<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The returns (criminal) embrace all
kinds of crime.... And among the
rest they comprehend a class of offenders
who, in some countries&mdash;for instance, in
France&mdash;are under the control as well as
sanctioned by the police authorities, and in
others defy almost all authority or restraint
whatsoever. I allude to women of depraved
character, not one of whom is to be met
with in the streets of Rome, which may accordingly
be traversed with impunity at any
hour of the evening or night by a modest
female without the risk of having her eyes
and ears offended, as they are in too many
cities of our highly civilized empire. Offenders
of this class are at once made amenable
to the law, and committed either to
the Termini, or to the institution of the
Good Shepherd, where the most effectual
means of reformation are adopted, and in
very many instances with success&mdash;both institutions
being specially under the care and
control of religious communities."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is the fashion to decry Rome&mdash;to
represent her population as cowed
down and discontented with their
government; to this the reception
which Garibaldi with his war-cry of
"Rome or death"&mdash;though he lived to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
see another day, after all&mdash;met with
from the Roman people, is a sufficient
reply: or to say that they are miserably
poor or degraded; to this,
Count de Reyneval, in his report to
the French minister for foreign affairs,
says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The condition of the population is one
of comparative ease.... An appearance
of prosperity strikes the eyes of the
least observant. Gaiety of the most expansive
kind is to be traced in the faces of all.
It may be asked whether this can be the
people whose miseries excite to such a degree
the commiseration of Europe?"<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Rome, then, with a garrison of
over 7000 soldiers, and with an immense
influx of visitors from all parts
of the world, and particularly of
wealthy pleasure-seekers from England
and America; with a stern suppression
of prostitution and public
vice, still shows a rate of illegitimacy
less than six per cent; a rate lower
than that of England, or any
Protestant country which has published
statistics on the subject.</p>

<p>We have thus given this matter as
thorough and complete an investigation
as has been possible under the
circumstances. We have given the
reasons for all we have stated, and
the reader can see for himself the
force of our arguments. We neither
desire to misrepresent nor to be misrepresented;
and we would not make
one misstatement to the disadvantage
of any one, be he Protestant or any
thing else; or conceal any thing which
has a bearing on the question, even
if it should put our side of it in
an unfavorable light. If we have
done any of these things, it is unconsciously
to ourselves; and therefore
we feel, perhaps too warmly and indignantly,
this trickery, when it is attempted
to make us the victims of it.</p>

<p>From our previous experience, we
look for a more active circulation of
this calumny, from our refutation of
it; but we console ourselves with the
reflection that there is a God in heaven
who watches over all, and who will
make the truth apparent in due
time. At any rate, no such consideration
shall hinder us a moment
from exposing error and deception, so
far as our occupations and duties
shall afford us the leisure to do so.</p>

<h3>PART II.</h3>

<p>I entered the novitiate on the
22d. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Veni sponsa Christi, accipe
coronam quam tibi Dominus præparavit
in æternum</i> has been sounding in
my heart ever since like a war-cry,
animating me to the interior combat.
For the cloister is that oasis in the
great desert of the world where is
carried on a vital combat between
nature and grace, more furious than
that between Christian and Paynim
in the Diamond of the desert. I have
been much happier since I entered
upon my new life, and am glad I can
go out no more. I love the solitude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and calmness of the cloister, which
at last extends to the heart; I love
the shrines "where their vigils pale-eyed
virgins keep;" I love the companionship
of those who seem unsullied
by earthly passions; and I love
this release from all earthly care, with
no thought for what we shall eat, or
what we shall drink, or wherewithal
we shall be clothed. Is it not better
than the bustle and vanity of the
world, which almost efface the thought
of God?</p>

<p>And then, you know, I have always
believed that there are some who
are called to perpetuate the glorious
fellowship of Christ's sufferings; to
share, as members of his body, the
pains and sorrows of the great Head
of the church; and to make reparation
to heaven for the constant outrages
against the Divine Majesty. As
Faber says, "Nuns are the turtle-doves
of the church, who have to
mourn in a spirit of loving sorrow
and sweet reparation over the wrongs
of their heavenly Spouse."</p>

<p>The heart of St. Augustine was so
full of the love of God and the
sense of what is his due, that he is
always represented holding it all
aflame in his hands. Old legends
tell us how an angel bore it away to a
sanctuary, where it will still tremble in
its crystal case if an unbeliever enters
the church where it is exposed. So
tremulously alive to the honor and
glory of God should be the hearts
that are gathered together in the cloister.
How many souls fly thither to
make up, as it were, to God what is
wanting on the part of their sinful
brethren! <i>Apropos</i>, I must tell you
about one of our nuns, who is full of
holy fervor. In the late retreat, the
director asked her the subject of her
particular examen. "Self-abnegation,"
was the reply. "Do you find
many occasions for practising it?"
inquired the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">père</i>. "Not as many as
I could wish." "What is the virtue
which you particularly ask of our
Lord in your devotions, and by the
actions of each day?" "I ask for
no virtue, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon père</i>." "With what
intention, then, do you offer them?"
"For the conversion of sinners, and
the greater glory of God."</p>

<p>Is not this admirable? I am sure
many Protestants could hardly comprehend
a piety so disinterested as to
lose sight, in a measure, of one's own
profit in zeal for God's cause.</p>

<p>The facilities are also great in the
cloister for the frequent reception of
the sacraments, which quicken the
moral circulation. The pulsations of
the soul are more healthful after the
infusion of divine grace through
them. I went to holy communion
this morning. The Divine Host
seemed to me a burning coal from
off the altar of God, and the priest,
the angel who placed it on my lips.
"Our God is a consuming fire." I
prayed that he might consume every
affection in my heart that was not
centred in him; and, as I felt the
torrent of divine flame circulating in
my veins, every earthly desire, every
human passion, seemed to die away
within me. For a moment, at least,
I felt the signification of the words
of the great apostle of the Gentiles,
"It is no longer I who live, but
Christ who liveth in me." Might
such moments be perpetuated! But
it is of faith that those who have
partaken of Christ's body and blood
remain in him, and he in them, as
long as they are in a state of grace.
It is this interior presence of the
divinity which animated the saints to
the sacrifice, and made even this
world, amid all their privations and
austerities, a very foretaste of heaven.
What sweet solemnity and thoughtfulness
reign in the heart sensible of
this divine presence! In its light the
soul,</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Like the stained web that whitens in the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grows pure by being purely shone upon."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As you say, a great deal does depend
upon the influences that surround
us, especially with weak souls
like me. I envy those men who are
as gods, in spite of temperament, or
clime, or any outward influence; who
go on unchecked from one degree
of glory to another, to the very
heights of sanctity. I am always
drifting along, awaiting the impulse
of the sacraments, or the helping
hand of some stronger friend, too
glad if I do not recede. Ah! solitude
brings us face to face with ourselves,
and reveals to us our <em>moral
littleness</em>. Nothing is more humbling
than this revelation. Nothing
makes us more distrustful of ourselves,
and more willing to accept the
appointed means of perfection. The
life our director thinks the safest is a
common life, lived in an <em>uncommon</em>
manner; that is, while we do the
same things as those around us, it is
with motives so holy that each action
is rendered in a degree supernatural.
This is the great secret of the hidden
and interior life, which the saints of
all ages have loved and of which St.
Joseph is the type.</p>

<p>I have been reading <i>Fioretti; or,
the Little Flowers of St. Francis
d'Assisi</i>&mdash;a collection of the sayings
of the first Franciscans, with a rare
bloom on them. These mediæval
flowers, so long shut up in a foreign
tongue, have a delicious fragrance,
and while I inhaled their odor I forgot
that I belonged to an incredulous
age. There is a simplicity truly poetical
in this collection, which is admirable.
One little remark of Friar
Egide struck me: "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La voie la plus
directe pour nous sauver, c'est de nous
perdre.</i>" This loss, this annihilation
of self, on the ruins of which must be
built up the great edifice of our perfection,
is what I daily sigh after, and
what I ask for you. The Père Milley,
a Jesuit, speaks much of "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le pays
des âmes perdues</i>"&mdash;a country to
which all my desires tend. It is a
promised land which I see afar off;
another Canaan, which I hardly dare
hope to enter, though I look wistfully
on those who are lost in God&mdash;that
ocean without limit, where our littleness
is swallowed up in immensity,
and we almost forget our fears and
our frailties; we know not whether
we suffer or are consoled; conscious
only of the divine atmosphere&mdash;conscious
only that we love!...</p>

<p>Our novitiate is a large apartment
with five immense windows in it.
(When you are taxed for windows,
you may as well have large ones,
and the French love the air and live
in it.) No matter how cold it is,
the windows are always open&mdash;and
when I say <em>open</em>, I mean the <em>whole</em>
window; for, as I have already remarked,
they swing open like folding
doors. On cold days a few
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mottes</i> are burning in the fireplace,
around which a folding screen is
drawn. These mottes are mostly
of tan, pressed into flat round cakes
like a small cheese. They give out
strong heat. Wood is very scarce
here, and consequently dear, and I
have never seen coal. As for lights,
we burn linseed-oil, which gives a
clear yellow light, and the odor is
not offensive like whale-oil. Each
sister has a little coil of yellow wax-taper
to light when she wishes to go
about the monastery in the evening.</p>

<p>The floor is paved with square red
tiles, as in all the houses here, but
we have little mats to protect our
feet from the chill. Each novice has
her table and writing-desk, at which
she studies or sews. At one end of
the room is an altar, and the walls are
adorned with engravings of a religious
character. Leading from the
novitiate is the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chambrette</i> of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
mistress of novices, in which is the
novices' library. It is always open
to us, and we like an excuse for entering
it.</p>

<p>Our manner of spending the day
is nearly unvaried. We rise at half-past
four, and, after completing our
toilettes, (for even nuns have toilettes;
one's garments must be put
together somehow,) we descend to
the chapel. The choir is impenetrably
dark most of the year at this
early hour. Only the little lamp is
twinkling near the tabernacle! One
by one the nuns come noiselessly in,
like so many shadows. This hour of
morning meditation is delicious. The
perfect stillness, in which you can hear
your own heart beat, disposes you to
reflection. The soul becomes steeped
in the spirit of the place and the
hour passes too quickly away. Then
we say the hours. The morning
sacrifice follows with its awful mysteries,
which are ever fresh and wonderful.</p>

<p>When we issue from the chapel,
after our exercises of more than two
hours, we go one by one, when we
choose, to the refectory, for there is
no breakfast, properly speaking. The
nuns take a piece of dry bread, with
perchance some fruit, and eat it, as
the children of Israel ate the passover,
standing and ready girded for
the labors of the day, for which we
are all ready at eight. That would
be called a fast in America. But
when a sister is delicate, she can have
some coffee or chocolate. The world
used to cry out against the good living
of monastic orders; now it says
their austerities are fatal to the health.
It is always the way with the world&mdash;now,
as in the days when John the
Baptist came "neither eating nor
drinking."</p>

<p>The French know nothing of the
cup that cheers but does not inebriate.
They only take tea medicinally,
and seem to have no idea of
how it should be prepared. It
is a prevalent belief here that every
Englishman in his travels carries his
tea-kettle with him, and they suppose
the whole race partial to the
beverage. So, by way of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</i>, they
proposed regaling me with some the
other day. I accepted what was no
luxury to me. A good sister brought
me what she styled <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soupe au thé</i>, consisting
of an abundance of milk and
water, with a dash of tea. (I rely
on the veracity of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cuisinière</i> for
this last item.) Into this, bread was
sliced, and the whole served up in a
soup-plate! Confucius himself would
have laughed. I am sure I did till I
cried, to the great scandal of all the
nuns, who were gravely listening to
some holy legend as they ate. Shall
I tell you what I did with my <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soupe
au thé</i>? I hope I am not vain of
the heroic act, but I&mdash;ate it!</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes before dinner we
have examination of conscience. We
go to the table saying, "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">De profundis
clamavi</i>" and leave it reciting,
"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Miserere Domine!</i>" We eat in silence,
listening to the gospel of the
day, the lives of the saints, or some
other religious book, read by one of
the sisters from a high pulpit. After
dinner is a reunion, when we come
together with our sewing or other
handiwork, and have the privilege of
talking, and sometimes we make <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la
cour du roi Pétaud</i>, I assure you. At
one o'clock the lay sisters come in,
while we read aloud for half an hour,
if no chapter has been convoked.
They too bring their work. One old
sister always brings her spindle and
distaff, and twirls away, sitting bolt
upright, and looking so grim that
she always seems to me one of the
Fates lengthening out the thread of
life. At three we have vespers, and
then make half an hour's meditation.
From compline we go to supper at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
six, after which we walk in the garden
or assemble together within doors.
At eight o'clock is read the subject
for the next morning's meditation,
and we go to the choir to say the
office, and for night prayers. Thus
closes the day with prayer, as it began.
We all light our little tapers
and go silently to our cells for the
night. Such is the outline of our life,
which is so well filled up that we
have few leisure moments. We hear
of lazy monks and nuns, but there
are no drones in our busy hive, with
our boarding-school, day and free
schools, with their hundreds of pupils,
and this vast building to keep in
order. Night comes before we know
it, and another day is gone. There
is one day less in which to struggle
with self, and, alas! one day less in
which to sacrifice something for
God! You ask for the shadow in
the picture of my life. There is ever
one dark spot in our existence, the
shadow of ourselves, which follows us
wherever we go.</p>

<p>But we have one grievance just
now. <i>Finisterre</i> is the name of the
portal that separates us from the
world, but it cannot wholly exclude
its sounds. I will explain. The
city rises so abruptly behind our
monastery that the garden of the
Count de T&mdash;&mdash;, on the opposite side
of the street, is on a level with our
second story. And the street that
separates us is one of those dim, narrow
streets found only in old cities of
the south, where it is desirable to exclude
the heat. For several nights
past when we have come from our
dear quiet chapel, with our hearts all
subdued and thoughtful, and pondering
on the subject for the next morning's
meditation, a "<i>toot, tooting</i>," is
heard from the garden opposite that
is enough to distract a saint. It is a
French horn, or some other wind
instrument, surely meant for some
vast campagna. But, essayed in a
small garden, with a hill in the rear
to aid the reverberation, the whole
volume of sound comes pouring
across the corridor into our cells, the
very embodiment of worldly discord
and tumult. "<em>Pazienza!</em>" we say to
ourselves, and try to turn a deaf ear.
I dare say the performer has some
idea of enlivening the poor recluses,
who have no other wish but to be
left to their own reveries, save that
the time of the vintage may soon
come when he can awaken the echoes
of the vineyard.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is the festival of the Assumption.
While I write, all the bells of the city
are ringing, statues and banners of
Mary are borne through the streets
by the clergy, followed by a long
procession of people. The deep-toned
"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ora pro nobis</i>" breaks in
upon the stilly air. Each invocation
seems like a cry of agony, which
goes heavenward from hearts weary
of the world and the things of the
world. These processions are made
throughout France in memory of
the celebrated vow of Louis XIII.,
who consecrated France to the Virgin.
It is also a national holiday in
honor of Napoleon I., being his birthday.
"St. Napoleon's Day," say the
people with a smile!</p>

<p>I saw a pretty picture last evening&mdash;Sister
Rose standing on a stool near
the fountain of the court, surrounded
by a group of gay young ladies, to
whom she was preaching. She looked
like a statue of St. Angèle. Sister
Rose is a lay sister, wholly uneducated,
but with a certain piety of a
mystical nature which has given her
quite a reputation for sanctity. She
has an oval face of pale olive hue, jet
black eyes with an indrawn look as
if conscious of some interior Presence,
and regular features, with a delicacy
and refinement quite remarkable considering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
her laborious life. She never
meets you without a smile and a
"word for Jesus," as she says. The
young ladies of the boarding-school
love and revere her so much that they
often lay violent hands upon her and
force her to preach to them, which
she does with a smile and the same
inward look, and with a grace of gesture
peculiar to her country. As her
discourse was in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">patois</i>, (one of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">langues d'Oc</i>, and the tongue of Jasmin,
who lives at Agen,) which all
understand here, I was not benefited
thereby; but her appearance and her
saintly face, with its gentle, serious
smile, were impressive. The exuberance
of her audience was soon
subdued.</p>

<p>There are a good many Spaniards
in this city who are exiled on account
of their political opinions, being
Carlists. They had a solemn mass
of requiem chanted in our chapel, the
other day, for the repose of the soul
of Don Carlos. Nearly thirty Spanish
gentlemen and some ladies were present.
A bier was placed in the centre
of the chapel and surrounded by
lights, as if the body were there, and
on the pall was placed a wreath of
laurel. The officiating priest, too, was
a Spaniard. I looked with interest
on these exiles from their native land,
and my heart grew warm toward
them; they were extremely devout
during mass, and I saw many of
them wipe away their fast-falling
tears. I could not repress my own;
for separation from the fatherland
seemed a bond of sympathy I could
not resist. Thus, when I am gone,
and my remains lie in a foreign land,
may some kind souls gather together
in the sanctuary of God to chant the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Requiem æternam</i> for my tried soul!</p>

<p>Once a month we meditate particularly
on death, and offer all our
devotions as a preparation for our last
end. When mass is over, and the
thanksgiving for our communion is
ended&mdash;no, not ended, for it can
never end; but while it is still ascending
from our hearts, our dear mère,
who is as pale as the wife of Seneca,
goes forward and kneels before the
grate that separates the choir from
the chancel, and says in earnest tones
the litany for a happy death. Her
voice trembles as she repeats the awful
petition: "When my eyes, obscured
at the approach of death, cast their
dying looks toward thee, O merciful
Jesus! and when my lips, cold and
trembling, pronounce for the last
time on earth thy adorable name&mdash;"
"Merciful Jesus, have pity on me!"
sighs every heart in response. The
impression of these prayers pursues
the mind all day. "Lord, in that
strait, the Judge! remember me!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On St. Andrew's day we buried
one of the nuns, who was about
ninety years of age and quite superannuated.
This death did not affect
me so much as that of Sister Sophie.
The transition from old age to the
grave seems so natural that it excites
less horror than when one dies in the
full vigor of life. Mère Ste. Ursule
was of a noble family of La Vendée.
At the age of sixteen she entered a
community of Poor Clares, one of
the most rigid orders of the church;
but, during her novitiate, the great
French Revolution swept away nearly
every vestige of religion, and the
nuns of St. Clare were driven out
from their quiet cells into the world.
When the <i>gendarmes</i> forced them to
leave the convent, these emissaries
desecrated every thing and broke and
threw out the sacred emblems. As
Sister Ursule, who had a most tender
devotion to her whom Châteaubriand
styles "the divinity of the frail and
the desolate," was leaving the cloister
she had loved so much, she turned
to give it a last look, and saw a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
small statue of Notre Dame de
Grâce standing on the convent wall.
She said to one of her sister nuns,
"It seems as if the Blessed Virgin reproaches
me for leaving," and she turned
back to save the statue from insult.
The <i>gendarmes</i> did not oppose the
design of the young novice, and this
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonne Vierge</i> was for more than sixty
years the ornament and tutelary genius
of the cell of Mère Ste. Ursule,
after her re-entrance into religion.
With all the fervor of southern devotion
toward Mary, she used to prostrate
herself daily before this statuette,
and when fallen into second childhood
she would pour out her heart in
effusions of child-like simplicity at
once charming and poetic. She often
said to her novices: "When I am
dying, place my <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonne Vierge</i> on my
bed beside me."</p>

<p>After the Revolution, the more
rigid orders were not restored, and
Mère Ste. Ursule, despairing of the
re-establishment of the Poor Clares,
joined the Ursulines, and was for a
long time mistress of novices at the
priory. In her last days she did
nothing but pray and adorn the altar
in her cell. She knew the office by
heart, and always recited it at the
canonical hours. Her beads were
told many times a day, and she
never failed to use the discipline with
severity. I often went to see her and
her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonne Vierge</i>. She died suddenly
of old age. Being somewhat more
feeble than usual, one of the sisters
remained with her during the night.
Mère Ste. Ursule said her office and
rosary, but did not sleep. Toward
day the sister perceived the approach
of death; she took down the statue
of Notre Dame de Grâce and laid it
in the arms of the aged nun, whose
spirit instantly fled to the presence of
Mary in heaven. It was at the hour
of dawn. The first beam of the dayspring
from on high carried her soul
away from earth.</p>

<p>Again those solemn funeral services!
I cannot tell you the effect
they have on me.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A friend sent me a curious pear to-day,
said to be peculiar to this city.
It is called the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bon Chrétien</i>, but
very different from the one we called
so at home. It is a large, coarse-grained
pear, but juicy and toothsome,
and has no seeds; that is, as
every one says, those that grow
within the limits of the city have
none, while those that are found in
the country are seedy enough. Old
legends connect this peculiarity with
St. Oren's miraculous powers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>December 8.</i>&mdash;This is the festival
of the Immaculate Conception, the
patronal feast of the chapel of the
priory. For nine days past the convent
bell has rung out a joyful peal
at the hour of the novena to Maria
Immaculata, when her litany was
chanted to a beautiful Spanish air
which completely melts the heart.
Unusual pomp has been given to
this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</i> on account of the expected
decision respecting the dogma of the
Immaculate Conception at Rome.
This morning we had more than a
dozen masses, for the clergy love to
come to this antique chapel on the
feasts of Mary. At ten o'clock, about
twenty priests came to sing high
mass, and again this afternoon for
vespers. The chapel was crowded
with people from the city. Thus for
centuries have the faithful congregated
on this same day. The Blessed
Sacrament was exposed all day. I
passed hours in its presence, bearing
in my heart all my innumerable
wants, and those of my friends afar
off. How like heaven is our dear
chapel when the Lamb of God is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
thus exposed to our adoration! In a
niche over the altar gleams the holy
image of Mary. The Divinity is enshrined
in light beneath her maternal
eye, the air filled with incense,
as if fanned by adoring angels. The
arches are full of harmony. Every
power of body and mind is captivated,
and one abandons one's self to the
impressions of the moment. It gives
one a peculiar emotion to hear men
chant the praises of Mary. What a
reverence they must have for womanhood!
Their <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Miserere nobis</i> in the
litany was the very cry of a contrite
heart. I should have thought myself
in paradise had not the supplicatory
tones of the clergy announced a
felicity still imperfect.</p>

<p>All this is infinitely beautiful and
poetic, apart from every sentiment of
religion. Every day of my life would
seem to you a chapter full of poetry;
but I have become so accustomed to
what I once thought belonged to
a bygone age of mystery and romance,
that it all seems the natural
order of events. And one soon
learns to rise above the mere ceremonials
of religion, which are so full of
enjoyment to some natures, to that
which they typify. Such is the design
of Holy Church&mdash;to lead the
heart up to God, its true centre.
Perhaps, too, she wishes that every
power of our being should be enlisted
in his service; the imagination as well
as reason.</p>

<p>After vespers we had a fine sermon
from the Abbé Lassale upon the
invocation: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Regina sine labe concepta,
ora pro nobis!</i> It is the custom here
now, as, from the sermons of Bossuet,
we see it was in the time of Louis
XIV., for the preacher, after invoking
the Holy Spirit, to present a plan
of his discourse, make some introductory
remarks, and then stop. Both
preacher and audience kneel in silence
for the space of an Ave Maria,
then all rise and the sermon is continued.
The custom is quite impressive.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>December 15.</i>&mdash;Owing to the antiquity
of our chapel, long since dedicated
to the mystery of the Immaculate Conception,
the archbishop permitted us,
as a particular favor, to celebrate the
octave of this great festival of Mary
with a sermon and benediction every
evening. The whole chapel was daily
illuminated, and the effect was magical
when it was lighted up. Imagine
arches of light, pillars wreathed in
flame, altar covered with flowers and
brilliant with immense wax candles;
while in the midst gleamed the Virgin
in a perfect bower of pure white
lilies. And, just as the imagination
is fired with so much brilliancy and
taste, <i>Kyrie eleison!</i> floats up with the
incense in the most plaintive, heart-rending
tones&mdash;a very tear of the
heart dropped at the feet of Mary!
It is the commencement of the litany
of Maria Immaculata, chanted by
the nuns in choir, and responded to by
the crowds that fill the chapel without.
Light and music are the two ideas
of which Dante's Paradise is composed;
and I felt with what true poetic
instinct, when kneeling before that
shrine of light, my ears listened to
harmonies approaching those that
swell for ever before the throne of
God! This struck me from the first;
and I have since found my thoughts
expressed by another far better than I
could express them. Leigh Hunt says:
"It is impossible to see this profusion
of lights, especially when one knows
their symbolical meaning, without
being struck with the source from
which Dante took his idea of the
beatified spirits. His heaven, filled
with lights, and lights, too, arranged
in figures, which glow with lustre in
proportion to the beatitude of the
souls within them, is the sublimation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of a Catholic church. And so far it is
heavenly indeed; for nothing escapes
the look of materiality like fire. It is
so airy, joyous, and divine a thing,
when separated from the idea of pain
and an ill purpose, that the language
of happiness naturally adopts its terms,
and can tell of nothing more rapturous
than burning bosoms and sparkling
eyes. The seraph of the Hebrew
theology was a fire."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Christmas.</i>&mdash;Yesterday was spent
in retreat, by way of preparing our
hearts for the solemnities of the nativity;
and I have kept a real old-fashioned
vigil&mdash;a vigil of the middle
ages. I wish you could have heard
the joyful ring of all the bells of the
city as midnight approached. At
the cathedral, the clear tones of the
smaller bells, like the voices of nuns
in choir, and the great Bourdon
among them, "like the chanting of
a friar," as Longfellow says; the <i>carillon</i>,
too, from St. Pierre; and then
all the convent bells sounding from
Carmel, the Oratory, the Filles de
Marie, and La Miséricorde, and those
of the Hospital, Le Grand Séminaire,
etc., etc., are infinitely impressive in
the stillness of the night&mdash;the prelude
of a great joy, breaking in upon our
meditation on the birth of Christ.
When the bells were all hushed, the
priest stood at the foot of the blazing
altar; all the rest of the chapel was
in darkness&mdash;not a taper in the choir.
There was not a sound but the night
wind. The saints on the walls, half
revealed in their dim recesses, looked
like the spirits of the old monks
come forth at this mystic hour to
guard the chapel their hands once
raised.</p>

<p>It was the second time I ever
communicated at midnight mass, and
I imagined my heart the manger in
which the Infant Jesus came to repose.
I thought, as I returned from
the holy table to my <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">prie-dieu</i>, of the
first tears of the Divine Babe, and that
he bewailed my continued imperfections.
"Ah! why should not thy
tears," I exclaimed, "wash away my
sins, that thou be not forced to shed
also thy most precious blood! I, too,
weep. I, who deserve to weep, join
my tears to thine. O Virgin Mother!
take back thy child! His presence
makes me an object of horror
to myself. His tears scald my very
heart. His caresses are like arrows
that pierce my soul. Thou alone
canst console him; only clean hands
and a pure heart should embrace
spotless innocence. My spiritual vision
is too weak to bear the Orient
from on high. Yes, Mary, thou
alone canst console him; for thou art
immaculate. Embrace him for me&mdash;those
hands and feet which will be
pierced for me; and wipe away the
tears that have commenced to flow
but too soon."</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh! blissful and calm was the wondrous rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou gavest thy God in thy virginal breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the heaven he left he found heaven in thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he shone in thy shining, sweet Star of the sea!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After hearing three masses, we
went to visit the manger. A kind
of tent had been erected in the upper
choir. In it was a statue of St. Joseph,
the Blessed Virgin, an ox, an
ass, and in the centre on the straw
lay the new-born Infant with its little
arms outstretched. Above hovered
the angels. Though rudely cast,
their effect was good in the dim light.
We knelt around, and the novices
sang out joyfully a Christmas carol,
the chorus of which was "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jésus est
né!</i>"&mdash;Christ is born! All this gave a
certain vividness to the festival which
it never had before; and I enjoyed it
much. True, our manger is too
homely to bear the criticisms of the
scoffer. St. Joseph, for a carpenter,
is rather gaudily dressed out in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
scarlet robe, purple mantle, ruffle-bosomed
shirt, with a breast-pin; and
the Virgin hardly does credit to her
reputation for beauty and grace; but
the eye of faith looks beyond and
reads only the lesson of child-like
simplicity and humility&mdash;nowhere so
well learned as at Bethlehem.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I adore thee, O Infant Jesus! naked,
weeping, and lying in the manger. Thy
childhood and poverty are become my delight.
Oh! that I could be thus poor, thus a
child like thee. O eternal wisdom! reduced
to the condition of a little babe, take from
me the vanity and presumptuousness of human
wisdom! Make me a child with thee.
Be silent, ye teachers and sages of the
earth! I wish to know nothing but to be
resigned, to be willing to suffer, to lose and
forsake all, to be all faith! The Word made
Flesh! now <em>is</em> silent, now has an imperfect
utterance, now weeps as a child! And shall
I set up for being wise? Shall I take a
complacency in my own schemes and systems?
Shall I be afraid lest the world
should not have an opinion high enough of
my capacity? No, no; all my pleasure
shall be to <em>decrease</em>&mdash;to become little and
obscure, to live in silence, to bear the reproach
of Jesus crucified, and to add thereto
the helplessness and imperfect utterance
of Jesus, a child."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The manger remains till Epiphany.
It is gotten up by the scholars, who
delight in it, especially the younger
ones, who go to present the Infant
Jesus with fruit, nuts, <i>bonbons</i>, money,
and whatever their childish hearts
suggest. These things are for the
Holy Infant in the person of poor
children among whom they are distributed,
that they too may have
some pleasure at Christmas-tide. I
find it a pretty custom, as well as
beneficial; for piety should not all
evaporate in sentiment, but, even in
children, ought to be embodied in
some good deed, or prompt to some
act of self-denial. The children of
France take much pleasure in making
little sacrifices of pocket-money
(not in the spirit of Mrs. Pardiggle's
unfortunate children!) for the association
of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sainte Enfance</i>, the funds
of which are destined to rescue hundreds
of little children, who are exposed
to death in China by their parents,
and even to buy those who are
exposed for sale, that they may be
reared as Christians. Last year, four
hundred thousand children were thus
baptized&mdash;an angelic work, worthy of
young and pure hearts. Our scholars
embroider collars and do a variety of
fancy work for a fair among themselves,
by which they amass quite a
sum in the course of the year. The
French children are exceedingly volatile,
but there is a great deal of
piety among them. During Passion-time
a little girl of nine or ten, belonging
to the poor scholars, undertook
to meditate fifteen minutes a
day, for a certain number of days,
on the sufferings of Christ. One of
the nuns asked her how she employed
the time, so long for a child. She
replied, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïvement</i>, "I thought each
thorn that pierced the head of Christ
was one of my sins!"</p>

<p>After our nocturnal devotions, we
novices returned to the novitiate,
where the Yule log was blazing. By
way of a rarity, we all had coffee to
refresh us after our vigil, and we sat
around the fire chatting in a home-like
manner, and repeating Christmas
carols.</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"He neither shall be born<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>In the country, on Christmas eve,
the young peasants go about from
house to house, singing Christmas
carols, expecting some treat in return.</p>

<p>I saw to-day a little picture of the
Child Jesus making crosses in the
work-shop of his foster-father. Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
it was one of these that the
poets tell us the little St. John contended
for:</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Give me the cross, I pray you, dearest Jesus!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! if you knew how much I wish to have it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You would not hold it in your hand so tightly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Something has told me, something in my breast here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which I am sure is true, that if you keep it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you will let no other take it from you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Terrible things I cannot bear to think of<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must fall upon you. Show me that you love me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Am I not here to be your little servant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Follow your steps and wait upon your wishes?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At four o'clock in the morning we
returned to the choir. I stationed
myself before the manger to make
my meditation on the mystery of the
day. Of course Christmas is not
very merry after such a vigil, but
who can tell the holy joy of such a
night&mdash;worth all the gayeties of the
world!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I read in the refectory for the first
time to-day. When I returned to
the novitiate after my dinner the
good mother said, "You have read
so well, you merit a recompense." I
glanced at the mantel and saw the
American stamps with the benign
faces of Washington and Franklin,
so welcome in this far-off land....</p>

<p>I hope you will never speak of
burdening me with an account of
your infirmities, whether bodily or
spiritual. I love that loving command
of the apostle, to bear one another's
burdens; for we are never
more Christ-like than when we forget
our own trials to bind up the wounds
of a fellow-sufferer. Be assured I
pray for you without ceasing. I
never enter the presence of the Blessed
Sacrament without invoking a
blessing on you and on my dear
country. I never communicate or
perform an act of penance without
desiring that you may participate in
the grace I receive. Oh! that by my
fidelity to God I might draw down
the blessings I daily implore for you
and for all who are dear to me! O
my God! spare me not. Let <em>me</em>
suffer mental and bodily trials, let
<em>me</em> be the victim of thy justice; but
spare my loved ones! If I cannot
labor <em>directly</em> for thee, I can at least
suffer for thee, for them, and for the
whole world. Thy victim, O God!
thy victim. The name befits me better
than that of thy spouse.</p>

<p>I have read somewhere that the
ropes in the English navy are so
twisted that a red thread runs through
them all, in such a way that the
smallest pieces may be recognized as
belonging to the crown. So through
our lives should run a thread, coloring
its whole woof&mdash;a love for God
interwoven with the very thread of
existence, and inspiring every act of
our lives. St. Francis de Sales said
if he knew that the least fibre of his
heart did not beat with love for God
he would pluck it out. O love that
transcends all others! how did we
once exist without thee? O days
without a sun! O nights rayless and
dark! how happy are we who have
escaped from your gloom! How
different is the divine friend from our
earthly one. When once we have
studied a person and penetrated his
individuality, the charm of his presence
is gone. We have squeezed
him dry. But the friend that sticketh
closer than a brother, he is unfathomable
and ever new. The heart
is never weary of divine companionship.
On the contrary, the more completely
we give ourselves up to it, to
the exclusion of every other, the more
we feel that <em>God alone</em> can satisfy the
cravings of our hearts.</p>

<p><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dieu seul</i> was the device a holy
American bishop gave me on the day

upon me ever since. They have
expanded till they have filled the
whole heavens, and lit up my life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
with wondrous splendor. There is
no spot on my horizon where they
do not shine out. Every object unmarked
by them seems to fade out of
view. All knowledge, all science
grows pale before their significance,
and every wound of the heart finds a
balm in their healing ray. "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Paix!

<p><i>February.</i>&mdash;The day on which
Pius IX. added the crowning star of
immaculate purity to the coronet of
Mary was the cause of great rejoicing
throughout France. All the principal
cities have been illuminated.
At Toulouse, the sides and roof of
St. Saturnin's cathedral were covered
with lights, and another church had
fifteen thousand lamps upon it.
Ours was not least among the cities
in her joy, and it did the soul good to
witness such a display of Catholic
piety and enthusiasm, worthy of the
ages of faith. As soon as the bull
of promulgation arrived from Rome,
Monseigneur ordered the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te Deum</i> to
be chanted with the utmost pomp
in all the churches of the diocese.
The same evening the whole city was
illuminated. Nothing had been seen
like it since the visit of Napoleon I.
to this city. At the grand portal of
the priory were several hundred
lamps, forming a monogram of Mary,
over a beautiful transparency of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vierge Immaculée</i>. The belfry, tower,
and all the windows of this immense
establishment were lighted up, and
many windows were like chapels of
the Virgin all aflame. The top of
the convent walls was one long line
of light, so closely were the lamps
placed upon it. Pennons with the
colors of the Virgin were placed at
uniform distances among these lights,
and one floated from the stone cross
on the chapel. The whole scene was
magical. From the tower we could
see much of the city, which was so
universally illuminated and adorned
that it looked like that city of jewels</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In fairy land whose streets and towers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are made of gems, and lights, and flowers."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>All was so still that no one would
have suspected the intense enthusiasm
that reigned in every heart. Only
from before a little statue of the
Madonna, in the convent garden, rose
a sweet song to the Virgin, Ave
Sanctissima! which floated up through
the damp night air from the lips of the
spouses of Christ with a sound as
plaintive as the voice of past times.</p>

<p>Even the poorest people in the
city&mdash;and you know not how poor
are the poorest in this old country&mdash;had
their candles and a picture of the
Virgin at the window. One poor
woman begged enough to buy a wax
candle, which she cut in three pieces
to light up her wretched abode.
The towers of the cathedral looked
like the jewelled turrets of Irim. All
the public buildings were also lighted
up. I wonder when the civil authorities
of the United States will order a
general illumination in honor of the
Virgin Mary! On the top of the
hospital was a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vierge en feu</i>. Even
one window of the prison tower,
which looms up behind the cathedral&mdash;a
huge quadrangular monument,
dark and forbidding as a donjon
keep of ages past&mdash;was brilliant with
lights, while far up in the very
highest window gleamed one bright
solitary lamp, like the last ray of hope
in the heart of the captive. That
light pierced me to the heart.</p>

<p>And all this in honor of a once
obscure virgin of Judea. One can well
sing "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Exaltavit humiles</i>." In the streets
were arches of triumph, and at most
of the windows were Madonnas,
crosses, monograms, flags, etc., etc.
The streets were crowded with people
as on Holy Thursday, for every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
body went to visit the different
churches and monasteries, and thousands
came in from the country.
But all were so quiet and thoughtful
that one felt it was a religious festival.
The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rue du Prieuré</i> was crammed,
but so subdued were the voices that
we should hardly have been aware
of it, had we not seen the people
from the grated windows above.
Such thoughtfulness was truly edifying.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Holy Week has just passed again
with its touching ceremonies, which
recall so many overwhelming mysteries
of faith. What a feast for the
soul on Maunday Thursday, when
the Divine Host remained all day
and night on the altar amid a blaze
of lights, and the perfume of flowers
and incense, exposed to the eyes of
his adorers! Who could tear himself
away from that altar? Who
could hunger after earthly aliment
when that Living Bread was replenishing
the hungry soul? Ah! what
are the pleasures of the world compared
with those found in thy
presence, O Incarnate Word! I
read the fourteenth chapter of St.
John's Gospel, those tender words
of our Saviour before his crucifixion,
and meditated on them for hours.</p>

<p>Many of the nuns remained all
night before the Blessed Sacrament.
We novices made the holy hour
together&mdash;that midnight hour of union
with the Saviour's agony in the garden.
"Couldst thou not watch one
hour with me," he seemed to say.
Such an hour is an eternity for the
heart that loves.</p>

<p>"O God!" I say constantly, "the
Catholic Church alone knows how to
honor thee with due worship." I
wish I could define all the emotions
of the past few days, when the sufferings
of Christ were renewed in our
hearts. I thought my very heart would
break on Holy Thursday during the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Stabat Mater</i>. The words and the
music are the very embodiment of
sorrow, and I felt myself with Mary
at the foot of the cross, sharing the
pain from that sword of grief.</p>

<p>The ceremonies of this holy time
are, of course, far more simple in our
chapel than at the cathedral, but
perhaps not less touching. Nothing
could be more so than, at the veneration
of the cross on Good Friday,
to see the long train of nuns
reverently lay off their shoes, and, all
enveloped in their long black veils,
and bowed down by sorrow of heart,
approach the crucifix, prostrating
themselves to kiss the sacred wounds;
and then the three hours agony,
when the heart is full of anguish on
Calvary.... Several of us remained
a part of Good Friday night to grieve
with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marie désolée</i> over the traces of
her crucified Son. There is a whole
existence in such days and nights, and
when we come back to ordinary life
we are oppressed by the heaviness of
the atmosphere.</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"How shall we breathe in other air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Less pure, accustomed to immortal fruits?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Our whole Lent was uncommonly
solemn. I never entered so fully
into the spirit of the church, never
meditated so much on the sufferings
of Christ. They so occupied my
mind during the hours of meditation,
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">via crucis</i>, which we make so
often, and even during the ordinary
duties of our life, that I felt bowed
down by a weight of inexpressible
sorrow, which the alleluias of Easter
and the joyful "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Regina C&oelig;li lætare</i>"
have hardly dissipated. Oh! why are
you not sharing all these impressions?
But then you have what
perhaps is better&mdash;the cross, which
is our portion everywhere. "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Souffrir
et mourir, c'est toute la vie.</i>"</p>

<p>I was struck with a little picture I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
saw to-day: the picture of a cross
with cords extending from one of
the arms to the foot, like a harp. A
person stands leaning on it, his hands
touching the strings; and our Saviour
was near him; his holy hands <ins title="Original reads 'unlifted'">uplifted</ins>
to bless. Every cross would thus
be to us a divine lyre with a capability
of wonderful harmony, had we
the courage to learn to draw it forth.
May my hand yet acquire the skill
of producing this heavenly music,
my ears quick to catch the vibrations
of this wonderful instrument, and my
soul attuned to its harmony! O wonderful
science of the cross! how
varied are the lessons the loving
heart may learn therefrom. When
St. Thomas of Aquin was asked
whence he drew the inspiration that
fed his wonderful genius, he pointed
to his crucifix as its only source.
Ah! could we only learn to know
"Jesus Christ and him crucified!"
May you have the grace to bear your
cross with patience, and learn therefrom
its wonderful lore. The cross
imposed by Almighty God is far
more meritorious, far more beneficial to
our souls, than any of our own choice;
for he alone knows how to crucify.
I constantly feel this more and more,
that <em>he alone</em> knows how to crucify.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>May 11.</i>&mdash;This is one of the Rogation
days. Curé and flock go in procession
around the country chanting
the Litany of the Saints to implore
the blessing of God on the fruits of
the earth. At these times the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">propriétaires</i>
erect huge crosses on their
land by the highway, adorn them
with garlands, and place at the foot
an offering for the curé, perhaps of
provisions. The procession passes
from one cross to another. All kneel
around the emblem of our salvation
to beg the divine blessing on the basket
and store of him who erected it.
It is a beautiful ceremony, at which
the peasantry assist with great faith
and devotion. It is an expression of
dependence on the Giver of all good
for every blessing.</p>

<p>Thursday will be the feast of the Ascension.
The paschal candle, in whose
sacred light we have loved to linger
since Easter, is again to be extinguished,
and the ten succeeding days
we are to pass in retreat and prayer,
like the disciples in the upper chamber
awaiting the feast of Pentecost.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>June.</i>&mdash;Yesterday I had been writing
for some time in my cell, when I
heard an unusual bustle of nuns going
to and fro in the long corridors, as if
something had happened. Going to
the window, I saw the river had risen
to an alarming height. An inundation
was expected, owing to the sudden
melting of snow in the Pyrenees.
We all went to clear the chapel. A
priest came to transport the blessed
sacrament to the upper choir. The
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">quais</i> were crowded with spectators,
and the <i>gendarmes</i> were among
them keeping order. Masseube is
said to be under water. Several of
the nuns watched all night. This
morning less danger is apprehended,
though the river is very high, and the
water is coming into the chapel. "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le
bon Dieu est irrité contre nous</i>," say
the nuns, as they tell their beads to
deprecate the wrath of Heaven. Every
thing is depressing to-day. Dark
clouds hang over us heavy with rain.
The cathedral bell is tolling for some
funeral. The trees seem to shiver in
the winds that come cold from the
snowy Pyrenees. And the dying-away
tones of some chant afar off is
the very voice of sorrow, and only
adds to the impressive gloom.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On Trinity Sunday, the whole
country was inundated in the valleys
of the Garonne, the Adour, and the
Gers, causing an immense loss of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
property. Such a flood has not been
known for a hundred years. Some
villages are nearly destroyed, many
lives lost, the produce of the farms
all washed away, and the meadows
nearly ruined. The whole country
was in consternation. As we are on
the banks of the river, we are sufferers
of course. It was fortunate we
had the precaution to have the blessed
sacrament transported to the upper
choir, as the next morning there
were six or eight feet of water in the
chapel, lower choir, and sacristy. It
was pitiful to look down from the
upper choir on the sanctuary. Notre
Dame de Bon Secours was washed
down from her niche into the middle
of the church, and lay floating on the
water flat on her back. The garden
was overflowed and nearly ruined;
the kitchen, refectory, etc., were invaded.
Most of the nuns were up
all night carrying things into the second
story. All was confusion for
some days. We ate what we could
and where we could in primitive
style&mdash;a complete subversion of monastic
regularity. The weather had
been gloomy for days, but Sunday
was one of the brightest, clearest
days of June. I went to the tower
to see the whole valley covered with
water. The effect was fine. The
vast expanse of water was sparkling
in the sun. The trees and groves
were like islets in the midst of a glittering
lake. The rapid current swept
oceanward, carrying down houses,
furniture, bridges&mdash;every thing that
offered resistance. Crowds of people
were out, giving animation to the
scene. All this brilliancy was in
striking contrast with the wretchedness
produced by such a flood! The
air was so clear that the Pyrenees
seemed very near us, and they gleamed
in their snow-clad summits above
the verdure and desolation and activity
of the world, like the Bride of
Heaven in her veil of purity; but
they looked cold and cheerless even
in the morning sun&mdash;and so near heaven!</p>

<p>At Condom, (a village not far off,
and remarkable for nothing but that
Bossuet was its bishop before he was
transferred to Meaux, though he
never saw the place,) at Condom
more than thirty houses were destroyed&mdash;a
great number, considering that
all the houses here are of stone and
very solidly built. Had not our
monastery been on a strong foundation,
we should now be uncloistered.
The chapel is not yet dry, so we have
mass still in the upper choir. We
are thus brought close to the feet of
our Lord. During the office I stand
or kneel not two steps from the altar
on which is the tabernacle. What
bliss! We seem more closely united
to Him who is our life, our consolation,
our <em>all</em>, and for whom we
have left all!</p>

<p>Having mass in the choir obliges
the priest to enter the cloister every
morning, which seems strange, as ordinarily
he never enters except to administer
the consolations of religion to
the sick. The cloister is very strict here.
Our parlors have the blackest of grates,
beyond which no visitor comes, and
through which we talk to our friends.
I love this barricade against the
world, which says, "Thus far shalt
thou come, and no farther." There is
also a grating in the sacristy through
which the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sacristaine</i> can attend to
the wants of the chaplain. Even the
choir is separated from the chapel by
a grate; the body of the church being
for the world.</p>

<p>Having a private opportunity of
sending a package to America, I

all full of odds and ends as it is.
Caught up in my few spare moments,
it only contains fragments of what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
was in my heart. The young missionary
who is to take it is only
twenty-five years old, and has just
been ordained. He is full of enthusiasm
for the missionary life. He
belongs to a noble family in Auvergne,
and is a relative of our dear
Sr. St. A&mdash;&mdash;'s. He is the youngest
of a patriarchal family of eighteen, six
of whom are in heaven. Of the remaining
twelve, nine are consecrated
to God&mdash;two are Jesuits, two Visitandines,
one a lady of the Sacred Heart,
two devote themselves to the care of
the insane, and the ninth is in some
other order of charity. This young
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">père</i> has been thirteen years with the
Jesuits, six as a pupil, and since as a
member of the order. His first mass
was at Christmas, and was served by
one of the children of La Salette, to
whom the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared.
The next day his mission to
America was assigned him. He seems
full of zeal and piety.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>I must close my long journal. It
is a piece of my heart which I send
across the waters, while I remain
here. Good-night, my friend. I extend
my arms across the wide ocean
to embrace you. I never retire to
rest without throwing open my casement
to look at "the cloistered stars
that walk the holy aisles of heaven."
They alone are familiar to me in this
strange land. I have loved them
from my infancy, and I fancy they
look down tenderly and tearfully
upon me. The thought brings tears
to my eyes. Oh! shine as gently on
those I love. Let each bright beam
be a holy inspiration in their hearts&mdash;each
tearful ray carry consolation to
the soul troubled and in sorrow. A
passage from the German says, "I
know but two beautiful things in the
universe&mdash;the starry sky above our
heads and the sense of duty within
our hearts." I leave the one and return
to the other.</p>

<h2>APPEAL TO YOUNG CHRISTIAN WOMEN.</h2>

<p class="center">BY MARIE DE GENTELLES.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p class="center">BRIEF OF HIS HOLINESS PIUS IX.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Pius IX. Pope, to His Beloved Daughter in Christ, Marie de Gentelles</span>:</p>

<p>Beloved daughter in Christ,
grace and apostolic benediction.</p>

<p>In these days when the peril of
souls is continually growing greater,
we have always directed our efforts
particularly to the extirpation of the
roots of evil, among which not the
least pernicious is female extravagance.
Hence, last October, when
we spoke of the respect due to the
holiness of our churches and of certain
disorders which had begun to
appear among the people of Rome,
we took occasion to speak likewise
of this destructive pestilence which is
spreading in every direction, and of
its remedies.</p>

<p>We were much pleased, therefore,
to see, beloved daughter in Christ,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
that you have not only followed our
advice yourself; but, being deeply impressed
with its force and importance,
have written a book in which
you depict the sad consequences of
extravagance, and call upon the women
of the present day, and particularly
those who belong to the societies
of the Christian Mothers and the
Daughters of Mary, to unite against
this pernicious evil, which is so destructive
to morals and to the welfare
of the family.</p>

<p>Female extravagance wastes, in
superfluous adornment of the body,
and in frequent attention to the toilette,
time which should be given to
works of piety and mercy, and to the
care of the household; it calls its votaries
from home to brilliant assemblages,
to public places, and to theatres;
it causes them, under pretext
of complying with the requirements
of society, to pay numerous visits,
and thus to waste hours in news-seeking
and in scandalous conversation;
it attracts sinful desire; it wastes
the patrimony of children and deprives
poverty of needful assistance;
frequently it separates those who
are married; more frequently, it prevents
marriages, for there are but
few men who are willing to incur
such heavy expenses. As Tertullian
wrote, "In a little casket of jewels
women display an immense fortune;
they place on a single string of pearls
ten millions of sesterces; a slender
neck upbears forests and islands;
beautiful ears expend the income of
a month; and every finger of the left
hand plays with the contents of a
bag of gold. Such is the strength of
vanity; for it is vanity that enables
the delicate body of woman thus to
walk beneath the weight of enormous
wealth." Experience shows
that this aversion to marriage fosters
and increases immorality. In the family,
it is almost impossible in the
midst of so many distracting vanities
to cultivate domestic love by means
of domestic intercourse, or to give to
religion even what ordinary custom
requires.</p>

<p>The education of children is neglected,
household affairs do not receive
proper attention and fall into
disorder, and the words of the apostle
become applicable, "If any one
have not care of his own, and especially
of those of his household, he
hath denied the faith, and is worse
than an infidel."</p>

<p>As a city is composed of families,
and a province of cities, and a country
of provinces, the family thus vitiated
disorders the whole of society,
and step by step brings upon us
those calamities which to-day we behold
on every side.</p>

<p>We trust, therefore, that many will
unite with you to remove from
themselves, their families, and their
fatherland the cause of so many
evils. We trust, also, that their example
will induce others to lay aside
whatever goes beyond the just limits
of neatness. Oh! that women would
believe that the esteem and love of
their husbands is to be won, not by
magnificent dress or costly adornments,
but by cultivation of the mind
and of the heart and of every virtue.
For the glory of woman is from within,
and she that is holy and modest
is grace added unto grace, and she
alone shall receive praise who feareth
the Lord.</p>

<p>We trust and believe, therefore, that
your undertaking will meet with the
happiest success. As a presage of
which, and a pledge of our paternal
good will, with the tenderest affection,
we impart to you our apostolic benediction.</p>

<p>Given in Rome, at St. Peter's, on
the eighth day of July, 1868, in the
twenty-third year of our pontificate.</p>

<p>On occasions rendered doubly
solemn by their infrequency, the
common father of the faithful raises
his voice to warn the entire world
either against abuses which threaten
society, or against those perverse
doctrines which would attempt the
annihilation of the kingdom of truth.
These sacred words, coming from the
lips of him to whom Jesus Christ has
entrusted the care of his church, are
always received by the whole of the
immense Catholic family with that
respect and submission which are due
to a father.</p>

<p>A few months ago, Pius IX. suggested
the establishment of a society
of ladies who by their example and
influence might succeed in moderating
that extravagance which is the ruin
of families, and one of the principal
causes of immorality. "In order to
accomplish this most difficult undertaking,"
adds his Holiness, "we must
remind women that if in every place
it is unbecoming modesty to endeavor
to attract attention by extravagance
and strangeness of dress, in the sacred
church where God dwells and
sits upon a throne of mercy to receive
the prayers and adorations of the
faithful, it is a true insult to him in
whose eyes pride, pomp, and the
desire of pleasing men are hateful."</p>

<p>These words of the Holy See, we
may rest assured, are more applicable
to us women of France than to the
ladies of the Roman nobility, who
are more grave, more pious, and
more reserved, whatever may be said
to the contrary, than the women of
our land.</p>

<p>When travelling through England,
Germany, or Russia, have we not
sometimes felt a foolish pride on
seeing that everywhere the most elegant
robes and head-dresses were
styled "modes de Paris." It is true
that whatever in dress is new or
elegant is imported from the capital
of France, or is made after our Paris
fashions. But we have no reason to be
proud of this frivolous and dangerous
supremacy; for if it is universally said
that the French woman is truly elegant
in matters of dress, we should,
for that reason, feel under obligation
to undertake the reform of an abuse
which we aid if we do not originate.</p>

<p>Already, for several years, not only
has the Catholic pulpit spoken with
serious severity against the extravagance
of our sex, but even the
government has been aroused by
these abuses which are every day
producing the most evil results; and
we have not forgotten the severe
words of President Dupin to the
Senate in June, 1865. To-day, things
have assumed a still graver aspect,
for the Holy Father has called our
attention to this deplorable abuse.</p>

<p>The time, then, has come to undertake
a crusade, as it were, against an
enemy whom we shall not have to
cross the seas to seek, because he has
cunningly penetrated to our firesides,
there to sit beside us and to disturb
and destroy the peace of the family.</p>

<p>This necessary reform must be inaugurated
by the young women of
France; those of a mature age will
encourage and aid our efforts; but it
will be for us who cannot be accused
of envy or of jealousy to raise aloft
the standard of the holy league, to
put limits to extravagance, and to
say, "Thus far shalt thou go, and no
farther."</p>

<p>Extravagance in dress, and the
point it has at present attained, is
simply ridiculous folly, and at the
same time, what is more to be lamented,
it is in direct opposition to
the spirit of Christianity.</p>

<p>We are thinking creatures, rational
and intelligent. It is evident, and
there are those of our sex who have
proved that we are capable of feeling
the noble joy which is found in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
study of literature and the sciences,
and in the cultivation of the arts.
How comes it, then, that we are
content with those frivolous occupations
in which most of us squander
our time?</p>

<p>To rise as late as possible, to make
some calls, to drive to the Bois de
Boulogne, to visit some fashion emporiums,
to consult for whole hours
on the arrangement of a lace flounce
or the trimming of a gauze dress;
to return home, dress for dinner;
dress again for a soirée, a concert,
or a ball; to pass a number of
hours in exhibiting our own toilettes
and in finding fault with those of
others, and, finally, to retire to rest
when the sun is on the point of rising&mdash;frankly,
is not this the history
of day after day? When do we take
a book into our hands, unless perhaps
it be some new romance, of which the
style is as frivolous as the matter is
pernicious. But a book, a true book,
can one be seen on the table of our
boudoirs? Some journals of fashion
may be there; a review perhaps, cut
only where some romantic story is
found. What care we for the rest?
As to standard literary works, and
historical studies, how can we think
of them?</p>

<p>We never have a moment to ourselves,
and we often say with an
affected sigh, "Alas! the world is a
cruel tyrant; it takes up all my time,
my days, my nights." And we might
add, "My life and my intelligence;"
for are not many among us what
Tertullian would style "gilded nullities"?</p>

<p>While I was still a child, I happened
to meet with a charming young
woman, twenty-two years of age, who,
on recovering from an illness which
had nearly proved fatal, was seized
with a singular mania. She used to
play with dolls.... Isabel had remained
very gentle. Her friends at
first endeavored to drive away this unaccountable
mania; but as soon as
they took her dolls from her, she
seated herself in a corner of the
apartment, wept, refused all nourishment,
and would not speak.</p>

<p>In accordance with the advice of
physicians, her family had then yielded
to her childish tastes, and she
passed her whole time in dressing
and undressing her daughters, as she
called the dolls. Nothing could be
more pitiful than to see this tall,
beautiful girl, surrounded by her toys,
and amusing herself like a child of
six years.</p>

<p>Well! do we not resemble poor
Isabel somewhat, and, like her, would
we not be capable of weeping and
giving ourselves up to despair if our
playthings were taken from us?</p>

<p>Oh! yes, insanity, real insanity,
is that foolish extravagance which
consists in a constant changing of
the shape, material, and pattern of
our clothing. And is not insanity a
stranger to wisdom?</p>

<p>To be wise is to give to each object
in life that place which reasonably
belongs to it. It is to have for
all our actions a special and determined
end. If we see a man devoting
his whole time, his fortune, his
researches, to the formation of some
strange and perhaps eccentric collection&mdash;of
shoes, for instance, from every
country&mdash;we smile and say to one
another, "He is out of his senses!"
Out of his senses! and why? Is it because
he has but one thought, but
one ambition&mdash;to augment, to increase
his collection at any price?
We are more foolish than this collector
of old shoes, for many of us have
but one fixed thought, one only desire,
dare I acknowledge it, one sole aim
in life&mdash;to adorn ourselves! And no
collection will remain after us.</p>

<p>We might attempt to acquire an
honorable position in society by our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
virtues, or by the superiority of our
minds; but we merely desire to
attract attention by the extravagance
of our dress, to cause ourselves
to be remarked and admired, and if
possible, to humble our rivals. Do
not think I exaggerate, because such
is really the case, with an infinite
variety of shades; for in every woman
whose exclusive occupation is
the toilette, there inevitably exist a
desire to please and jealousy. You
enter a parlor in the evening wearing
a new robe, (and when you go
into company your toilettes are always
new, since you never appear
twice in the same dress;) well! you
are not satisfied until you observe
some admiring glances directed toward
you, until you perceive some
expressions of annoyance and envy
on the countenances of the young
women who surround you. Having
returned to your homes, what occupation
precedes your sleep? What
interrupts, what destroys it? You
think over in your mind all the ladies
you met at the ball; and if one
of them had a dress more beautiful
than yours, flowers more gracefully
arranged, or diamonds more sparkling,
you are discontented. You are
<em>jealous</em>. Then what plans you make
not to be eclipsed another time, but
to be the most beautiful. It is not
enough that we are admired; our
happiness is in reigning alone.</p>

<p>We often shelter ourselves behind
this singular excuse, "I do not wish
that my husband should be ashamed
of me. I endeavor to present a fine
appearance, but it is entirely for his
sake."</p>

<p>If we would occasionally condescend
to ask the advice of our <em>masters</em>,
if we would do so particularly
with our dry-goods or millinery bills
in our hands, I think they would be
more likely to advise simplicity in
our toilettes than to express themselves
satisfied with their extravagant
elegance. Now frankly, do you believe
these gentlemen so simple as to
desire that every glance may be directed
to the dress of their young
wife, or to the garland of flowers
which adorns her hair?</p>

<p>I was present one day, in the
house of a friend, at an amusing contradiction
given to assertions of this
sort.</p>

<p>Madame de G&mdash;&mdash;, assisted by her
maid, was trying on a rose-colored
satin dress which had just been sent
home from the dressmaker's, and
which she was to wear at a grand
official ball the same evening. She
turned round and round before the
mirror of the room, and her immense
trail appeared to her much too short.
What distressed her particularly was
that the corsage was not <em>low enough</em>.
I asked in astonishment how low she
wanted it.</p>

<p>"Mariette," said she to her maid,
"this must be cut several inches lower
all round."</p>

<p>And turning to me, "My husband
does not like such high-necked
dresses," she said.</p>

<p>While the lady was occupied with
some other detail of her charming
toilette, the door opened and the
husband to whom she so generously
sacrificed the requirements of modesty
entered. He examined his wife's
toilette. He had the right to do so,
since he would have to pay for it.
He thought the rose color a little too
lively, the trail a little too long, and,
above all, the corsage much, very
much too low.</p>

<p>"My dear child," said he, "your
dressmaker is incorrigible; she has
not the least judgment; you must
procure another. You cannot appear
in company so uncovered. Arrange
matters as best you can, but
this dress must be altered."</p>

<p>"Why! every one dresses this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
way. Is it my fault if you do not
understand these things, Adrian?
However, I shall not contradict you.
I will have a puff of tulle put around
the corsage. It is going to make
the dress horribly high, and all its
style will be lost."</p>

<p>Such is the opinion of a husband,
heard by chance; it is what is
sometimes said and what is always
thought.</p>

<p>Let us then appeal to the husbands!</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, to clothe one's self
is a necessity; to make her garments
becoming is, I might almost say, woman's
marriage portion; and I would
not dare to assert that our ancestors,
the Gauls, did not seek and discover
the means of wearing in a graceful
manner the skins of wild animals
which protected them from the inclemencies
of the seasons, just as the women
of the present day have learned
to clothe themselves with elegance in
the rich fabrics of India or in clouds
of exquisite lace.</p>

<p>But between the former and the
latter what a distance! What a broad
gulf!</p>

<p>There is something peculiar to the
toilettes of the present century; a
desire for unceasing change which
exceeds the bounds of eccentricity and
even of extravagance. The Greek
wife or Roman matron desired but
one thing&mdash;garments which would
enhance their beauty. Undoubtedly
they admired rich and costly goods;
but I do not believe that the day after
they had imported, at a great expense,
robes of the finest linen or
silken tunics of brilliant colors,
they would declare that fashion
would not permit a garment so cut
or a head dress arranged in such a
manner.</p>

<p>And without going back so far,
what would our ancestors of two
centuries ago say, if they saw the
decided repugnance we feel to appearing
twice in society with the
same toilette?</p>

<p>Their dresses, so rich, so graceful,
so sparingly adorned, were handed
down almost from generation to generation;
and surely those celebrated
women of the eighteenth century
were not less beautiful than we, as
their admirable portraits which adorn
our parlors clearly show. I lately
saw three pictures of the same marchioness,
taken at different periods of
life&mdash;as a very young woman, at thirty-five
or forty years of age, and at a
more advanced period of life; and I
found her in the three portraits wearing
the same robe of brocade, only
the rose-colored ribbon which adorned
her hair and her corsage in the first
two pictures had been replaced in
the third by a bow of a more sombre
color.</p>

<p>How astonished would those ladies
of the court of Louis XIV. have
been, if it had been predicted that
their great-grand-daughters would
change the style of their apparel or
the dimensions of their head-dresses
every year, and that a hundred different
publications would carry every
week from one end of France to the
other the inventions, more or less
happy, more or less singular, of some
fashion-maker of the capital. For
let us remark, and it is a sufficiently
striking fact, that in the continual
changes of fashion we who at times
find it so difficult to yield our wishes
to those of a husband whom we
have sworn before the altar to obey,
are always ready to yield obedience
to a milliner or a mantua-maker,
whose only desire is to sell their
goods. And in truth they succeed
in doing this very well. Have you
never remarked a very curious circumstance,
and one which deserves
to be related in the history of the
costumes of the nineteenth century?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
To-day, fashion passes from one extreme
to another, so that what was
worn last year is not permitted this
year. And now do you understand
this apparently strange custom? A
robe is graceful in style and trimming;
it is very becoming to you;
the color harmonizes well with your
complexion and your hair; your mirror
has told you so. The fashion
changes; your face, your style of
beauty, if beauty you possess, remain
the same; yet you do not hesitate
to discard your becoming attire
for something so ridiculous, so extravagant,
so frightful perhaps, as to
make you appear ungraceful or even
ugly; but you have obeyed the mandates
of fashion. Certainly the extravagances
and caprices of the present
day amply prove the truth of
what I have said.</p>

<p>Even if past forty, we will wear
short dresses, round hats, curls, and
high-heeled boots. Even if tall and
slender, no one will wear narrower
skirts. Even if possessed of a full
rounded form which we vainly deplore,
we will pick out white corsages, light
dresses, and the smallest of hats, because
our greatest, or rather our only,
fear is lest people should say that we
wear things which are out of fashion.</p>

<p>Fashion! Let us throw off its
shameful yoke. Instead of accepting,
let us make its laws. This is
reasonable ambition. Why not form
a committee, and every year, or at
the beginning of every season, pass
judgment on the important question
of the transformation of our toilettes?
Why not submit the laws made by
this female assembly to a committee
composed of our husbands; and finally,
promulgate and introduce them to
the notice of all whom they concern
by a special and duly authorized publication?</p>

<p>I commend this project to the serious
consideration of our young women.
All will admit that it would
be less humiliating for us to submit to
the dictates of fashion under such,
than under present circumstances.</p>

<p>Clothing has a twofold end: to
cover us and protect us from the inclemencies
of the seasons, to supply
the place of the beautiful fur or the
brilliant plumage which forms the natural
covering of beasts and birds.
I will return later to the question of
woman's clothing considered in a religious
and moral point of view. At
present, I shall treat of it only as it
regards health. Do our dresses cover
us? By a strange reversion of common
<em>sense</em>, it is during the severity of
winter we most willingly expose our
arms and necks. You smile? The
parlors are warm. But are our carriages,
are the streets of our large
cities? You would shudder if I
should present to you the frightful
statistics of the young women who
have fallen victims to such imprudences.
Every religion has its martyrs.
Do you wish to be martyrs to fashion?</p>

<p>The second end of our apparel is
to indicate the respective positions of
persons in society. Thus, the Roman
senators had the privilege of wearing
the white tunic ornamented with purple.
So also, in our own time, the
uniform of the army reveals at a
glance the rank of the wearer.
Alas! in this respect, of how much
use is it to us at the present day?
The sumptuary laws, the edicts of
Louis XIII. and Louis XIV., are entirely
forgotten.</p>

<p>There was a time when each class
of society had its special dress. Furs,
silk, gold, and silver could be worn
only by persons of a certain rank in
society. What a frightful revolution
would break forth among the women
of France if to-day the ruling sovereign
should attempt to regulate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
width of our laces or the number of
our jewels! In the present age extravagance
tends, on the contrary, to
confound all ranks of society. From
the servant girl to the fine lady there
is but one desire, one ambition&mdash;to
appear what one is not. Yes, to appear
what one is not; let us acknowledge
it to our shame. Is not the
fashion of our garments imitated, often
invented by women to whom we would
not speak? And around the lake of
the Bois de Boulogne have we not
sometimes mistaken the Marchioness
de &mdash;&mdash; for Mlle. X&mdash;&mdash;, or Mlle.
Z&mdash;&mdash; for the Countess de &mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>I feel rather ashamed to mention
such things; but addressing my own
sex, it is allowable; the truth is often
severe; but it is always useful. I
saw a lovely young woman in a saloon
one evening covered with confusion
at these few words addressed
to her by the Ambassador de &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>"I admired exceedingly, madame,
that elegant yellow dress you wore
this afternoon in the park."</p>

<p>"I!" she exclaimed in astonishment.
"My dear count, you are mistaken.
I was in blue, and the yellow dress
was worn by &mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"You are right. But pardon my
mistake; both ladies wore the same
kind of head-dress."</p>

<p>See to what our round hats, little
bonnets, and red locks lead.</p>

<p>What folly to keep ourselves continually
in a false position by our extravagant
outlays; to be reduced to
have recourse to a thousand petty
means of freeing ourselves from the
embarrassments in which our love
of dress has involved us.</p>

<p>To-day it is a lie.</p>

<p>"How much did this dress cost
you?" asks a husband, a little uneasy
at the prodigality of his young
wife.</p>

<p>"Two hundred francs," she replies
without hesitation, while she is fully
aware that double or triple that
amount would scarcely suffice to pay
for it.</p>

<p>And when the time arrives for paying
these formidable bills, how difficult
to procure the thousands of
francs represented by a few yards of
lace or faded silk. How we stoop
from the rightful dignity of our position
when we condescend to beg for
time and favor of a tradesman, or
dressmaker, or milliner, after confessing
that we have not the necessary
sum at our disposal.</p>

<p>In a certain city that I could name
a linen-draper had sold goods on credit
to a young woman to the amount
of forty thousand francs. Fearing
that she would never pay him, he
sacrificed the interest and accepted
this singular promissory note: "To
receive from my estate forty thousand
francs." The lady's heirs will find her
elegant dresses and fine laces rather
costly.</p>

<p>O folly, folly! Our lives pass
away amidst such trifles. We are
seeking happiness; it is here at our
hands. We could not only be happy
in the bosom of our families by fulfilling
our duties, but we could, moreover,
render those around us happy.
We foolishly prefer to cast aside these
true enjoyments and fill up our lives
with empty appearances of pleasure.</p>

<p>We forget how swiftly time flies.
To-day we are young, and the world
welcomes us; but our bloom, our
beauty, which to us is every thing,
will soon fade; it will vanish, and
what is more melancholy than old
age for many women? To know
how to grow old,... it is knowledge
which the wise alone possess.</p>

<p>The Holy Scripture, in addressing
the daughters of Sion, pictures with
striking truth the kind of punishment
which God reserves for them. The
Holy Spirit adopts, in some measure,
the language of the worldly woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
herself, and it seems to me that these
words might be addressed to each one
of us:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Because the daughters of Sion are
haughty, and have walked with stretched-out
necks, and wanton glances of their eyes,
and made a noise as they walked with their
feet, and moved in a set pace:</p>

<p>"The Lord will make bald the crown of
the head of the daughters of Sion, and the
Lord will discover their hair.</p>

<p>"In that day the Lord will take away
the ornaments of shoes, and little moons,</p>

<p>"And chains and necklaces, and bracelets,
and bonnets,</p>

<p>"And bodkins, and ornaments of the
legs, and tablets, and sweet-balls, and ear-rings,</p>

<p>"And rings, and jewels hanging on the
forehead.</p>

<p>"And changes of apparel, and short
cloaks, and fine linen, and crisping-pins.</p>

<p>"And looking-glasses, and lawns, and
head-bands, and fine veils.</p>

<p>"And instead of a sweet smell there
shall be stench, and instead of a girdle a
cord, and instead of curled hair baldness,
and instead of a stomacher hair-cloth."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In these words we are threatened
with old age; with that old age which
is daily drawing nearer; which awaits
but the moment to seize upon its
prey; which makes the woman who
leads a life of gayety that which you
well know.</p>

<p>Oh! those women who remain
beautiful in spite of old age, with
their white hair, their wrinkles undisguised,
their cultivated minds, and
their winning kindness. These are
not the women who in earlier life
placed all their happiness in following,
even to the most minute details,
the frivolities of fashion. I am, moreover,
convinced that if the woman of
the world of twenty or thirty years
ago was fond of dress, she was far
from devoting her whole time to it.
Fashion was not then so variable.
The outlay for clothing was evidently
a much smaller item in the family expenses.
In a word, if this folly was
sometimes seen, it was an isolated
case.</p>

<p>In these latter days only has the
contagion spread in an alarming
manner.</p>

<p>So much for the human side of the
question. Permit me now to enter
into a more elevated circle of ideas,
and to remark that hitherto I have
appealed neither to conscience nor to
religion. I have addressed myself
to women of the world; I now turn
to young Christian women; to those
whose tender years were watched
over by pious mothers, whose youth
was formed by a truly religious education;
to those whose lives have not
been blighted by any of those errors
which banish a woman from her position
in society, but who, on the
contrary, have remained unsullied in
the eyes of the world and have no
cause to blush beneath its gaze.
Here I feel at my ease, since it is
permitted me to make use of the language
of faith. This faith we still
possess, but it slumbers in the depths
of our souls; undoubtedly it will awaken
in the hour of trial; the death of
a darling child, a sudden change of
fortune; less than that even&mdash;a single
deception may suffice, and we shall
feel that God is our father; and we
shall see things in their true light;
that poisonous cloud which surrounds
the woman of the world will be instantly
dispelled, and the mysteries
of life and death will be unfolded to
our astonished gaze. But until that
time shall come, our life is consumed
in a strange and dangerous illusion.
A few religious practices of which we
have retained the habit, perhaps because
they were fashionable, make us
believe, and therefore cause others to
believe, that we are still real Christians.
Meanwhile, carried away by
the round of pleasure which we call
legitimate enjoyment, we live on,
without troubling ourselves to inquire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
whither we are hastening. Days follow
days, years succeed years; from
time to time one among us is missing.
God has called her away; but we did
not hear her last words; we did not
see the despair of that poor young
woman when she found herself in the
presence of her Judge with her hands
empty. And hence we continue in
our mode of life. Hours and days
of weariness, of sadness occasionally
steal in upon our worldly lives.
Some new pleasure claims us, and in
its presence past bitterness is soon
forgotten. Thus are spent the best
years of our lives, lost&mdash;religiously
speaking&mdash;lost for ever. Our actions
are useless, our thoughts frivolous,
our existence devoid of all merit.
And yet ought not our constant
aim be to secure the happiness of our
husband, and the salvation of his soul
as well as of our own? to bring up
our children in a Christian manner,
and to edify the world by our example?</p>

<p>This point presents a fit subject for
religious moralizing, which, however,
comes neither within my aim nor my
ability. It is for voices possessing
greater authority than mine to treat
of such grave matters in a becoming
manner. The ministers of the church,
both by preaching and the pen, have
shown us our duties with a clearness
and a correctness before which we
humbly bow. But as to a question
of detail, especially when, as at present,
it concerns extravagance of
dress, I believe I am right in thinking
that one of yourselves can, better
than any one else, treat a subject so
distinctively pertaining to woman.</p>

<p>Let me remark in the beginning
that I wish to condemn in our toilette
nothing save what is contrary to propriety
or modesty. I am not opposed
to crinoline, to trails, to diamonds,
nor to rubies. Rose color, blue,
white, and black are alike to me.
Whether linen, silk, or wool serve by
turn to cover us, is a matter of indifference.
Moreover, it is evident that
woman, whatever her age or condition,
should endeavor to render
her attire suitable and becoming. St.
Francis of Sales desires that a wife
should adorn herself to please her
husband; and a maiden, with a view
to a holy marriage.</p>

<p>The woman who betrays an absolute
negligence in her toilette, who
would willingly appear in a torn dress
or a faded bonnet, when her position
in society requires something better,
is almost as much to blame as those
who spend their whole time in dressing
and undressing.</p>

<p>That which we ought to possess,
that which should regulate our dress,
as well as all our actions, is a clear
comprehension of our duties. We
should appeal to our conscience,
scrutinize our intentions and our
desires, and then regulate and reform
wherever there is need.</p>

<p>We do not deny that this world is
a place of pilgrimage, and life a season
of trials; that they are foolish indeed
who think only of culling flowers
from the road-side while time flies
and eternity approaches. We often
experience within ourselves a certain
opposition between our convictions
and our conduct. Our life is not
regulated as it ought to be. It is
not tending to its end, which is our
eternal salvation. We have acknowledged
these truths when, on leaving
the church where we had listened to
some celebrated preacher, we confessed
to ourselves that our mode of
life was not sufficiently serious, and
that it ought to be reformed.</p>

<p>Strange to say, I feel, I see, many
women in like manner feel and see,
that the love of dress, the importance
we attach to every thing connected
with fashion, is the principal cause of
the frivolity and inutility of our lives.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
But there we stop. What! you will
say, has a ribbon, a flower, a piece
of velvet or satin so great an influence
with us? Try, then, to maintain
the contrary with your hand
upon your conscience, and you will
see that I have not gone too far.</p>

<p>Much is said about woman's mission!
It is constantly repeated that
the future of society depends on us.
If we occasionally forget this, we
should certainly not suffer others to
doubt it. We wish&mdash;and we are
right in doing so&mdash;we wish to occupy
an important position in the family
and in society; we struggle vigorously
against those who would assign
to us a secondary position; we boast
that we exercise a great influence
over men. This idea flatters our
self-love.</p>

<p>But let us not forget that this
circumstance becomes for us a source
of strict obligations. Man is nurtured
in our arms, and grows up at our
side. He is, we may say, whatever
we make him. That primary instruction
which it is our duty to
impart to him, exercises the greatest
influence on his after life. His mother!
He will always remember her,
and her example, good or evil, will
leave an indelible impression on his
soul. And our husbands, our fathers
and brothers! We know our power
over them, and we sometimes use it
in matters which are not really worth
all the diplomacy we employ. That
mission of mother, of wife! Have we
forgotten that it is the end of our
life, the reason of our creation?
God, who has established laws for
the material world, laws from which
even a slight derogation would produce
a great catastrophe, has likewise
marked out for each one of us
her place here below. He has not
placed us in this world without a
definite end in view. Woman has
serious duties to perform, of which
she must one day render a strict account
to her Creator.</p>

<p>Have these duties, these obligations
which our Lord has imposed upon us,
been hitherto our principal concern?
Has our worldly life, with its numerous
preoccupations, left us time to
be true wives and true mothers?
Alas! the world and its requirements
take up all our time. And
yet the duties to which we are bound
by this twofold title, although differing
with our different positions in the
world, oblige equally the wife of the
mechanic, the merchant, the officer,
and the prince, before both God and
society. Here, then, is the pith of
this question; it may be summed up
in a single word: are we wives and
mothers, or are we merely women of
the world?</p>

<p>Those children whom God has confided
to our care, and of whom we
shall have to render an account, do
we suppose that we have done our
duty toward them when we have
procured tutors for them, or when we
have placed them in an academy?</p>

<p>How many among us, alas! find it
difficult to see our children for even
a few minutes during the course of
the day. We have not the time to
attend to them, we say. We have
not the <em>time</em>! To whom does our
time belong, if not to these little
ones who call upon us by the
sweet name of mother? Let us not
plead our position. I know women
who mingle a great deal in society,
who have a great number of servants
to be looked after, who yet manage
their time so well that they are enabled
to spend the greater part of
the day with their children. They
have hours set apart for conversing
with them, for informing themselves
of their progress&mdash;in a word, for attending
to their education. These
mothers are happy. The gratitude
of their young families, the affection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
which surrounds them, the sense of
duty performed&mdash;shall we dare compare
these true and noble enjoyments
with the empty pleasures which the
exhibition of a new dress or even an
eulogium passed on our beauty procures
us? And, candidly, is it not
more worthy, more sensible, to say,
"I have not time to go to the park,"
than to allege that we have not time
to love and to care for our children?</p>

<p>And our husbands&mdash;do we devote
our time to them any more than to
our children?</p>

<p>Ah! you will perhaps reply, my
husband has very little need of my
society; he lives for himself; I live
for myself. If I have my toilettes,
my drives, and my friends, he has his
horses, his friends, and his club.</p>

<p>There is the misfortune; and the
question is, are we not, to a considerable
extent, responsible for this deplorable
habit of, so to speak, separate
existences? Do you not think,
then, that the majority of husbands
would prefer a different kind of life?
That it would be more agreeable to
them to enjoy oftener the pleasures
of home, in your company, surrounded
by their children?</p>

<p>You do not believe it? Be it so;
but have you ever tried the experiment?
Have you not yourselves
created a necessity for this life of
continual agitation and excitement?
Have you ever reserved time to be
devoted to your husband? And is
it not your desire that things should
remain just as they are&mdash;you with
your liberty and your husband with
his? Do you not prefer to squander
(for that is the word) your hours and
your days, rather than face the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</i>
that your own worldly tastes
would cause you to experience in the
retirement of a serious, and, in comparison,
solitary home?</p>

<p>But it is not our time alone that
we thus waste. We waste likewise
a fortune which in reality is not
ours.</p>

<p>We are born rich, while all around
us the poor&mdash;children of the same
God&mdash;are without bread to eat, and
ready to die of hunger, perhaps under
the same roof.</p>

<p>We forget that, according to the
designs of Providence, we have a
duty to discharge toward the suffering
and the needy! It is not for
ourselves alone that God has given
us riches. He wishes us to be his
almoners, and the practice of charity
is a strict duty.</p>

<p>The bestowing of alms is not only
an evangelical counsel; it is often a
precept. If the divine Ruler employs
the most tender images in describing
the merit of charity and the clearest
and strongest promises when speaking
of its reward, he has for the
one who refuses to assist a brother,
and leaves him in want, the severest
of condemnations. Consider the
parable of Lazarus and the rich sinner,
but especially those terrible
words: "I was hungry, and you
gave me not to eat.... Depart
into everlasting fire."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Will a few gold pieces ostentatiously
dropped each year into the collection
boxes, a few contributions to other
charities, which we are ashamed to
refuse, suffice to save us from a similar
sentence? What has become of
that pious custom of tithes for the
poor formerly found in rich families?</p>

<p>If, before entering the establishment
of the fashionable jeweller, we would
ascend to the garret of the indigent&mdash;we
should often purchase fewer bracelets.
It is not heart that is wanting
in us, but reflection.</p>

<p>A young woman of whom some
one was asking assistance for a family
which had fallen into misery, and
whose sufferings they were picturing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>to her, exclaimed with a simplicity
which was her only excuse:</p>

<p>"Why, are there people who are
poor? I did not know it!"</p>

<p>We know that there are poor people,
but we too often forget it. Love
of dress and the voice of vanity
smother in us the love of the suffering
members of Jesus Christ and render
us deaf to the appeal of our unhappy
brethren.</p>

<p>If we would only consider that by
sacrificing a few yards of lace, or by
consenting to appear twice during a
season in the same dress, we might
with the money thus saved assist several
families each winter, we would
more frequently be kind and charitable.</p>

<p>And that we may not forget the
necessities of our brethren, let us assist
them directly. Does not history
tell us of more than one queen fashioning
with her own hands garments
for the poor, and laying aside the
grandeur of her position to distribute
them herself?</p>

<p>Ball-rooms, theatres, and the public
drives are, unfortunately, not the only
places in which we make a display.
Fashionable dressing has become
such a habit, such a necessity with
us, that, as the Sovereign Pontiff remarked
with sorrow, our holy temples
often present the sad spectacle of
women who call themselves Christians,
and believe themselves such,
coming to these holy places rather to
rival one another in extravagance
of attire than to excite to piety.
Alas! what influence will our supplications
have, if humility, that essential
condition of prayer, be wanting. Ah!
let us rather remain at home than go
to the foot of the altar with the guilty
desire of being admired.</p>

<p>I have yet another part of this important
subject to treat: the impropriety,
the indecency, why not say
the word, of certain fashions?</p>

<p>I turn in shame from the thought
of them. Let each one of us descend
to the very depths of our conscience,
let us scrutinize our hearts,
bearing in mind this terrible utterance:
"He that shall scandalize one
of these little ones that believe in me,
it were better for him that a millstone
were hanged about his neck, and that
he were drowned in the depth of the
sea."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>How, then, are we to remedy so
great an evil? How oppose a barrier
to this ever-increasing tide of luxury
and of prodigality? The Holy Father
points out the way in a few plain and
simple words. To form among ourselves
an association&mdash;a holy league,
if I may thus express myself&mdash;to have
our laws and regulations, and, with the
zeal and determination which characterize
us when we wish to attain
any end, to pursue this one without
truce or mercy.</p>

<p>But what promises could and
should be made by the members of
this sacred league? They will have
to be determined by the brave champion
who shall bear the standard in
this war against extravagance. I do
not think, however, any difficulty will
be found in their determination. We
should begin by promising to examine
seriously before God what are
the motives which actuate us in
the adornment and embellishment of
our persons; to purify our intentions,
and to entertain none that would
cause a blush if revealed.</p>

<p>To please our husbands, to support
our position in society, to remain
within the bounds of a just elegance,
these are motives which we can without
shame avow. But to seek in the
toilette a means of being remarked,
or admired, or loved, outside of our
home circle; a means of humiliating
other women, of surpassing them, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
reigning without a rival; in a word,
of eclipsing all others&mdash;all this would
be entirely contrary to the spirit of
the association.</p>

<p>As to the engagements, in some
sort material, to be entered into by
the members, I think they might be
limited to three.</p>

<p>We should first determine in advance,
and in the most positive manner,
the amount to be expended each
year on our toilette; which amount
we should never exceed. From this
sum we should deduct a portion for
the poor, and increase the amount
as much as possible by accustoming
ourselves to sacrifice from time to
time our wish for some novelty, in
order that we may relieve our unfortunate
brethren, upon whom we
should bestow our charities in person.</p>

<p>Finally, and here is a very essential
point, we should never purchase
any thing without paying for it immediately;
or if, in some circumstances,
this is impossible, we should lay
aside the price of the dress, the bonnet,
or the cashmere we have selected.</p>

<p>Oh! if we could well understand
how much there is of order and of
good sense in those two words so little
known to most women&mdash;<em>cash payments</em>!
Try this plan, if only for a
year, or even six months, and you
will see the truth of my assertion.</p>

<p>I have finished; pardon me for
having dared to raise my voice, not
to give you advice, I have neither
the right nor the intention to do so, but
only to communicate to you ideas
which have been suggested to my
mind by the admonitions of the
highest of authorities, and by the resolutions
which I have taken, and
which I trust I shall have the courage
to keep.</p>

<p>My object is, to ask of you in this
matter that union in which is found
strength, and to remind you that
God is in the midst of those who
fight for a holy cause. May my
voice be heard! May the young
women of our beloved France arouse
themselves at the thought of a danger
which threatens the dignity of
our sex! May this new and holy
war be soon inaugurated in which we
shall be both combatants and conquerors!</p>

<h2>LOST AND FOUND. A WAYSIDE REMINISCENCE.</h2>


<p>What woman, travelling alone, has
not encountered the embarrassment
of entering a car already nearly filled
with passengers? Perhaps the awkwardness
of the situation may not be
as keenly felt by those who frequently
meet it, and who are accustomed to
the manifold jostlings of this busy
world, as by a recluse like myself.
However this may be, I can testify
from experience that the ordeal is a
painful one to a sensitive and shrinking
nature. So it chanced that, upon
discovering this condition of affairs
as I entered a car at Prescott, on a
fine morning in June, 1867, I dropped
into the first vacant place my eye
detected, by the side of an elderly
lady dressed in deep mourning. The
first glimpse of her face and manner
satisfied me that she also was from the
"States," and I felt quite at home
with her at once.</p>

<p>We soon fell into conversation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
I found my companion most agreeable,
quiet, and intelligent. We beguiled
the monotony of a railway
journey by pleasant chat upon the
scenery through which we were passing,
and such other topics as came
uppermost. I noticed, as we stopped
a few minutes at Brockville, that she
seemed to scan all that could be seen
from the car with deep interest; and
again, as we pursued our course up
the river in sight of the Thousand
Islands, she was quite absorbed in her
observation of the scenery.</p>

<p>"Beautiful islands," I remarked;
"I would like nothing better than to
occupy some days in exploring their
fairy haunts."</p>

<p>"You would find many of them
beautiful indeed!" she replied. "They
are very dear to me; for my early life
was passed in their neighborhood,
and I retain for them much of the
affection that clings to the memory
of dear friends, though I have not
seen them before for many years.
What frequent merry-makings and
picnic festivals did the young people
from the American shore and those
of Brockville enjoy together among
the windings of their picturesque
labyrinth, long ago!" she added with
a sigh.</p>

<p>She then informed me that she was
now on her way to Illinois, to visit
her children there, and had chosen
this route, that she might catch a
passing glimpse of scenes most interesting
to her, from their connection
with memories of the past.</p>

<p>Time and space passed almost imperceptibly
to us, as we were engaged
in discussing one subject after another
of general interest, until some time in
the afternoon, when, clatter! clatter!
thump! thump! a jolt and a bounce,
brought every man in the car to his
feet, and caused every woman instinctively
to settle herself more firmly
in her place, while a volley of exclamations,
"What can it be?"
"There's something wrong!" "Cars
off the track!" "We shall be down
the embankment!" burst from every
quarter, the swaying, irregular movement
preventing the possibility of
reaching the door, to discover the
cause of all this disturbance. The
time seemed long, but in reality
occupied only a few seconds, before
the motion ceased suddenly, with a
hitch, a backward jerk, and a concussion,
which had well-nigh thrown
us all upon our faces; and the conductor
appeared for a moment in the
door, uttering with hasty tremor,
"Don't be alarmed, ladies and gentlemen&mdash;no
danger! axle broke&mdash;cars
off the track. We shall be detained
here some time." And away he went.</p>

<p>This announcement was met, I am
sorry to say, with more murmurs at
the detention than thanks for our
providential escape from imminent peril.
"How unfortunate!" cried one.
"And in this lonely, disagreeable place
too!" added another. A third wondered
where we were, when one of
the company familiar with the route
volunteered the information that we
were not many miles from Toronto.</p>

<p>Now, from the moment I sat down
by my new acquaintance, I had
divined&mdash;by that sort of mysterious
sympathy, impossible to define, but
which will be understood by all converts
to the Catholic faith&mdash;that she
was, like myself, of this class; and
she had formed the same conjecture
in relation to me; which was,
perhaps, the cause of our having
formed a sudden intimacy not quite
in keeping with the native reserve,
not to say shyness, of both. Our
first and simultaneous act, upon the
occurrence of the incident recorded&mdash;in
fortifying ourselves with the blessed
sign of benediction and protection
so precious to all Catholics&mdash;had
confirmed the mutual conjecture, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
established a strong bond of sympathy
between us.</p>

<p>As we left the cars together, I observed
that she still scanned the surrounding
localities with an earnestness
that did not seem warranted by
any claims they possessed to notice;
for a more tame and uninteresting region
can scarcely be imagined than
that in which we so reluctantly lingered.</p>

<p>"What wonderful changes forty
years will make in the face of a new
country!" she at length exclaimed.
"I passed this way, going and returning,
in 1827, at an age when the
deepest impressions are received, and
upon an errand so peculiar in its nature
as to make those impressions indelible.
I have always carried the
picture of the route, slowly traversed
at that time, in my memory; but the
transformation is so complete that I
look in vain for one familiar feature."</p>

<p>After walking for some time in silence,
she resumed: "It is strange
how vividly the most minute details
of that journey and the incidents
connected with it return to me, now
that we are so singularly detained in
the vicinity of the scenes I then
sought, though there is nothing in
the aspect of the country to bring
them back!"</p>

<p>By this time we had loitered into a
shady nook, at no great distance from
the disabled car; and its coolness inviting
us to remain after we had seated
ourselves upon a rock overgrown
with moss, I begged that she would
while away the time of our detention
by giving me a history of those incidents.</p>

<p>"The narrative may not prove very
interesting to you," she replied.
"The recollection of events that
took place around us in youth has
more power to move ourselves than
others. But of this you shall judge
for yourself.</p>

<p>"In 1826, I was visiting a dear
friend who lived on St. Paul street, in
Montreal. It was a pleasant evening
in June, the close of one of those
very warm days so common in the
early part of a Canadian summer,
where the interval between the snows
and frost of winter and the fervid
heat, the verdure and bloom, of summer,
is often so marvellously short as
to astonish a stranger.</p>

<p>"I was sitting in my room, at an
open window that looked out on a
narrow back-court, the opposite side
of which was bounded by a row of
low-roofed tenant-houses parallel with
the bank of the river, and over these,
upon a magnificent view of the St.
Lawrence rolling grandly down past
the city, at which I was never tired
of gazing. I had been contemplating
the mighty flood for some time,
my thoughts wandering sorrowfully
far up its waters and the stream of
time to tranquil scenes now closed to
me for ever, when the words, 'Ah,
Donald! that I should live to see
this day! Do not ask me to sing
the hymn we love this night, when
my heart is sae sair that it is like
to break! I canna, canna sing the
sangs o' Zion i' this strange place,
and in our sharp, sharp griefs!'
came floating to my ear on the evening
breeze, from an open balcony
along the rear of the tenements mentioned.</p>

<p>"There was a depth of anguish in
the tones that touched the tenderest
chord of sympathy in my heart,
which was then writhing under the
pangs of a recent sore bereavement.</p>

<p>"My childhood had been passed
near settlements of the Lowland
Scotch in St. Lawrence County, New
York, and I was therefore familiar
with their dialect, the use of which
added to my interest in the speaker,
and I listened eagerly for further
sounds. For some time I heard only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
a suppressed sobbing, and the low
tones of a manly voice that seemed
to be soothing an outburst of grief
which was overwhelming his companion.
At length I heard him say,
with an accent that betokened a
tongue accustomed to the use of the
Gaelic dialect,</p>

<p>"'It would drown the sorrows
of my gentle Maggie, if she would
only strive to sing. Let us not forget
the dolors of our Blessed Mother
in the agonies of our ain grief. I
will sing, and mayhap she will join
me.'</p>

<p>"Presently a singularly wild and
plaintive air was borne to my ear
upon the flowing cadences of a man's
voice, as soft and musical as any
to which I had ever listened. The
words were in Gaelic, but the refrain
at the close of each verse '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ora,
Mater, ora</i>'&mdash;revealed their religion,
and that it was a hymn of the Blessed
Virgin to which I was listening.
Before the close of the first verse, he
was joined by a voice, low and clear
as the tones of a flute, bearing upon
every strain the fervent outpourings
of tender piety, though tremulous
with emotion.</p>

<p>"Soon after it ceased, they retired
within the open door of their room,
and I heard them reciting alternately,
in a low voice, that treasured devotion
of the Catholic heart&mdash;of which
I was then entirely ignorant, but
which has since (thank God!) become
inestimably precious to me&mdash;the
beads of the Holy Rosary.</p>

<p>"Their evening prayers being over,
they walked for some time on the
balcony in silence, when she said in a
trembling voice,</p>

<p>"'It is a month to-morrow, Donald,
a month to-morrow, sin' God took
awa' our darlings; and och! wha
wad hae thought I could bide sae
lang i' this cauld warld without a
sight o' their bonnie faces! I dinna
ken why I live, when my sweet
bairnies are buried far awa' i' their
watery grave!'</p>

<p>"'Ah Maggie! why wad ye not
live for your poor Donald? He
mourns for the bonnie bairnies too;
but he does not wish to leave his
Maggie because God has ta'en them
from her. Cast awa' these repining
thoughts, my own love, and let us go
to the church thegither to-morrow
morning, and lay all our griefs before
the altar of our God.'</p>

<p>"I heard no more; but resolving to
accompany them to church, I arose
very early the next morning, and preparing
myself, watched an opportunity
to join them, as they passed from the
street where they were stopping into
St. Paul street.</p>

<p>"We walked on in silence after I
joined them, and I saw that he was
a tall, athletic young Highlander, of
dark complexion, and with soft black
eyes; whose remarkably fine face
glowed with intelligence and mildness.
Her beauty was more conformed
to the Lowland type; her
eyes being of a deep clear blue, her
hair 'flaxen,' and her complexion
exceedingly fair, while her teeth of
snowy whiteness had a little prominence
that caused them to be slightly
revealed between her rose-bud lips,
even when her countenance was in
repose. Her form was very slender,
and her beautiful face so youthful as
to seem child-like. I never saw such
a perfect expression of soul-absorbing
yet patient and subdued sorrow
as lingered upon every line of those
youthful features.</p>

<p>"We entered the old Recollet church,
and I remained near them during the
service. It was my first visit to a
Catholic church, and I had never
before been present at the offering of
the holy sacrifice.</p>

<p>"Soon after our entry, I noticed
that first one of them and then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
other passed for a brief space of
time into a little curtained box at the
side of the aisle; but being ignorant
of Catholic usages, I did not know
for what purpose, though I was
deeply impressed by their solemn, reverent
manner, and the peaceful expression
of their faces. During the
progress of the service, which commenced
soon after, I saw them approach
the rail before the altar, and
knew it was to receive holy communion.
The sweetly serene and pensive
light that rested upon their features
after that solemn act is still
vividly before me, notwithstanding
the lapse of years.</p>

<p>"When they left the church, I followed
closely, determined to learn
something, if possible, of their history.
At the church door the man parted
from her, and went away in an opposite
direction from that by which we
had come, leaving her to walk back
alone. As I walked by her side, I
addressed some casual remark to her,
and then, confessing the interest I
felt in them on account of what I
had accidentally overheard the evening
before, begged her to tell me, as
her sister in affliction, of the griefs
which were oppressing her.</p>

<p>"We sauntered slowly down the narrow
streets from the Recollet church
to our places of abode, and our
young hearts being drawn together
by the bonds of sorrow, I mingled
my tears in sympathy with hers
while she related her artless
story.</p>

<p>"She was the only child of a minister
of the Scottish Kirk, whose name
was Lauder, and who died when she
was quite young. Her mother, being
left in feeble health, and destitute
of any means of support, gladly accepted
the home offered by her sister,
who was married some years before
to a Highland gentleman by the
name of Kenneth McGregor, and
who became a Catholic soon after her
marriage.</p>

<p>"They were welcomed to the home
of her aunt with true Scottish hospitality;
and the most devoted and
delicate attentions which affection
could devise were lavished upon her
heart-broken mother, to soothe and
comfort her, while the little Maggie
became at once the pet of a large
household of cousins older than herself,
who regarded her ever after as a
dear sister. So kind were the whole
family to her, that she was not permitted
to feel the loss of her father in
the sense most chilling and painful to
the heart of the orphan, that of being
an object of indifference and neglect.
They went frequently to visit their
Lowland friends, and kept up an intercourse
with them during the life of
her mother.</p>

<p>"When she had reached her twelfth
year, the minister of the kirk which
they had attended since their removal
to the Highlands, with several of his
small congregation, among whom
were her mother and herself, made
their profession of the Catholic faith;
soon after which event her mother
died.</p>

<p>"When Maggie was in her fourteenth
year, she became acquainted
with Donald Macpherson, whose father
was a warm friend of her uncle
Kenneth. A strong attachment soon
grew up between the young people, and
when she was sixteen she was married
to Donald. When they had been married
about six years, and had three
children&mdash;the oldest of them a daughter
five years old and named for herself,
and the others boys&mdash;Donald
thought best to join a colony (among
whom were two of her cousins and
their families) who were preparing to
depart for one of the new and remote
districts of Upper Canada. Donald,
as the one best fitted by education
for that purpose, was appointed surveyor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
of the wild lands, and to lay out
roads in the wilderness.</p>

<p>"They suffered much in parting with
home and friends, but alas! subsequent
floods of affliction obliterated
all traces of those lighter griefs.</p>

<p>"Their voyage was long and stormy,
and when they were at length in
sight of Newfoundland, and hoped
they were about to reach the end of
it in safety, a storm in the Gulf of
St. Lawrence drove their vessel upon
the rocks in the darkness of evening,
and it was wrecked. The poor young
parents lashed their little Maggie
firmly to a plank, and committed her
to the waves; then taking each a
child, and imploring the aid of
heaven for themselves and their little
ones, they plunged into the water.
The mother was soon exhausted with
the buffeting of the waves; her child
was borne from her arms, just before
she was thrown within the reach of
friendly hands, and taken up unconscious.
Donald was dashed against
the rocks, and caught from the receding
waters of an immense wave,
shortly after, by those who were
on the shore watching to render aid
to the sufferers, insensible and apparently
lifeless. The child he had was
also lost.</p>

<p>"They were taken to a fisherman's
hut, and by the persevering efforts
of those in attendance animation was
restored, though it was some days before
they recovered their consciousness,
only to find that their children
and their relations had perished. But
a small number of their companions
on the voyage survived. Their goods
and clothing, with the exception of
what they wore, were all lost; but
this was too trifling to be thought of
in comparison with their other misfortunes.</p>

<p>"As soon as they were able, they
proceeded to Montreal, in company
with the survivors of the wreck, and
Donald showed the certificate of his
appointment as surveyor&mdash;which he
fortunately carried in his vest-pocket&mdash;to
the mayor of the city, who provided
comfortable quarters for them,
and advised him to remain there until
he should receive remittances from
Scotland, for which they sent immediately
after their arrival in Montreal.</p>

<p>"They had not yet decided whether
they would return when these funds
should arrive, or go on to the place
for which they had started, as their
companions were anxious to have
them do.</p>

<p>"She expressed entire indifference as
to going on or returning; her children
being gone, she did not care
where she was. The terrified, imploring
look of her darling Maggie, as
she was dashed from them on her
frail support, amid the merciless buffetings
and boiling surges of the furious
waves&mdash;her eyes straining to
catch a glimpse of them, and her
dear little arms extended so pitifully
to them for protection&mdash;haunted the
imagination of the broken-hearted
mother, and, she assured me, had not
been absent from her thoughts one
moment since, sleeping or waking.</p>

<p>"My sincere and fervent sympathy
seemed to afford her some comfort,
and it was freely and heartily offered;
for I was myself, as I have hinted, at
that time a mourner over the recent
loss of the kindest and best of fathers,
whose only daughter and cherished
pet I had ever been. His death,
when I was yet but a child in years,
was followed by severe pecuniary
reverses, which had driven us from
our home and involved our hitherto
affluent and most happy family in
difficulties and poverty. In my ignorance
of sorrow and of the religion
which alone can sustain the afflicted,
I had thought there could be none
so unhappy and unfortunate as ourselves.
I could not then believe the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
truth of the assurance, which was the
solace of my invalid mother, that
'The Lord loveth whom he chasteneth.'
I could not see the tender
mercy and love that had inflicted this
cruel bereavement and surrounded
our helpless family with such calamities,
in the clear light with which his
grace afterward made it manifest to
me.</p>

<p>"But here was an instance far more
inscrutable and heart-rending. Strangers
in a strange land; the broad Atlantic
rolling between them and every
heart upon which they had any special
claim for sympathy; their children
relentlessly torn from them; and all
their worldly substance buried in the
consuming deep! Why had they
thus been singled out as marks for
such a shower of fatal arrows? I
pondered much upon it, and my eyes
were opened to see the mercies that
had been mingled with the chastisements
of a loving Father in our own
case. We had numerous and kind
friends, whose sympathy had poured
balm upon our wounded spirits, and
whose generous hands had been
opened to aid us in our necessities.
Of these, the dear friends with whom
I was then staying had been among
the first, and their assistance and advice
at that dark period of my life
have ever been remembered with
gratitude.</p>

<p>"While my new acquaintances remained
in Montreal, I passed much
time with poor Maggie, to the entire
satisfaction of my friends, to whom I
communicated the sorrowful story on
the day I heard it, and whose active
sympathy contributed much toward
the relief and comfort of the youthful
mourners.</p>

<p>"When they at length received the
expected funds from Scotland, they
decided to comply with the wishes
of their surviving fellow-sufferers in
exile and affliction, by accompanying
them, according to their original intention,
to Upper Canada. Our parting
was very affecting. They had
learned to look upon my friends as
kind benefactors, while they regarded
me as a sister. I felt very lonely
after they were gone; but the lesson
I had learned from my intercourse
with them was never forgotten. Their
united and unquestioning acquiescence
with the will of God, and the
persistent patience with which every
action of their daily lives expressed,
'Though he slay me, yet will I
trust in him,' made a permanent impression
on my mind.</p>

<p>"At the invitation and by the advice
of my friends, I remained much
longer in Montreal than I at first intended,
in order to learn the French
language, and to acquire the knowledge
of some other branches, for
which superior facilities were presented
by the Sisters of the Congregation
of Notre Dame, and which were
necessary to advance my education
sufficiently to fit me for teaching, the
object I then had in view.</p>

<p>"Nearly a year had passed since
our parting with the Macphersons,
when some friends from Vermont arrived
on a visit to those with whom I
was staying. I was requested, in consequence
of the indisposition of the
lady of the house, to accompany
them to several places of interest in
the city, which they wished to see.
Among these was the house of the
'Gray Nuns,' a sisterhood devoted
to the care of a great number of
foundlings. In passing through the
rooms appropriated to the children, I
was particularly attracted by the face
and attitude of a delicate-looking little
girl of surprising beauty, who was
sitting on the floor and devoting herself
to the care and amusement of a
little boy about two years old, whose
beauty equalled her own, though entirely
different in character. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
fair as a lily; her large blue eyes
were shaded by drooping lids and long
silken lashes, which imparted a touching
pensiveness to their expression,
while her golden hair floated in shining
curls to her shoulders. The little
boy's complexion was dark and clear,
his black eyes soft and brilliant. The
startled timidity combined with
searching earnestness in their expression
as he raised them to mine
and encountered my admiring gaze,
(for I was always passionately fond
of children,) thrilled my very soul,
and, turning to the good sister who
was conducting us, I exclaimed with
enthusiasm, pointing to them,</p>

<p>"'What beautiful children!'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' she said with fond pride,
and evidently flattered by our notice
of her pets, 'they are indeed beautiful;
and alas! their misfortunes are
as striking as their beauty. They
belonged to a Scotch family on board
a vessel that was wrecked off Newfoundland,
and their parents perished.
Mr. Ferguson, a Scotch gentleman
in very infirm health, from our
city, was visiting some friends in that
vicinity, and happened to be passing
in a carriage with one of them on the
evening of the storm and the shipwreck,
when, noticing the torches
and bustle on the shore, they stopped
to inquire the cause and to render
assistance, if possible, to those
who were washed ashore. This little
girl had been lashed to a plank, and,
by a wonderful providence, when the
baby was borne away from his mother,
the same wave carried him
within reach of his little sister, who
seized and clung to him as with a
dying grasp, until she was snatched
insensible by Mr. Ferguson from the
top of a wave which rolled far up on
the shore, and would have hurried
them back in its receding surf but
for a powerful effort on his part,
which had nearly cost him his life;
for he received injuries in the attempt,
by severe sprains and otherwise,
that rendered him almost helpless
for some weeks. His friend
took the children and himself in the
carriage to his residence, over two
miles distant&mdash;it being the nearest
house on that unfrequented part of
the coast, with the exception of some
fishermen's huts at some distance in
the opposite direction. Mr. Ferguson
was unable to leave his bed for
some weeks. Unfortunately, the physician
of that neighborhood was absent
on a visit to a distant city.</p>

<p>"'It was long before they succeeded
in restoring any sign of life to either of
the children, and when their efforts
were at length rewarded by faint evidences
of returning animation, they
had to exert themselves to the utmost
for many days to keep alive the vital
spark, which had been so nearly extinguished.
When they began to
revive and recover strength, another
difficulty met the devoted friends of
the little unfortunates. The nerves
of the little girl had sustained so severe
a shock that she could not be
aroused to a sense of any thing around
her. She was constantly struggling
fearfully with imaginary billows, or
settled in a kind of idiotic vacancy.
When the physician returned, he
gave but little hopes of her recovery,
as he feared her brain was so far affected
as to unsettle reason permanently.</p>

<p>"'As soon as the gentleman who
had taken them to his house dared
to leave them and Mr. Ferguson so
long, he went to inquire after the
survivors of the wreck, and found
they had departed in a vessel bound
for Montreal. Mr. Ferguson was
confined, as I have said, for many
weeks at the house of this friend, and
before he could return to Montreal
he had become so much attached to
the little treasures he had snatched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
from a watery grave, that he could
not be persuaded to leave them, (although
he was a bachelor,) but
brought them to us, that they might
be where he could sometimes see
them.</p>

<p>"'The little girl recovered but slowly.
After some time she began to have
lucid intervals, from which she would
sink into mental apathy. Her sleep
was for a long time broken by dreams
of agonizing struggles, from which
she would awake screaming, and so
terrified that it required our most
anxious and tender efforts to soothe
and quiet her. She has, however,
recovered almost entirely from these,
and her mind is quite clear, though
physically she is still a very delicate
child, and we fear her constitution
has encountered a shock from which
it will never recover. During the
first of her lucid intervals, she told us
her name, and what she could of her
parents.'</p>

<p>"While the good sister was reciting
this little history, I stood like one
in a maze, half unconscious of the
bewildering conviction which was
stealing over me that these were two
of the children whose loss my poor
friends, the Macphersons, were bemoaning;
and when at length she
closed the narrative, by saying that
the child had revealed her name, I
seized her arm with such a sudden
and convulsive grasp as called attention
for the first time to the fact that
I had become pale as death, and
whispered huskily,</p>

<p>"'What did she say was her
name?'</p>

<p>"'Maggie Lauder Macpherson,'
replied the sister, as I tottered to the
nearest seat, almost fainting under
the intense excitement. She hastened
to bring me some cold water and
other restoratives; after taking which
I explained to her, and to my astonished
companions, the cause of my
agitation in few words, and that the
parents still lived. When I sank
into the chair, little Maggie had
risen, and, approaching timidly, stood
watching me with great anxiety. As
soon as the momentary faintness
passed, I drew her closely to my
heart, and&mdash;still trembling with agitation&mdash;whispered
fondly and gently,</p>

<p>"'My dear little lassie, I knew and
loved your mother!' Looking up
most wistfully in my face, she asked,</p>

<p>"'Where?'</p>

<p>"'Here in Montreal,' I replied.</p>

<p>"'That canna be!' she murmured
with plaintive softness, and as if half-musing,
while the very expression of
her mother's own serene resignation,
mingled with a shade of disappointment,
passed over her lovely features.</p>

<p>"'That canna be, gentle leddy, for
my mither (and she shuddered as
she uttered it) was buried in the cauld
waves!'</p>

<p>"'No! my child,' I said softly;
'your father and mother both escaped,
and are living, though a great
ways from here.'</p>

<p>"It would be useless for me to attempt
a description of what followed,
as the truth of my assurance took
possession of her mind; but the excitement
of the sudden and joyful
surprise&mdash;which we feared might injure
her&mdash;seemed to restore the elasticity
of her youthful spirit; a result
that all other appliances had failed
to secure. It was then discovered
that the depressing consciousness of
their orphan and destitute condition
had so weighed upon her sensitive
young heart, as to affect her delicate
frame and prevent her restoration to
health.</p>

<p>"I immediately sought my friends,
and told them of the discovery;
after which we went together to see
Mr. Ferguson. It was agreed between
them, at once, that I should
accompany the children to Upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Canada and deliver them to their
parents, as a privilege to which I
was especially entitled on account of
the interest I had taken in the family.
They furnished all necessary
means for defraying the expenses of
the journey.</p>

<p>"I set out with my little treasures
the next morning, under charge of
an old gentleman who was going
to that vicinity on business. Our
course lay up the St. Lawrence, and
through a considerable portion of
Lake Ontario. When we landed
and left its shores, our journey continued
through a rugged wilderness
country of great extent, to regions,
then wilder still, in the interior of
Upper Canada, where settlements of
Scotch had been located. We stopped
at a rude log cabin that aspired
to the dignity of an inn, at the settlement
where the route of our stage-wagon
terminated, and which was
only a few miles distant from the
place we were in search of.</p>

<p>"While the gentleman who had the
care of us was out looking for a carriage
to take us on, I thought I
heard a familiar voice outside, and,
stepping to the window, looked from
it just in time to see Donald Macpherson
himself, in the very act of
driving away from the door, at which
he had stopped a moment to speak
to a man there. I tapped loudly on
the window, he turned his head, and,
throwing the reins to the hostler, in
another moment rushed into the
room, just as I had succeeded in hiding
the children in an adjoining bedroom,
and closing the door.</p>

<p>"'Is it possible, then,' said he,
'that it is indeed yoursel' I saw!
What in the name of gudeness could
hae brought you (the last one I
should have thought of seeing) to
this awfu' wild region! But I am
that glad, any how, to see your dear
face that I could cry, as Maggie will,
I'm sure; but they will be right joyful
tears she'll shed, for you will go
with me this very hour to our home
in the woods. But what could have
brought you to face the fatigue of
this rough journey?'</p>

<p>"'I came,' I replied as calmly as
I could, 'on business that nearly
concerns you and Maggie, and I am
so glad to meet you here! I am
sure Providence must have sent you;
for I have been trying all the way to
think how I could manage the business
on which I came, without being
able to settle upon any plan.
Breathe a prayer to Heaven, Donald
Macpherson, as fervently for strength
to bear your joy, as I have heard
you utter under the pressure of crushing
griefs, while I tell you,' I said
slowly, and fixing my eyes upon his
face, 'that Almighty God has sent
two of your lost children back to you
by my hands&mdash;your little Maggie
and your baby boy!'</p>

<p>"Never can I forget the expression
that stole over his features&mdash;now
white as the sculptured marble&mdash;when
I succeeded in finishing what
I had to say! He lifted his hands
and eyes reverently to heaven, and
murmured a prayer in his native
dialect. Then looking at me as if
awe-struck, he exclaimed,</p>

<p>"'Can it be that heaven has again
employed you, the former messenger
of its mercies to us, to bring this
crowning one to our stricken hearts
and desolated hearth? It is not possible!
It must be some wild dream!'
and he passed his hand over his
head as if bewildered. As he said it,
I drew him gently to the door of the
bedroom, opened it, and rushed out
of the room. I could not stay to
witness that meeting, and I knew
that the father would wish to be
alone with his recovered treasures.</p>

<p>"After some time I went back to
the happy group, but it was long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
before we could speak. Such joy
seemed too sacred for the interruption
of words.</p>

<p>"When we had sufficiently recovered
from the blissful agitation of the
scene, we set about concerting measures
for breaking the joyful news to
Maggie.</p>

<p>"He decided that he would go
home and bring her with him in a
double wagon&mdash;the one he had being
single&mdash;to accompany me to
their home; pleading my fatigue after
my journey as the reason why I
did not go with him at once. On
the way he was to prepare her for
the glad meeting, as well as he could.</p>

<p>"I will not dwell upon the raptures
of the young mother when she received
her children who had 'been
dead, but were alive again&mdash;had
been <em>lost</em>, but were <em>found</em>!'&mdash;only to
remark that she who had borne grief
so calmly and patiently met the elevation
also of this sudden transport
in the same edifying spirit, and with
many soft and tender ejaculations of
the gratitude with which her heart
was overflowing.</p>

<p>"The possibility of their children's
escape had never for one moment
occurred to the minds of the parents,
and in the confusion and darkness of
the shipwreck scene on the coast
their recovery was unnoticed. Their
condition, and that of Mr. Ferguson,
their being consequently hurried
away so suddenly from the vicinity,
and remaining so long unconscious,
together with the absence of
the physician, had prevented any
communications of a kind which
might have led to the disclosure of
their escape.</p>

<p>"The glad tidings soon spread
through all the settlements, and the
house was thronged early and late,
with people of high and low degree.
Rich and poor, Canadians, emigrants,
and 'Americans,' came from all parts
of the country to offer their congratulations&mdash;where
their sympathies
had before been freely bestowed&mdash;over
the <i>Lost and Found</i>.</p>

<p>"I formed many agreeable acquaintances
during the few weeks to which
I was persuaded to prolong my visit
in that part of the country.</p>

<p>"The vicissitudes of a changeful life&mdash;the
lapse of forty years, during
which I have stood by many graves
of my nearest and dearest&mdash;have not
been able to obliterate my fond recollections
of the Macphersons, and
have served only to engrave more
and more deeply in my heart the
lessons I learned from them, and my
conviction that those upon whom
God designs to bestow his richest
spiritual gifts must go up, as did
Moses of old, to 'meet him in the
cloud!'"</p>

<p>We sat for some time in silence
after she closed, and I then asked,</p>

<p>"Did you ever see or hear from
them after your departure?"</p>

<p>"Cars ready! Hurry up, ladies
and gentlemen! Hurry up!"</p>

<p>And groups of loungers, starting
from every direction, hastened gladly
to take their places and resume their
broken journey.</p>

<p>When we were again seated in the
car, I repeated my question, "Did
you ever see or hear from them
again?"</p>

<p>"I never saw them again," she replied,
"but we kept up a correspondence
for a long time. The example
of their lovely and pious lives exerted
a wide-spread influence in Canada.
Some years after the events I
have related, a large estate in Scotland
was left to them, from a distant
relative, and they returned to that
country. Their departure was deeply
deplored by all their neighbors in
the land of their adoption, and I
have heard that since their increased
means they have been active in advancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
every good work, both in
their Canadian home and in that to
which they have returned."</p>

<p>I parted with sincere regret from
my new friend at Toronto, which
was the limit of my excursion.</p>

<p>Her wayside story had so impressed
my memory that I indulged my
pen in transcribing it. If it yields
half the interest to others, at second
hand, with which I received it from
the actual participant, my labor will
be amply rewarded.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE CHURCH IN PARIS AND FRANCE.</h2>


<p>Though France is a Catholic country,
the humiliating fact that a considerable
portion of its male population
manifests a certain religious apathy,
cannot well be disguised. This
estrangement from the church is due
to various causes, but mainly to the
training received by the youth educated
at those public institutions which
monopolize the government patronage.
The University of Paris largely
influences all the public schools,
and its authority extended at one
time even over the establishments for
bringing up infants. The female
schools have, for various reasons, formed,
to a limited extent, an exception,
chiefly for the want of lay instructresses,
which rendered it absolutely
necessary to grant to the numerous
orders of nuns more extensive privileges.
The university, originally half
Christian and half deistic, has lately
sunk into the lowest materialism.
Even among the teachers of the elementary
schools there are many who
have discarded, more or less openly,
the Christian faith, and thereby set
the pupils a most pernicious example.
The secret and avowed foes of religion
preponderate in the educational
domain, and it is only with the utmost
difficulty that Christians, or
even deists, can be found for the
different scientific faculties. In other
respects, a marked improvement has,
however, taken place since 1850,
when the church was first allowed to
exercise a more direct influence over
the public schools, and some of the
most obnoxious opponents of Christianity
were removed from their educational
trusts. Still more beneficial has
been the concession of greater school
facilities. The public institutions superintended
by religious have doubled
in numbers and extent, being at
present attended by over 1,200,000
girls and 250,000 boys. In 1854,
there were in France 825 private institutions,
with 42,462 pupils, presided
over by laymen; and 256 institutions,
with 21,195 pupils, under the charge
of religious. In 1865, the number
of lay institutions amounted to only
657, with 43,007 pupils, while the
religious had increased to 278, with
34,897 pupils. While the former
gained, therefore, within eleven years
only 545 pupils, the latter gained 13,702.
Nor is this all. The schools
conducted by laymen have advanced
equally in a religious and a scientific
point of view, and are now no longer
so inferior as formerly to those
conducted by religious. The decided
progress which the church has
made in France during the last ten
or twelve years is principally owing
to the growth of religious instruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Unfortunately, the university still remains
unchanged, and many a pious
youth is lost when he enters one of
the faculties. It is otherwise with reference
to the lyceums and colleges,
where the religious have secured
a greater influence over the pupils,
though rationalists and sceptics still
continue to fill some of the chairs.
Three years ago, 29,852 pupils attended
the lyceums, and 32,495 the
colleges&mdash;a total of 62,347, which
shows a gain of 19,228 pupils since
1854. This increase is accounted for
by the support which these institutions
receive from the state. In 1854, the
number of lyceums was 53; in 1865,
it was 86.</p>

<p>In about the same period of time,
the Brothers of the Christian Schools
(<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Frères de la Doctrine Chretiènne</i>) had
founded 864 educational establishments
in France, 16 in the States of
the Church, 13 in Italy, 42 in Belgium,
2 in Switzerland, 2 in Austria, 3 in Prussia,
2 in England, 2 in Egypt, 4 in
Turkey, 19 in Canada, 29 in the United
States, 8 in India, and 2 in Ecuador&mdash;making
a total of 1043 establishments
with 8822 brothers. This number
has multiplied since. In France
alone, there are now over 900 establishments
and 6000 brothers. In
more recent days, many similar orders
have been organized, like that founded
by Lammenais, the brother of the apostate
priest, which is exclusively intended
for the agricultural education of boys,
and counts already thirty-odd schools
in Brittany. France has 18,000 male
ecclesiastics, and of these the greater
half are engaged in training the rising
generation. Of the 90,000 female
members belonging to the various
religious orders, one third are employed
in the same way. Out of the
whole number of religious, no less
than 72,000 are computed to devote
themselves to education, to the care
of the orphans, the sick, and the aged.
The pupils, the orphans, the invalids,
the incurables, the helpless, the poor
under the charge of the different religious
societies and orders number
over two millions. These are startling
figures for a land where the church
had been blotted out of existence
eighty years ago, and where religion
has ever since had to contend against
special legislation, unfriendly government,
and a whole host of powerful
foes, never very scrupulous in the
choice of their weapons.</p>

<p>Another cause of the religious apathy
is to be found in the desecration
of Sunday, which has become
very general in France, especially in
the larger cities. The revolution
suppressed Sunday by brute force,
and the law has ever since afforded
the greatest possible latitude to all
who were inclined to disregard its
obligations. Sunday labor came thus
to be gradually sanctioned by custom
and countenanced by law. Under
Louis Philippe, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i> managed
to turn this laxity to account, and
even to this day the work on the
public improvements proceeds without
reference to the festivals of Holy
Church or Sundays. At first the laborer,
tempted by the offer of higher
wages, consented to work on Sundays
for the sake of gain. Now stern
necessity compels the majority of laborers
to do this, and yet they barely
manage to support life. Once men
desecrated the Sunday out of avarice;
now they desecrate it to satisfy their
hunger. Such is the condition to
which irreligion has reduced the
French working-man. The capitalist
who introduced this desecration can,
however, afford better than ever to
rest each day of the week.</p>

<p>The amount of evil which the desecration
of Sunday has sown can
hardly be conceived. Hundreds
and thousands of those honest laborers
who flock to Paris and to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
great manufacturing centres from the
provinces have been morally and
physically destroyed by it. Not only
has the discharge of all religious obligations
become impracticable, but
there being no longer a day on which
the family finds itself united, every
thing like the love of home has been
destroyed. The tenderest and most
holy ties have been broken, the unity
of family interests has ceased, and
each member of the household has
been left to pursue his own course.
But as the human body requires some
rest, the mind some relaxation, so
men by way of compensation drink
and dissipate, which speedily destroys
their love for the fireside. On Sunday
afternoons and evenings, the
working-men exchange the shop only
for the tavern, and they soon learn to
find their relaxation and amusement
there even on week-days. The consequence
is, that the working-men have
become demoralized; they think of
nothing but work, or rather of the
means by which they may procure
that which will enable them to minister
to their depraved appetites.</p>

<p>In this manner the wants of these
men multiply in an inordinate degree,
their minds and tastes are debased,
and all their earnings soon cease to
suffice for even the most indispensable
articles of food and raiment.
Those who break the Lord's day,
though they seem to earn better wages,
look wretched, and have rarely
a decent coat to their backs. If the
weather, or some other unforeseen
cause, prevents them from working,
they resort to the tavern and spend
there their Sunday gains. It is notorious
that exactly in those work-shops
where the Sunday is habitually ignored,
the hands are the most dissipated
and shiftless. Even from a
purely material stand-point the non-observance
of Sunday is therefore a
fearful social evil which has unhappily
made serious progress, even in the
rural districts, and especially in those
immediately surrounding Paris.</p>

<p>This pagan system of civil legislation
interferes very materially with
the religious life. The French code
robs the father of nearly all authority
over his grown children; for instance,
a son eighteen years of age may legally
mortgage half the property
which he is to inherit, even though
it may have been earned by the parent's
personal industry. Husband
and wife hold their property separately,
neither being liable for the
debts of the other. In this way the
members of the same family are invested
with such widely diverging
rights that they can have no interests
in common. The effect of this
arrangement upon the domestic relations,
upon the harmony, unity, and
morals of the family will be readily
conceived. It is therefore to be regarded
at once as a wonder and a
proof of the power of the Catholic
Church that there should still exist
so many exemplary households in
France.</p>

<p>Wretchedness in all its forms naturally
goes hand in hand with these
false principles of legislation. Thanks
to the boasted progress of modern
days, there is more suffering and
misery in Paris than in any other
city on the continent of Europe.
Those who speak from personal observation
of the social condition in
Berlin, Vienna, and Paris, acknowledge
that pauperism is most gigantic
in the latter capital. In the year
1866, Paris contained 1,791,980 inhabitants,
of whom 105,119 were
paupers, or 40,644 families who received
aid from the municipal authorities.
This gives one pauper to
every seventeen inhabitants; but the
number of destitute who stand in
need of help is at least as large
again. The Conferences of St. Vincent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
de Paul, the many other charitable
societies, and the pastors, support
and succor quite as many more
families, the greater portion of whom
are also dependent on the public.
And with all this, most societies are
compelled to turn away nearly as
many destitute as they can relieve.
It is therefore not too much to assume
that one tenth of the Parisians
are reduced to the verge of absolute
poverty. And how inadequate, at
the best, is the relief doled out by
the municipality to the poor! A
couple of pounds of bread each week,
a few cast-off garments, occasionally
some bedding, is about all which a
family can usually expect to receive
from this source. In 1866, the city
disbursed, by way of relief, four millions
of francs among 40,644 families,
which gives forty-eight francs and
sixty-five centimes per year for each
family, or eighteen francs and sixty-five
centimes per head. But it
should be borne in mind that bread
sells at one fourth of a franc per
pound, which shows how insignificant
the relief is which the otherwise
so extravagant Paris municipality bestows
on its destitute. And it should
be further remembered that a family
has to pay an average annual rental
of one hundred and forty-one francs
and twenty-five centimes&mdash;which
average was only one hundred and
thirteen francs and forty-five centimes
prior to the year 1860. These
statistics sufficiently demonstrate the
grave importance which the solution
of the social problem threatens to assume
in France.</p>

<p>But there is at least an equally
large number of families who, though
they may not be regular applicants
for municipal and other charity, are
yet unable to get on without undergoing
greater or less privations and
self-denials. It can hardly be believed
how much this wide-spread distress
tends to the demoralization of
the poor. Without education, without
intellectual incentive, without religious
consolation, and even without
a day of rest; constantly fighting for
bare existence; weighed down by
bodily suffering, the better feelings of
these unfortunates have become so
blunted that they think only of gratifying
their unceasing, never quite
satisfied material wants. The disuse
of the Sunday solemnities has weaned
them even from bestowing a proper
care on their persons. They
rarely possess any other dress than
the one worn in the work-shop. Still
worse, if possible, is the state of
the quarters, or holes, in which they
are domiciled. Besides a wretched
couch, an old table, some broken
chairs and crockery, one meets there
nothing but filth and offensive odors.
Parents and children sleep in one
close room; the children run wild in
the streets, and thus deteriorate morally
and mentally before they perish
physically.</p>

<p>Such an element of the population
can only be redeemed morally and
religiously by relief of their material
misery. No amelioration of their
condition is otherwise possible.
Wherever the church desires to interfere,
she must be prepared with
material aid&mdash;must send the Sister
of Mercy as well as the priest.
A sort of brutishness has been engrafted
on this pauperism, and until it is
eliminated no improvement can be
seriously attempted. When modern
science, therefore, represents man as a
purely animal organism, the conclusion
is perhaps not so very illogical after
all. By systematically degrading
the disinherited working classes into
a race of human beings inferior in
many essential features to the savage,
modern political economy has to a
certain extent furnished this theory
with an illustration. The savage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
still experiences the necessity of prayer,
a want which the modern proletarian
has long ceased to feel; the religious
necessity is either dulled or destroyed
in him, because the religious
sentiment has been torn from his
heart. For this reason also the reconciliation
of the proletarian with
Christianity is frequently surrounded
by far greater difficulties than the
conversion of the downright heathen.
The Christian, corrupted by our so-called
progress, stands perhaps lowest
in the scale of humanity.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the craving for
sensual indulgences seems to have
become so general among the higher
class of working-men that there are
few who lead a well-regulated, frugal,
quiet life. It is, no doubt, difficult to
resist the manifold temptations which
Paris presents, and which are intensified
by the frequent financial and industrial
revulsions. All the more remunerative
trades are subject to periods
of stagnation, during which numbers
of operatives are thrown out of employment,
or work only half-time. The
self-denial which they have then to
practise leads them afterward to make
up for it by dissipation, and they
thus contract habits which end in
ruin. Here we see again, and most
distinctly in Paris, what immense influence
a nation's political economy
exerts on its religious and moral character.
Nowhere are the fruits of the
mischief committed by the politico-economical
theories now ascendant
in France to be observed more plainly
than in the metropolis, a city
in which at least one half of the
population, if not permanently in
want, are certainly always in danger
of it.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, it is
all the more cheering that so large
a number of working-men's families
should have preserved their Christian
faith and still attend to their religious
duties. A more than ordinary
amount of virtue and self-denial is
required for it, and those who practise
them amidst the vicissitudes of
life are truly noble souls. Yet there
exist many such even among the poorest
and lowliest. Another guarantee
of a brighter future is that nearly all
working-men appear fully convinced
of the necessity of an education, and
that they therefore rarely object to
having their children instructed.
Even the most irreligious among
them manifest an implicit confidence
in the clergy, and prefer to have
their children attend the schools controlled
by the religious. Though
pretending to care nothing for the
church themselves, they deem religion
an excellent thing for their families.
With the steady improvement
in the system of popular education,
and with the diffusion of schools superintended
by the church, a corresponding
advance in the religious
and moral condition of the masses
may be expected, and is indeed already
apparent. There are in Paris
53 schools for boys attended by 17,360
pupils, which are managed by
the different religious orders, and 63
schools for boys attended by 16,750
pupils, conducted by laymen. Of
the schools for girls 68, with 19,720
pupils, are controlled by the sisters,
and 57, with 12,630, by lay instructresses.
The elementary Protestant
establishments are included in the
above figures. A similar ratio exists
between the intermediate and the
higher schools.</p>

<p>To form an adequate idea of the
superior advantages which the different
religious orders possess as educators,
it should be known that, while
the city of Paris pays its elementary
lay teachers yearly from 2000 fr. to
3000 fr. salary, besides giving them
lodgings and a retiring pension, the
brothers have only 950 fr., lodgings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
but no pension. The female lay
teachers, mostly single, receive from
1800 fr. to 2400 fr. per annum, while
the sisters have only 800 fr. In this
comparison we made no mention of
the difference in the expense of the
lodgings, which is much larger in the
case of laymen, most of whom have
families. The city of Paris could
therefore well afford, without incurring
the reproach of any especial extravagance,
to present the church with a
large piece of ground and a sum of
money for a building where the
superannuated brothers could pass
the rest of their days. The evening
classes for adults, which have been
opened under the auspices of the
church, are quite a success.</p>

<p>The chair rent exacted in the
French churches is no doubt a disadvantage
to religion; for it always
thins the audience more or less.
Though the sum collected is a trifle,
and especially when we consider the
recklessness with which the Parisians
spend their money, many good and
thoughtful men object to the practice
on principle. Indeed, the tide of
popular opinion seems set against
the tax, and it certainly suggests to
the sceptic an unpleasant parallel
between the theatre and the sanctuary.
Those who cannot afford the
expense of hiring a chair during the
service must stand up, or kneel, or occupy
one of the benches fastened to
the walls. The poor man goes, however,
to church to forget the outside
world. And yet it is there, in the
very place where all should be equal,
where rich and poor, high and low,
should be esteemed alike, that his
poverty is thrust into his face, that he
is again reminded of the difference
between him and his more fortunate
fellows. There are many so extremely
poor in Paris that even a few sous
are an object to them. This explains
why the few mission churches, in
which no charge is made for chairs,
attract such large crowds, principally
composed of working-men, who are
otherwise rarely, if ever, seen at worship.
On this account, several of the
parish churches in Paris have lately
been so arranged that no rent is exacted.
To do away with the system
entirely is, however, not feasible at
once. Some provision will first have
to be made to replace the considerable
revenue which accrues from this
source not only to the parishes, but
also to the dioceses. If the obstacles
in the way to the acquisition of property
by the church, the acceptance
of legacies, and the accumulation of
means from similar sources, were less
formidable, this reform might perhaps
be introduced in a comparatively
brief period. But owing to legislative
restrictions, bequests and other love-gifts
can only be accepted by the
church after long-protracted and expensive
proceedings ingeniously invented
for the benefit of the bureaucratic
hierarchy. Had Napoleon
III., instead of spending many hundreds
of millions on the metamorphosis
of his capital, devoted only
one hundred millions to the erection
of a dozen large parish churches and
the endowment of the rest, he might
have obtained a more substantial
guarantee for the preservation of his
throne and dynasty than the strategic
streets which now traverse Paris. At
any rate, this much is certain: with
the abolition of chair-rent in the
churches the attendance at divine
service, and consequently the religious
sentiment, might be greatly
stimulated. It is also to be hoped
that juster views in relation to the
restoration of the sanctity of Sunday
may obtain the ascendency in due
time. As regards the latter subject,
the example set by the government
in suspending hereafter all public
works on holidays and Sundays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
would of itself have a very happy influence
on the national morality.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the church chairs are
rented to families and paid for yearly
or half-yearly, this evil is less glaring
in the provinces. The wealthier parishioners
there usually try to secure
places in front, often at high rents,
which renders it possible to let the
remainder more cheaply, sometimes
at mere nominal prices, to the poorer
classes.</p>

<p>What we have stated above applies,
in many respects, equally to the
larger provincial cities, among which
Lyons, Marseilles, Nantes, and Toulouse
deserve special mention for
their religious zeal. Nor are Rouen,
Strasbourg, Bordeaux, Lille, and Metz
indifferent to the success of the
church. The other large and small
cities may be judged according to
the state of their respective provinces.
One thing may, however, be safely
depended upon, namely, that every
city contains a circle of laymen which
sets a praiseworthy example in religious
conduct and social Christian
deportment. The women cling,
nearly everywhere, with deeper devotion
to the church than the men, and
in the provinces even more than in
Paris. The most devout of spirit are
the German provinces, Alsace, Lothringen,
and Flanders, as well as
Brittany, Auvergne, Limouisin, Dauphiné,
and the provinces south and
west, where most if not all the adults
fulfil the precept of Easter communion.
Least devout are perhaps
the provinces in the vicinity of Paris,
Normandy, Champagne, Picardie,
Orleans, down into the very heart of
France, as far as Tours and Bourges.
Within a radius of about sixty miles
from Paris, the condition of the
villages is truly deplorable, and in
the towns, the religious sentiment is
only very slowly awakened. There
are localities where Sunday is even
more habitually disregarded than
at the capital; and if the men go
occasionally to church, they rarely
partake of the Holy Sacrament.
This state of things is, however, an
exceptional one, and especially in the
villages near Paris which send their
vegetables, flowers, fruits, and other
produce to market. The daily contact
of the peasantry with metropolitan
life has had a bad effect on
their morals. At these points the
church is chiefly attended by Parisians
who spend a portion of the year
at their villas.</p>

<p>But while we feel constrained to
admit that there is a great deal of
religious indifference among the male
population, it is pleasant to feel justified
in saying that France is able to
boast of a large body of ecclesiastics
whose zeal and piety must command
the genuine admiration of the Catholic
world. In the year 1865, there
were only 837 vacancies in the 31,388
parishes into which France is divided.
The budget for 1869 appropriates
salaries for the incumbents of 106
new parishes, and 50 new vicarages.
The ecclesiastics in France number
45,000&mdash;a very high percentage in a
population of thirty-eight millions,
of whom about a million are non-Catholics.
At the same time, the pay
is very small. Not half the parish
priests have an income exceeding
1500 francs per annum, while several
thousands have no more than 1200,
(two hundred and forty dollars in gold.)
Only the incumbents of the comparatively
few parishes of the first
and second classes&mdash;numbering little
above 3000 all told&mdash;have an addition
of from 1200 to 1500 francs
yearly from the state. The income
of the canons varies from 1600 to
1800 francs, rarely reaching 2400,
and this leaves them partly dependent
on mass stipends and casuals.
Many bishops are obliged to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
extra allowances out of their own
pockets to the canons of their cathedrals.
The archbishops, who are
also senators and cardinals with extra
pay attached to these dignities, enjoy
large revenues, ranging from 120,000
to 150,000 francs, all of which they
sorely need. Mons. Morlot, the
late Cardinal Archbishop of Paris,
imperial land almonier and peer of
France, had an annual income of
230,000 francs. Of this sum he had,
however, set aside from the beginning
30,000 francs for distribution among
the Paris poor. Although this estimable
prince of the church enjoyed
his income for several years, he left
not enough at his death to bury him,
and the expenses of his funeral had
to be paid by the emperor. The
demands on the purses of these high
ecclesiastics are so heavy that they
are constrained to practise the most
rigid economy, unless they possess
independent fortunes. The household
of a French bishop or archbishop
usually consists of a private
secretary, a coachman, a man-servant,
and a cook, who is generally the wife
of the coachman or servant. His
house, furniture, carriage, are all of the
plainest description. A bishop does
not entertain what is called company.
On special occasions he may invite
some clergymen to his table, but
nothing more. If business calls him
to Paris, or some other place outside
of his diocese, he takes his secretary
with him, and puts up at one of those
quiet hotels patronized by religious.
When away from home, he always appears
in public either on foot or in some
hired conveyance. Now and then
he accepts an invitation from some
Christian family, and calls on Catholic
laymen who have attested their
zeal by word or deed. The most
distinguished prelates often love to
surprise the offices of the Parisian
journals, such as the <cite>Monde</cite> and the
<cite>Univers</cite>, by a visit, when they request
the different writers to be
presented to them, throw out valuable
suggestions, and converse with the
greatest freedom and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonhomie</i>.
This cordial intercourse between
bishops, priests, and laymen has contributed
no little toward the glory of
the church and the efficiency of the
Catholic press. Except in the sanctuary
itself, the Catholic Church in
France is utterly devoid of pomp and
splendor, and by far the largest part
of her resources is set aside for the
maintenance of numerous educational,
charitable, and other benevolent
establishments, at which it may be
interesting in this connection to cast
here a brief glance.</p>

<p>First in importance and influence
are the Conferences of St. Vincent de
Paul, founded at Paris in the beginning
of the third decade of the present
century. In the metropolis
alone are eighty odd conferences, one
for each parish, besides some national
and special ones connected with various
other religious institutions and
associations. Among the national
conferences may be instanced a Polish,
a Flemish, an Italian, an English,
and two German. The most prominent
of the special conferences are
the Cercle du Luxembourg, formed by
the Catholic students, and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cercle
de la Jeunesse</span>, formed by the youth
of the higher schools. The total
number of members is probably over
4000. In addition to this, many
other religious associations have been
directly and indirectly promoted by
the Conferences of St. Vincent de
Paul: for instance, the patronages for
promoting the physical and spiritual
welfare of apprentices; the work-shops
for young girls belonging to the
working classes, who are not only
furnished with employment, but instructed
in their religious duties; the
society for the relief of the Faubourgs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
managed by women whose object is
the education of the children of
laboring people who reside in the
wretched hovels of the remoter suburbs.
The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Société Maternelle</span>, established
in 1788, which has in every
quarter of the city its female agent to
relieve working-women who cannot
afford to remain at home to nurse
their infants. This society expends
over 60,000 francs a year, and relieves
nearly a thousand mothers. A
similar society is that of the Crèches,
where infants under three years of age
are taken care of while their mothers
earn their daily bread. One of the
greatest evils of our modern system
of economy is the compulsory labor
of females. There are in Paris
106,300 working-women who earn
on an average only 1 franc and
10 centimes per day, (twenty-two
cents in gold,) and have to support
a family on this pittance. Very
excellent institutions are the Salles
d'Asiles, play-schools for children aged
from two to six years, which already
number over 4000 in France, and are
attended by hundreds and thousands
of children. The Child's Friend
Society is designed to save those
children who are in danger of
being demoralized by the evil example
of their parents. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Société de
St. François Regis</span> aims to counteract
the illicit relations but too frequently
entered into between the
opposite sexes. It labors to supply
the poor who flock to the capital
from every part of the provinces
with the documents which the law
requires for the solemnization of a legal
marriage. The advocates of the
civil marriage contract may learn
from this the beauties of the system
which they praise so highly. Nothing
can be more expensive, troublesome,
or attended with greater loss
of time, than the legalization of the
different papers required to be produced
before a marriage can be ratified
by the civil authorities. On the
other hand, the church exacts only a
few and simple formalities to unite a
pair in the bonds of holy wedlock.
This society was founded in 1826,
and in 1866 it brought about the
marriages of no less than 43,256 couples,
who had previously lived together
without being married.</p>

<p>Paris contains fifty-eight nunneries,
the greater part of which make the
education of the young and the care
of the infirm and the aged their main
occupation. The nuns also tend the
sick in twenty-four out of the thirty-six
public hospitals in Paris. An order
of more modern origin, but one
that has already accomplished much
good, is that of the Sisters of St. Paul,
for the blind of their own sex. Most
of its members are blind themselves;
but their proficiency in all domestic
employments is such that their pupils
are taught to excel in them. The
founder of this order, a Parisian widow,
has done for this class of the
afflicted what the famous Abbé de
l'Grée has done for the deaf and
dumb. The sisters are principally
taken from the ranks of the pupils
who cannot be otherwise provided
for. This institution is already self-supporting.
The Little Sisters of the
Poor, founded in 1840, at St. Servan,
near St. Malo, in Brittany, have in
Paris alone five large establishments
with 1700 sisters, where they support
in comfort 11,006 aged poor. Its members
solicit broken victuals in the
kitchens of the rich, and unsold vegetables
from the market-hucksters,
which they take home in small carts
drawn by donkeys. They also take
up collections on stated days at the
doors of the churches. Not content
with constituting themselves the
guardians of the helpless, they also
relieve them of the trouble and humiliation
of soliciting alms. Is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
this conduct worthy of the best days of
Christianity? Though not yet quite
thirty years old, the Little Sisters of
the Poor are already widely known
and honored. Recruited at first
from the lowest classes of society,
many women of the higher have latterly
joined the order, though the
majority of the sisters are still working-women
and servant-girls. We
would here incidentally remark that
the French servant-girls rank far
above those of the other continental
countries in a moral and religious
point of view. This is mainly due to
the strictness with which good behavior
and chastity are enforced in all
French households, where no promiscuous
intercourse between the sexes
is countenanced. However indifferent
master and mistress may themselves
be to religion, they nevertheless
invariably insist that their servants
should be regular communicants
and church-goers. The status
of the female domestics is therefore
higher than that of the average working-woman,
whose independence of
control but too often proves her ruin.
This also explains why servant-girls
should be so much more eagerly
sought in marriage than working-girls.
In France, the domestic, and
especially the female one, is treated
almost as a member of the family.
The difference between master and
servant is not so marked, and the result
is that the latter has more self-respect
and pride. Indeed, the manner
in which servants are treated by
their employers in France is a highly
creditable feature in the national character.</p>

<p>But to return to the religious and
other societies. A very useful association
is a woman's society founded
by a dozen ladies, "Invalid Working-Woman's
Aid Society," which numbers
in 27 parishes 600 members, and cordially
co-operates with the sisters of St.
Vincent de Paul in visiting and tending
the sick in their own habitations.
In 1865, its members had paid 158,368
sick calls to 52,748 sufferers.
Another female society attends the
sick poor in the public hospitals, and
seeks to assist feeble convalescent
girls and boys in procuring employment.
"The Church Aid Society"
furnishes churches destitute of means
with vestments worked by the hands
of its members. Still another society
of women keeps on hand stocks of
clothing for the needy, its members
sewing for this purpose several hours
each day. One society has set itself
the laudable task of returning to their
relatives and friends the destitute
and forsaken orphans who have
come with their families to the city
from the provinces. Several orphan
schools have been opened for the
same purpose by laymen and the
rural clergy in different parts of
France. Many of the orders labor
to a similar end, especially that of
the Trappists, who own now twenty-two
extensive agricultural settlements,
mostly in France, some of them with
a hundred brothers. Some of the
most barren and unhealthy districts
were taken in hand by the Trappists,
and the results which they there
achieved are really marvellous. At
the abbey of Staoueli, in Algeria,
they fed during the last famine 600
Arabs a day for several months, without
materially lessening the provisions
sent for sale to the markets. Though
the brothers work from ten to twelve
hours daily, besides devoting several
hours at night to their religious duties,
they eat nothing but bread, (1&frac12; lbs.
per diem,) vegetables seasoned with
salt, and drink only water. The
Bernhardines also follow agriculture;
but their rules are less severe, for
they are permitted to use milk, fish,
and a little wine. Four flourishing
settlements have been established by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
this order in the most sterile districts
of Southern France. The Brothers
of the Holy Ghost (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Frères du Saint
Esprit</span>) make foreign missionary enterprises
and the amelioration of the
condition of the convicts their specialty.
The Brothers of St. Joseph
educate the deaf and dumb, and the
Brothers of St. Gabriel vagrant boys.
The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">&OElig;uvre des Campagnes</span> is a society
which strives to provide for the
spiritual and material wants of the
poorer rural parishes. Its main object
is to awaken the dormant religious
feelings by popular missions,
devotional works, etc. Several societies
have been organized in Paris
and the provinces for the better observance
of Sunday. The societies
called "Reunion of the Holy Family"
consist of the poor who meet on
Sundays in chapels and halls for
mutual instruction and prayers. A
special society under the patronage
of St. Michael has charged itself with
the distribution of pious publications,
tracts, etc. The colossal missionary
enterprise of France is well known.
No nation furnishes so many missionaries,
gives such large contributions
as the French, a people among
whom a century ago the Catholic religion
was, during several years, formally
abolished. Of the 8000 missionaries
distributed over the globe more
than one third are Frenchmen. The
Lyons-Paris Society for the Propagation
of the Faith extends all over the
earth, and possessed in 1867 an income
of 5,149,918 fr., of which sum
3,582,659 fr. had been collected in
French dioceses. During the preceding
year the Society of the Holy
Infancy could afford to disburse
1,603,200 fr. for 59 missions supported
by it alone. It has baptized 383,206
children, and educated 41,226 more.</p>

<p>A separate mission exists for the
Holy Land and the Orient, (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">&OElig;uvre
des Ecoles d'Orient</i>.) The society
mainly applies itself to supplying the
missions established in these regions
by the Franciscans and Lazarists with
money and other aid. The return of
the Nestorians, Armenians, and other
eastern schismatics to the bosom of
the mother church is one of its principal
objects, and has already made
considerable progress.</p>

<p>It must seem almost incredible that
the greater number of these benevolent
and religious societies should enjoy
no fixed or only very inadequate
revenues. Yet such is actually the
fact. Except their buildings, many
of which are heavily mortgaged, very
few of the societies have any property
or capital. Under these circumstances
it naturally requires the most
untiring exertions and the closest
economy to sustain themselves.
Aside from the regular collections in
the churches, these organizations are
mainly dependent on the charity
sermons, by which funds are raised, as
well as on the lotteries and bazaars
gotten up for religious and charitable
purposes. We see therefore that
they have had a severe struggle
for existence. The church is the only
institution in France which can never
be centralized, and the future belongs
for this reason all the more surely to
her.</p>

<p>These results show the great and
many-sided activity of the French Catholics.
There is no known ailing or
misery, no human evil, caused by our
short-sighted legislation or social policy,
which is not met and alleviated by
the church and her servants. These
efforts may not be crowned with the
desired success in all instances; but
when we consider the opposition
which every religious project encounters
in France, it must be confessed
that the church has accomplished
more in that country than in any
other. Nor should it be forgotten
that this is largely owing to a fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
which neither the sophistries of modern
scepticism nor the equality of all denominations
under the constitution
of the empire can do away with,
namely, that the Catholic Church
still remains the national one. For
the same reason we venture to predict
that the occurrence of any extraordinary
events, of any great public calamity,
would rather tend to promote
than retard the growth of the religious
sentiment among the masses.
It is a remarkable circumstance that
in times of national distress and suffering,
the attachment to the church
is strengthened. Never were the
sanctuaries so crowded as during the
disturbances of 1848 and 1849. How
many of those who had until then
worked for the overthrow of church
and state were not converted when
they saw whither their principles led
them? Will this not again be the
case at the next revolution? It
often requires such violent shocks to
check the baneful passions and to
open the eyes of the people.</p>

<h2>THE TOTAL ECLIPSE OF AUGUST SEVENTH.</h2>


<p>The recent solar discoveries, of
which mention has been made in
past numbers of this magazine, have
on the whole increased the interest
attached to the observation of eclipses,
though in some respects the importance
of these phenomena as opportunities
of extending our knowledge
of the constitution of the sun
has been diminished. It will be remembered
that immediately after the
total eclipse of last year in India, it
was found that the great prominences
on the rim of the sun which are
never seen with any ordinary appliances,
except on these occasions,
could be observed at any time with
the spectroscope, and that by means
of this admirable instrument their
shape as well as the spectral lines indicating
their chemical composition
could be determined; and since that
time many observations of them
have been made, and interesting conclusions
arrived at on both these
points, as stated in the article translated
in the last number. The principal
ones as yet established with certainty
are, that they are gaseous, and
mainly composed of hydrogen, and
that they change their shape with astonishing
rapidity, some of their particles
perhaps moving with the inconceivable
velocity of one hundred
miles a second. At any rate, immensely
energetic forces and rapid
movements must be required to
change essentially the shape and position
of these masses&mdash;which often
have ten times the diameter, or a
thousand times the volume of the
earth&mdash;in a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>So we are not now obliged to wait
a year or more and travel several
thousand miles to observe for a few
minutes these peculiar and still somewhat
mysterious bodies; still, it does
not follow that they cannot be better
examined at the time of an eclipse,
or that new appearances may not be
noticed on such occasions, now
that we are accustomed to these,
from which the other more startling
phenomena for a long time diverted
attention. Success has excited hope
of yet greater successes; and eclipses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
though affording but a short time for
actual observation, are undoubtedly
the best occasions for the observer to
learn in what direction his labors
should be turned. There are also
other things, such as the corona,
Baily's beads, possible new planets
inside of the orbit of Mercury, etc.,
which can only be seen at these
times.</p>

<p>The eclipse of this year, therefore,
was by no means neglected by the
scientific men of the United States;
in fact, it was felt that the reputation
of the country depended upon the
skill shown in preparing for and in
observing it, and a large number of
parties were formed, to be stationed
at various points of the path of the
moon's shadow or line of totality, so
that if clouds should prevent success
at one place, it might be obtained at
another.</p>

<p>The first point touched by the shadow
proper, and at which consequently
a total eclipse occurred, was
in longitude 165° west from Washington,
latitude 53° north, being in
Siberia; the last, in longitude 10° east,
latitude 31° north, being off the
coast of North Carolina. At the
former the sun rose totally obscured
at half-past four, at the latter
it set in that condition, at a
quarter to seven; and at the intermediate
points the eclipse took
place at all the intermediate hours of
the day. It is rather singular that,
owing to the necessary skip of a day
in going round the world, it was
<em>Sunday</em> morning in Siberia, but <em>Saturday</em>
afternoon in the United States;
so that the eclipse may be said to
have been one of the longest on record.
Its actual duration was, however
quite short, half-past four <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>
in Siberia, and a quarter to seven
<span class="smcap">P.M.</span> at the ending point, being about
four and half-past six <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> respectively
in New York; giving an interval
of two and a half hours in which
the shadow passed over the long line
connecting these points, which it will
be perceived are nearly opposite in
longitude.</p>

<p>If it had travelled by the shortest
route, it would have passed within
three degrees of the north pole, and
the eclipse would have been invisible
in this country; but, fortunately, it
lengthened its course, reaching its
highest latitude near Behring's Straits,
which it crossed, and then swept to
the south-east, crossing the territories
of Montana and Dakota, and
the States of Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois,
Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee,
Virginia, and North Carolina. It
could hardly have taken a better
route for us.</p>

<p>The length of the line was over
seven thousand miles, and the consequent
average velocity in passing
over it about fifty miles a minute,
though in the United States it exceeded
that amount considerably. The
breadth of the belt traversed was
somewhat variable; in this country
it was about one hundred and fifty
miles. Of course, the sun was partially
hidden by the moon over a
very large portion of the globe; but
the region from which its light was at
any time completely excluded was
comparatively quite small.</p>

<p>Observers stationed themselves at
numerous points, even as far west as
Alaska and Siberia; but of course
most chose positions within the United
States. The writer was connected
with a party which was established
at Shelbyville, Kentucky.</p>

<p>The general diffusion of intelligence,
both subjective and objective,
as we may say, had of course excited
great interest in the eclipse among
the people, especially in that part of
the country actually within or bordering
upon the limits of totality;
and though, of course, the nature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the expected event was fully understood
by all the educated portion of
the community, and by many of the
uneducated, still there were some,
especially in the rural districts, who
vaguely apprehended some great
event, to be probably of a disastrous
nature, (a hailstorm was the most popular;)
and perhaps were as much terrified
in anticipation as any entirely
ignorant people have ever been at
the actual occurrence of this most
impressive and sublime spectacle.</p>

<p>Of course, excursions were planned
by railroad companies and others to
points on the line of the shadow, the
usual directions for observing were extensively
circulated, and the eclipse was
made the catch-word for many advertisements
whose substance had no
connection with it. We are afraid
that many persons may have lost the
most beautiful features of the scene
by a too persistent use of smoked
glass, which of course was not necessary
during or even near the time of
the total obscuration.</p>

<p>The weather for some days previous
was not very promising&mdash;not on
account of too much rain, but owing
to the absence of it; and every evening
the sun set in a bank of haze,
which each day seemed to increase,
and no storm occurred to clear the
air of the burden accumulated by the
drought. This was particularly unpromising
for the photographers, who
needed really clear air for good work;
the times of beginning and ending, to
which, formerly, great importance was
attached, could probably have been
observed nearly or quite as well
through haze, or even thin cloud.</p>

<p>We have just implied that less consequence
is now attached to the time
observations than was formerly the
case; this is due to the great perfection
which the lunar and solar theories
have now attained, which is such
that the prediction of the positions of
the sun and moon, and even of the
beginning and ending of an eclipse,
can be made with greater accuracy,
perhaps, than almost any one observer
could note them. Still, by
combination of all the results, some
slight corrections to the tables now
used may perhaps be deduced, and on
the present occasion this portion of
the work was not disregarded, but
provided for with all the appliances
of modern science.</p>

<p>The recording of time is now
usually made by the electric method,
which may be here described briefly,
though many are probably familiar
with it. The principle is the following,
subject to various modifications
in the particular form of apparatus:
A line is described by a pen made to
move uniformly over the paper by
means of clock-work. That this line
may be indefinitely prolonged without
retracing, it is usual to make it a
spiral round a horizontal cylinder,
which revolves, say, once a minute,
while the marking-pen (otherwise
stationary) moves slowly from one
end of the cylinder to the other,
perhaps requiring several hours for
the complete passage.</p>

<p>The pen making this line is held
in its place by the action of an electro-magnet
pulling against a spring; the
circuit through this magnet is broken
every second by the escapement of a
clock or chronometer; the magnet
then for an instant ceases to act, and
the spring pulls the pen aside, making
a break in the line at regular intervals
corresponding to every second of
time. The same interruption of the
circuit can also be made by an observer
provided with a key like those
used by telegraph operators, and the
time of his observation thus registered
on the chronograph, as the instrument
is called. For identification of the
clock-mark preceding his observation,
mechanical arrangements can easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
be devised, by which the first second
in each minute shall be omitted, the
circuit not being broken; so that it
will be known what second of every
minute each mark corresponds to;
and the fraction of the second elapsed
from this clock-mark to his own can
easily be estimated by the eye, or
measured more carefully. The reading
of the record is, of course, facilitated
by having the cylinder revolve
once a minute, so that all the clock-marks
answering to any particular
second (as the twenty-third, for example,
of each minute) will come in
the same horizontal row; and the
marks are not made on the cylinder
itself, but on a sheet of paper fastened
round it, which can be detached when
filled.</p>

<p>Instruments of this character were
used at Shelbyville, and also at the
border stations near the edge of the
path of the shadow, but inside of it,
one of which was at Falmouth, about
thirty miles south of Cincinnati, the
other at Oakland, near the Mammoth
Cave. The observations of time were
especially important at these places,
since, as will readily be seen, the
length of time required for a circular
or elliptical shadow to pass a point
near its edge will vary very rapidly
for a slight change in the size of the
shadow, or a slight shifting of its path
toward or from the point selected.
Even rough observations, merely of
the duration of the eclipse, made at
two such stations on opposite sides of
the central line, suffice to determine
with great accuracy the dimensions
and precise track of the shadow, and
thus give the elements of the moon's
motion.</p>

<p>We have just spoken of the shadow
as being elliptical; this was of
course the case, the sun being quite
low at the time, so that the round
cone of darkness, technically known
as the umbra, was cut very obliquely
at the earth's surface. To realize the
amount of this ellipticity or distortion,
one would only need to hold some
spherical body so as to cast a shadow
on the ground about an hour and a
half before sunset. The elongation
was also continually increasing as the
sun sunk toward the horizon, and its
direction changed as the sun at the
same time changed its direction or
bearing, the longer axis of the ellipse
always pointing toward the sun.
This axis was, in Kentucky, about
three hundred miles long; the shorter
ninety; and this elliptical patch of
darkness was moving in a course
some thirty degrees south of east, or
about twenty-three degrees south of
its own longer diameter; its speed
was about seventy-five miles a minute,
or more than the average
on the whole track, as before stated,
and it required rather less than three
minutes to pass any given point
on the central line; this was consequently
the duration of the totality;
and short enough it certainly was, for
the amount of work which was to be
done by the observers.</p>

<p>For the stations on or near the
central line, it was important to obtain
the absolute times of the contacts,
and for this purpose transits
were observed, to get the error and
rate of the chronometer, for some
time before and after the eclipse.
The border observations locate the
path on which the shadow travels,
and determine its breadth; but to
obtain the position of the shadow on
this path at any fixed time, the true
times of its arrival and departure at
fixed points must be observed. But
on the border no such preparations
were necessary, only the interval
being required; and a simple pendulum,
without clock-work, was set up
for this purpose, which broke the
circuit at each second, and thus left
its record, serving to count the number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
of seconds and the fraction
between the beginning and end
of the totality, which were observed
and similarly recorded by means of a
break-circuit key. This pendulum was
so arranged as to break the circuit on
the main telegraph line, and thus to
be heard, and record its beats at a
number of stations in different towns;
but the main circuit did not itself
mark upon the registers used by
the observers, but mechanically (by
means of what is called a relay magnet)
broke short circuits set up at
their stations, which could also be
broken in another place by their own
keys, without, of course, interfering
with the main circuit itself; so that
every observer could receive the pendulum
beats upon his own record,
without receiving those made by
observers at other stations.</p>

<p>On Thursday afternoon, the 5th
of August, some showers occurred,
but not sufficient, according to ordinary
experience, to have much effect
in clearing the atmosphere; and on
Friday morning the sky became overcast
with mackerel clouds of a most
unpromising character. All the preparations
were, however, hopefully continued,
and the photographer, Mr.
Whipple, of Boston, took on that day
some very successful views of Shelbyville,
of the college buildings, and of
the party of observers. The principal
station had been established in the
grounds of the college, the instruments
being protected by a large
tent; close by was the Coast Survey
station, where the chronographs just
described for recording time, as well
as a transit instrument for observing
it, had been placed.</p>

<p>Friday evening was cloudy at
Shelbyville, but without rain, and the
chance seemed to be gradually diminishing
of any thing like a good
observation of the eclipse.</p>

<p>The plans for photographing the
successive phases were most perfect.
The movement of the sun from east
to west of course made it necessary
that the plate should also move correspondingly,
but this was readily
accomplished by connecting it with
a telescope mounted on an axis parallel
to the earth's equator, which
axis is itself fixed to another at right
angles to it, or parallel to that of
the earth; this second axis being
turned by clock-work once in twenty-four
hours in a direction opposite to
that of the earth's rotation, all the
parts of the instrument evidently follow
the movement of the heavens or
of any celestial object to which the
telescope may be directed. The axis
around which the telescope turns
can be rotated by hand or clamped
in position, and in connection with
the other, which can be disengaged
from the clock-work, enables the instrument
to be pointed in any direction
at pleasure. This style of
mounting is known as the equatorial,
and is almost always used for astronomical
telescopes. It is similar to
the ordinary tripod used for small
instruments, except in the addition
of clock-work, and in having the
principal axis inclined toward the
pole-star instead of being vertical.</p>

<p>But it was necessary not only to
take photographs, but to know the
time at which they were taken, that
they might accurately measure the
movement of the lunar disc over that
of the sun. This might have been
secured by simply noting them from
the face of the chronometer; but the
object was more neatly and certainly
attained by having the slide itself, as
it dropped at the end of the exposure,
break the electric circuit, and
record its own time on the chronograph.</p>

<p>The spectroscopic work was the
most difficult and important of all.
Professor Winlock, the director of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Harvard College Observatory and
chief of the party, had charge of this.
Though, as above stated, it has been
found that the prominences can be
seen with the spectroscope at any
time, still the probability that they
could be better observed at the time
of the eclipse than at other times
made it a duty to try the experiment,
and the result has, as will soon be
seen, proved that such is the case.
Another observation was obtained
with a spectroscope at Bardstown.</p>

<p>A large number of persons had
come in, some from considerable distances,
to observe the expected phenomenon.
Among them was Mr.
Frankenstein, of Springfield, Ohio, an
artist, who hoped to paint the appearance
of the eclipse and its effect
on the landscape. This seemed an
admirable idea, and it is quite remarkable
that attempts of this kind have
not been previously made; as they
have not, at least to our knowledge.
The circumstances of the present one
made it eminently suitable for pictorial
effect, owing to the small altitude
of the sun; and the landscape, seen
from the point selected, (some high
hills east of the town,) is certainly
one of great beauty.</p>

<p>The clouds broke away at about
midnight and the thermometer fell
considerably, reading about 59 at
sunrise. The observing party improved
the opportunity for final adjustments
of instruments and preparatory
observations, and hope revived
in the hearts of all.</p>

<p>The sun rose unobscured on the
morning of the 7th, and the day was
cloudless till about ten o'clock, when
some small cumuli drifted for about
an hour across the sky, which then
resumed its unbroken blue. The
weather was also delightfully cool
with a light breeze, which increased
in the afternoon, and at four was
blowing quite freshly. There were no
signs of the predicted hailstorm, and
strong faith would certainly have
been needed for one to retain a belief
of its arrival.</p>

<p>As the prospect of fine weather
improved, and in fact seemed almost
certain, the people, citizens and
strangers, assembled on the observatory
hill, and a rope was drawn round
the tent where the instruments were
mounted, to prevent a natural but
dangerous curiosity on the part of
those not immediately engaged in
the special observations.</p>

<p>Every one now felt that they would
be fully repaid for the time and labor
devoted to the journey.</p>

<p>At about half-past four the edge
of the sun was visibly indented;
some persons maintained that they
could see the moon some time previous
to the contact; but this must
probably be ascribed to a lively imagination.
Smoked glass now came
into demand, and all eyes were anxiously
watching the rapidly decreasing
orb. I had secured, through the
kindness of an influential friend, an
excellent position on the court-house,
itself a high building and situated on
the highest point in the town, commanding
a fine view in all directions,
particularly toward the north-west,
from which quarter the shadow was
sweeping toward us at the rate of
more than a mile every second.</p>

<p>Some five or six gentlemen had
followed me to the roof of the building,
after which the ladder leading to
the cupola was drawn up, to prevent
a general ascent by the crowd below.
At a quarter or twenty minutes past
five, the wind began to abate, and
the darkness was quite noticeable,
and of course from that time continually
increased, the general effect being
like that of moonlight some time
before the totality. The darkness
was much more striking than at any
time during the annular eclipse of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
1854; this was probably owing to
the total absence of any cloud, which
would have reflected and multiplied
the light of the unobscured portion of
the sun, as on that occasion.</p>

<p>A minute or so before the totality,
the complete circle of the moon was
easily visible, with faint brushes of
light streaming from it in all directions,
which were soon to assume
much larger dimensions, and, apparently,
though not really, a greater
brilliancy.</p>

<p>I cast now my eyes to the north-western
horizon, and saw a brick-red
tinge on the sky evidently caused by
the rapidly approaching umbra. The
long-expected moment had come;
the last direct beam from the sun
vanished, and a magnificent corona
of rays, faint, of course, compared
with the solar light, but bright in the
prevailing gloom, shot out round the
disc of the moon. These rays were
prolonged in four directions at right
angles to each other much more than
elsewhere; having in these directions
a length about equal to the sun's diameter,
making the corona or aureola
obviously cruciform in its shape.</p>

<p>Venus and Mercury appeared conspicuously
on opposite sides of the
moon, and Regulus could be seen,
though with some difficulty. Several
other first magnitude stars appeared
in other parts of the sky, Arcturus,
Vega, and Saturn being specially noticed
by the observers at my side;
and undoubtedly fainter ones could
have been easily discerned, could one
have been willing to divert his eyes from
the beautiful sight placed before them,
which seemed to surpass the expectations
of every beholder. To all our party,
I think, it conveyed little or no idea
of horror or dread, but only of inexpressible
beauty. The moon was at
about one sixth of the distance to the
zenith above the horizon, so that no
straining of necks was necessary to
look at it, as it hung over the darkened
landscape. Certainly, as it so
hung or floated, surrounded by the irrepressible
splendor of the great source
of light which lay behind it, and attended
by its two bright planetary
companions, one on each side, it was
no unfit type of the glorious mystery
which the church had just commemorated
on the preceding day. The darkness
was not so great as that of moonlight,
but of course of a somewhat different
character, the light not coming
from one definite direction. I think
it probable that no shadows were cast,
but was too much occupied in other
observations to be sure of this point.
The birds around the building flew
about wildly; and it was said that the
fowls went to roost, and the cows
started for home, and that the cocks
crowed on the reappearance of the
sun.</p>

<p>The eclipse had not lasted many
seconds when I saw, without specially
looking for it, a bright light red or
orange drop on the lower edge of the
moon, which of course was one of
the famous protuberances. It was
easily seen with the naked eye,
though probably many who had not
heard of these appearances did not
notice it. Before the end of the obscuration,
another appeared on the
right where the sun was about to
emerge. A third was also visible to
the telescope above. Possibly they
may have had some connection with
the long rays of the corona.</p>

<p>Before we had fairly begun to satisfy
our curiosity, a well-marked
boundary between the general darkness
and a bright portion of sky to
the north-west gave warning of the
end of the eclipse, and immediately
afterward the sun flashed out on the
right.</p>

<p>The separation of the discs of the
sun and moon during the following
hour was probably carefully observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
by few except the astronomers and
photographers; the moment of interest
had passed, and few cared to do
more than exchange congratulations
on the success of the display. I forgot
to notice whether the corona and
prominences were visible after the totality;
the latter were still seen, according
to accounts received from
elsewhere, and I met with one gentleman
some days afterward who
had seen the great protuberance on
the lower edge of the sun at Shelbyville,
Indiana, a point some fifteen
miles from the outside line of totality;
he had, of course, no previous
suspicion of its existence.</p>

<p>The eclipse was naturally the principal
topic of conversation during the
evening, and every one was anxious
to report his own observations and
learn those of others. I found that
eleven spectral lines had been seen by
Professor Winlock in the great prominence,
some of them characteristic
of the metal magnesium. He saw
only three before and after totality;
thus confirming the idea previously
entertained, that solar eclipses, though
not the only occasions on which
these interesting objects may be seen,
are, with our present apparatus, far the
best. The photographers had taken
some eighty pictures, several during
the totality, and the times of beginning
and ending had been accurately
observed both at Shelbyville and, as
we afterward learned, also at the
stations on the border line, Falmouth
and Oakland; which border observations
give the position and breadth
of the path of the shadow within
some eight or ten rods; the southern
edge can even be determined with
much greater accuracy, owing to a
fortunate selection of the station,
which proved to be extremely near it.
The precise amounts by which these
results differ from the previous computations
have yet to be determined;
but it is probable that the corrections
to the tables now used will be very
small.</p>

<p>An ingenious method of observing
the time of the external contacts, or
beginning and end of the whole
eclipse, was, as I heard, devised by a
gentleman at another station. These
phenomena, especially the first, are
very difficult to observe accurately,
owing to the invisibility of the moon
when off of the sun's disc, and the
waviness of the sun's limb, making it
doubtful that an indentation has been
made in it till it has become quite
deep, which is, of course, some time
after the actual meeting of the two
bodies. He observed it with the
spectroscope by noting the time of
disappearance of one of the lines only
visible on the extreme edge of the
sun's disc.</p>

<p>Every one not engrossed in some
special work had, of course, seen the
planets Venus and Mercury; and
many had seen others of the first
magnitude. The darkness was not
so great as was hoped for by those
who were searching for intra-Mercurial
planets; no candle was necessary
for examining the charts which had
been prepared. One observer at
Shelbyville reported having seen a
star of the third magnitude with the
naked eye, and as he had no previous
knowledge of the existence of
such a star in the place in which he was
looking, the fact seems indubitable.
Dr. B. A. Gould, of Cambridge, who
observed at Burlington, Iowa, has
since informed me that he saw a star
of the fifth magnitude, with a telescope
of five inches aperture, near
the sun; the star is a well-known one,
and the observation shows that, had
any planets of that brilliancy (about
one fiftieth of that of Mercury) been
within three degrees of the sun, within
which limits he was restricted in
his search by the shortness of time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
he would not have failed to detect
them.</p>

<p>"Baily's beads" do not appear to
have been considered as extraordinary
by any of the observers. The limb of
the sun just before the totality was of
course more or less broken up by the
irregularities of that of the moon; but
the fragments had no remarkable appearance;
and this phenomenon, which
has been the subject of so much discussion,
seems probably due to irradiation
and the difficulty of determining
the precise shape of small and
brilliant objects.</p>

<p>An able astronomer, who was the
chief of the party at Oakland, and
who owing to his station being very
near the southern edge of the shadow,
saw them for fifteen or twenty seconds,
says that they presented most clearly
the phenomena which he should expect
to be caused by the irregular contour
of the moon, when its indentations
were exaggerated by irradiation.</p>

<p>No discoveries of equal importance
with M. Janssen's last year have yet
been reported; but as no eclipse has
ever been so thoroughly observed,
the results cannot fail, when thoroughly
collected and compared, to
be of great scientific value.</p>

<h2>RELIGION IN PRISONS.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></h2>


<p>For the last quarter of a century,
a society has existed in this city entitled
the "Prison Association of
New York." It counts among its
members a large number of the wealthy
and influential men of the State.
Its object is to improve our prison
systems and to effect as far as possible
the permanent reformation of our
criminals. With so humane and
Christian an object we most heartily
sympathize.</p>

<p>Its Twenty-fourth Annual Report,
which we recently received, is a very
interesting and comprehensive document.
Accompanying it is a circular
in which we are told that the association
desires "that the public attention
may be directed to this question, and
the public sentiment in relation to it
enlightened and invigorated, so that
our prison systems and our administration
of criminal justice may everywhere
be improved and brought into
harmony with the advancing civilization
of the age."</p>

<p>We shall, therefore, offer a few suggestions
on this subject.</p>

<p>A criminal is a man morally diseased.
As such he should be considered&mdash;as
such be treated. In a right
prison system, the punishment of
past offences should be but the secondary
object; the prevention of
future offences, the main one. No
permanent outward change can be
effected till an inward reformation has
been wrought; and that reformation
must come through mental but especially
through moral development.</p>

<p>We learn from this report, with
much pleasure, that, in the prisons of
the chief States, libraries have been
established; and that, in many of
them, instruction is regularly imparted
to the inmates, through classes
and lectures. Ignorance is a fruitful
source of vice. The Catholic Church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
which alone raised the world from
the intellectual darkness into which,
at the fall of the Roman empire, the
inpouring of northern barbarians had
plunged her, stands to-day the foremost
champion of enlightened Christian
education. She regards knowledge
as an aid to virtue. She courts
the light of science, that in its beams
the truth of her dogmas may appear
with brighter resplendence.</p>

<p>But experience has clearly shown
that virtue is not a necessary consequence
of education&mdash;that moral
does not always follow mental development.
To prove this, we need
not go outside of this report, in
which, page 373, we read the following
words of Amos Pilsbury, "the
Nestor of jailers on this continent;
an officer whose name is almost as
well known in Europe as it is in America":</p>

<p>"Experience has, unhappily, demonstrated
that the possession of education
is not incompatible with the
commission of crimes of every kind;
and we have seen many melancholy
examples of very highly educated
men falling victims to drunkenness
and other degrading vices." Daniel
Webster therefore truthfully said:
"Man is not only an intellectual, but
he is also a moral being; and his religious
feelings and habits require cultivation.
Let the religious element
in man's nature be neglected; let him
be influenced by no higher motive
than low self-interest, and subjected to
no stronger restraints than the limits
of civil authority, and he becomes
the creature of selfish passions and
blind fanaticism. The cultivation of
the religious sentiment represses licentiousness,
incites to general benevolence
and the practical acknowledgment
of the brotherhood of men; inspires
respect for law and order, and
gives strength to the whole social fabric;
at the same time it conducts the
human soul upward to the Author of
its being."</p>

<p>After quoting these words, Rev.
David Dyer, chaplain of the Albany
Penitentiary, adds, page 348: "Of all
the attributes of man, the moral and
religious are the most important and
influential. They, by divine arrangement,
have this precedency. They
are designed to be the mainspring of
thought and action, the director of
the whole man. Let them be neglected,
debased, or treated as of secondary
importance, and the whole
system will be deranged. Readjustment
and reformation will be impossible.
There may, indeed, be induced,
under the power of seclusion or physical
force, a servile fear; perverse
passions may, for a time, be checked,
and the developments of a depraved
will may be staid; but let these appliances
be removed, and it will soon
become apparent that instead of promoting
reformation they have induced
spiritual hardness, recklessness,
and hate, and made the man a more
inveterate slave to his passions and a
greater injury to the state. The
moral and religious improvement of
convicts should, therefore, be the first
and constant aim of all to whose care
they are committed. Their chief efforts
should be directed to the sanctification
of the springs of thought and
action; and this secured, through the
benediction of God, those objects of
Christian solicitude will go forth to
exemplify in virtuous lives the wisdom
and utility of these efforts."</p>

<p>It being plain, therefore, that upon
religious and moral influences chiefly
we must rely for the reformation of
criminals, the question next arises,
What should be the nature of those
influences? Should they be in accordance
with the conscience of the
criminal or not? Should the clergyman
who is to minister to his spiritual
wants, possess his confidence, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
lead him to good, be a clergyman of
his own church, or of a church from
which the prisoner was, is, and will
be throughout life, fundamentally
separated, in thought and feeling?
Should the books which are placed
in his hands, with a view to his moral
improvement, be such as will attract,
because written in accordance
with the principles of his church, and
recommended by its teachers, or
such as will raise suspicion, if they
do not actually repel, because coming
from a doubtful source, and full,
perhaps, of expressions and statements
at variance with his religious
sentiments?</p>

<p>The proper answer to these questions
is, we think, self-evident. No
man who has to build a house on a
foundation already laid begins by attempting
to weaken that foundation.</p>

<p>Last year, in the city of New
York, 46,476 were committed to prison.
Of this number, 28,667, nearly
two thirds, were of foreign birth. A
statistical view of all the prisoners of
the United States, page 149, shows
that twenty-seven per cent of the inmates
belong to the same class. A
large share of these are undoubtedly
Catholics. So, likewise, are many
who are put down as of native birth.</p>

<p>Now, we ask, how much is done
to bring to bear on these unfortunates
the salutary influences of their
own religion?</p>

<p>How many prisons in the United
States have Catholic chaplains? In
how many is a priest invited to minister
at stated times to the spiritual
wants of this great number of inmates?
In how many cases, not so
much in this as in other parts of the
country, is the priest not only not invited,
but with difficulty allowed, if
allowed at all, to say mass and administer
the sacraments of penance
and the eucharist to the prisoners
who are of his own faith?</p>

<p>We read in this report, with much
pleasure, that libraries have been
established in our chief prisons; that
"the aggregate number of volumes
is 15,250;" that "in some States, a
fixed annual sum is appropriated of
the increase of the prison libraries; in
others, additions are made by special
grants. New York appropriates for
her three prisons, $950; Pennsylvania,
for her two, $450; Michigan,
$300; Massachusetts, $200; Connecticut,
$200." Of this large and
annually increasing supply of books,
intended as an aid in the moral
reformation of criminals, of whom
probably one third are Catholics, what
portion is written by Catholics? What
portion is Catholic, either in its tone or
in its teaching? How many of these
books are not more or less <em>anti-Catholic</em>,
and hence repulsive to the religious
feelings of those for whose benefit
they are intended?</p>

<p>We have no desire to make proselytes
in our prisons. We do not wish
to interfere with the religious convictions
of prisoners who do not belong
to our faith; but we claim as a right,
and maintain in the name of justice
and of philanthropy and of true statesmanship,
that our Catholic criminals
should, as far as possible, be attended
by Catholic clergymen and be supplied
with Catholic books. As the Russian
Count Sollohub says, page 572, in
his paper on "The Prison System
of Russia," "Religion is, beyond
contradiction, the first principle of
all human perfection. It is this
alone which consoles, this alone
which replaces the passions by humility,
and a disordered life by a life
without reproach. But every religion
has its forms. Let Catholicism pursue
its propagandism (?) in the prisons&mdash;nothing
better; for this it has
its orators. Let Puritanism shut up
its criminals and cause them to enter
into themselves by the reading of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Bible; it has for that the education
which it gives." And again, page
573, "Missionaries, special brotherhoods,
the enthusiastic propagandists
of Bible societies, and prison visitors
are certainly worthy of the most respectful
sympathy; but they belong
to a different order of ideas."</p>

<p>In reading the article on "Religion
in Prisons," by the Corresponding
Secretary of the Association, Mr. E.
C. Wines, we were much struck by
the following words, page 390: "The
benefit to convicts is obvious and
incalculable of frequent conversation
with an earnest, kind, godly, sympathizing,
and judicious chaplain, when
the prisoner can express his feelings
and the pastor can give his counsels
and admonitions, with no one by to
check the free outpourings of the
heart on either side. One special
reason for such visits and conversations
is, that the chaplain is thereby
enabled the better to direct his inquiries
and instructions to each prisoner's
particular case."</p>

<p>Here the gentleman has, perhaps
without knowing it, clearly depicted
a <i>Catholic confession</i>. Catholic prisoners
will thus open their hearts to
a Catholic priest and to a Catholic
priest only; and from his lips words
of counsel and of kindness will have
vastly more weight than when they
come from any other source whatsoever.</p>

<p>Of Mettray, in France,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> a Catholic
institution, and the model reformatory
of the world, we read,
page 258, that "the church doors
stand always open, and whoever
seeks an opportunity for private
prayer is free to enter," and, page
259, "the founders of the institution
have laid great stress on the influence
of religion as affording the only solid
foundation for the reformation of criminals;
and the words, '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maison de
Dieu</i>,' are inscribed in front of the
church as an acknowledgment that,
unless the Lord build the house, their
labor is but lost that build it. The
proportion of communicants is considerable,
and it is noticeable that on
the approach of the great festivals,
there is always a marked diminution
in the number of infractions."</p>

<p>The necessity of bringing Catholic
religious influences to bear on Catholic
prisoners has been acknowledged
in the Irish prison system, which is
considered of all prison systems the
most perfect; for we are told, page
336, that, besides the Protestant,
there are Catholic chaplains who "say
mass daily, and hold religious services
twice on Sunday."</p>

<p>In the most friendly spirit, we respectfully
recommend the consideration
of these facts and suggestions to
the Prison Association of New York,
and to all, throughout the country,
who take an interest in our prison
system and desire the reformation
and welfare of our unfortunate criminals.
They are generally the victims
of ignorance and wretchedness.
Had they been willing to exchange
faith for falsehood, and to barter
their birthright for a mess of pottage,
they might now be prosperous in
their native land. Thus is a certain
glory found even in their shame.
For the sake of principle they have
embraced poverty and exile. They
are poor; and the poor sin publicly
and are punished. Surrounded by
countless temptations, when they fall
they are more to be pitied than
blamed. We could not disown them
if we would, and we would not if we
could. The church never disowned
them. On the contrary, she has performed
miracles of mercy in their favor.
The Saviour never disowned
them, for we read that he ate with
publicans and sinners.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Much has been done toward reforming
this unfortunate class. Much
more may yet be done. Their souls
are not dead but sleeping! Let the
Prison Association of New York see
that the influences of their own religion
are brought to bear upon them.
Wherever there is a considerable number
of Catholics confined in any prison,
penitentiary, reform-school, or
school-ship, let a Catholic priest be
invited to administer to their spiritual
wants and to perform the religious service
of their church. Let the association
see that in the selection of
books for prison libraries, a fair share
are Catholic books; not dry theological
treatises, nor dull books of piety,
but books such as are calculated to
divert, to instruct, to elevate; to
make better men, better citizens, and
better members of society; to
strengthen conscience and loyalty to
the great principles of divine religion
and eternal right.</p>

<p>We entirely agree with the association
as to the end to be attained,
and we have endeavored, in a few
words, to point out the means best
calculated for the attainment of that
end with a very large part of our
criminals. We trust that our ideas
will receive a trial, and that narrow-minded
and bigoted intolerance will
not be allowed to put obstacles in
the way.</p>

<p>Catholic criminals can be permanently
reformed only by Catholic religious
influences.</p>

<h2>CATHOLICITY AND PANTHEISM.<br />

<small>NUMBER EIGHT.</small></h2>

<p class="center">UNION BETWEEN THE INFINITE AND THE FINITE, OR FIRST MOMENT OF GOD'S
EXTERNAL ACTION</p>


<p>The result of our preceding article
was a supreme duality&mdash;the infinite
and the finite. The one absolutely
distinct in nature from the other.
The first self-existing, necessary, eternal,
immutable, infinitely perfect, and
absolutely complete and blessed in his
interior life; the other, created, contingent,
mutable, imperfect, and on the
way to development. How can this
duality, so marked and so distinct,
the terms of which are so infinitely
apart, be harmonized and brought
together into unity?</p>

<p>Such is the fifth problem which
pantheism raises, and which it undertakes
to solve.</p>

<p>Let us investigate more deeply the
nature of the problem.</p>

<p>We do not now inquire whether
there be any kind of union between
the infinite and the finite, because
they are already united by means of
the creative act.</p>

<p>The infinite creates the finite, sustains
and directs it, three moments which
constitute the finite and cause it to act.
This is the first and fundamental union
between the infinite and the finite.
After what union, then, do we seek
when the problem is raised, Is there
a union between the infinite and the
finite already perfect as to being, or, in
other words, between the infinite and
the finite already united by the creative
act?</p>

<p>We inquire after a union which may
mark and express the highest possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
elevation of perfection which the cosmos,
or the assemblage of all finite
beings, may attain; and as the finite, as
we shall see, cannot acquire its highest
possible perfection except by a union
with infinite perfection, it follows that
the problem inquires after the highest
possible union between the infinite and
the finite.</p>

<p>We shall, according to our wont,
give the pantheistic solution of the
problem, and then subjoin the answer
of Catholicity. The pantheistic
solution is as follows: The infinite is
the highest possible indetermination
and indefiniteness in the way to development.
It becomes definite and
concrete in the finite, and this by a
gradual process.</p>

<p>First, it assumes the lowest possible
form of existence in the mineral kingdom.
Then it begins to show life in
the vegetable kingdom. It acquires
sensation and perception in the animal,
and shoots up into intelligence
and consciousness in humanity. Yet
is this intelligence and consciousness
essentially progressive, and begins
from the minimum degree to rise to
the highest. This principle explains
all the stages of more or less civilization
of which history makes mention.
At first the infinite acquires those faculties
in humanity which border on
and are more akin to the senses, such
as the imagination and the fancy;
hence the primitive state of nations
is marked with very imperfect development
of the reasoning faculties, and
with a superabundance of imagination;
consequently, this primitive state
abounds in national bards, who discharge
all those offices which, in nations
more civilized, are fulfilled by
others, such as historians, orators, etc.
It is also the age of myths, when
people with young and robust fancy
are apt to give flesh and blood and
personality to any striking legend in
vogue, until the legend, so dressed up
and personified, is misunderstood for
a historical fact and real person. Then,
in proportion as the development advances,
the infinite acquires a better
explication of the reasoning faculties,
and hence the ages of philosophy.
Of course the development is gradual
and slow, and is perfected by time and
continued development, until the infinite
arrives not only to the fullest
explication of the reasoning faculties,
but also to the full consciousness of
its infinity, and of its eternal duration.</p>

<p>The infinite, arrived at the fullest
explication of its intelligence, and to
the full consciousness of its infinity,
is humanity, or the cosmos arrived to
the highest possible perfection. This
humanity, dressed up by the imagination
of the people, with individuality
and personal traits, is the Christ, or
the myth which Christians adore.</p>

<p>"The subject of the attributes,"
says Strauss, "which the church predicates
of Christ, is not an individual,
but a certain idea, though real, and
not void of reality, like the Kantian
ideas. The properties and perfections
attributed to Christ by the church, if
considered as united in one individual,
the God-man, contradict each other,
but may be reconciled in the idea of
the <i>species</i>. Humanity is the collection
of two natures, or God made
man; that is, the <i>infinite spirit transformed
into a finite nature who is
conscious of his eternal duration</i>. This
humanity is begotten from a visible
mother and an invisible father, that is,
spirit and nature. It is that which
performs miracles, enjoys impeccability,
dies, and rises again, and goes
up to heaven. Man, believing in this
Christ, and especially in his death and
resurrection, may acquire justification
before God."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>According to pantheism, then, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
infinite, acquiring the full consciousness
of his infinite perfections in humanity,
is the highest possible perfection
of the cosmos, and the union,
therefore, between the two is the union
of <i>identity</i>.</p>

<p>We are dispensed from attempting
any refutation of this theory, seeing
that it rests on premises which we
have already demonstrated to be false
and absurd. We only beg the reader
to observe how utterly futile and useless
is this theory for the solution of
the problem which has called it forth.
The problem is, how to raise the cosmos
to the highest possible perfection,
or, in other words, how to establish
the highest possible union of the finite
and the infinite, from which the highest
possible perfection of the finite
may result.</p>

<p>Pantheism answers by proclaiming
the absolute identity of the infinite
and the finite, by marking the highest
possible perfection on the cosmos,
when the infinite in its finite form of
development acquires a consciousness
of its infinity. Now, it is evident in
this answer that one term of the problem
is swept away, that no real cosmos
exists, that it is but a phenomenon
of the infinite, and that, consequently,
in the pantheistic solution the problem
of the highest possible union of
the infinite and the finite cannot
exist, because the second term of the
union does not really exist.</p>

<p>In the preceding article we raised
the question, Is there a means by
which to raise the cosmos to the
highest possible perfection, a perfection
almost absolute and beyond which we
cannot go? And we answered that
the problem cannot be solved by
human reason, being altogether super-intelligible,
and that the solution of it
must be left to the Catholic Church,
the repository of divine revelation.</p>

<p>Now, the church answers the problem
by laying down the first moment
of the external action of God, the
hypostatic moment. By it the human
nature, and through it the cosmos, is
elevated to the highest possible perfection&mdash;a
perfection beyond which we
could not go; and thus the problem is
resolved, and the aspiration of the
finite to the highest possible union
with the infinite is satisfied. That the
reader may fully understand the doctrine
of Catholicity in answer to the
problem, we shall beg leave to recall
a few principles which will pave the
way to the very heart of the answer.</p>

<p>1st. Every work of God, before it
exists in itself, has an objective existence
in God's Word.</p>

<p>We remarked, in the sixth article,
that every contingent being must have
a twofold state of existence, one objective,
the other subjective. The
objective is the ideal and intelligible
state of every being residing eternally
in the mind of God. Now, all God's
ideality or intelligibility is centred in
the Word, whose constituent is to be
the very ideality or intelligibility of
God. Consequently, the cosmos, before
it exists in itself, has an objective
and intelligible state of existence in
the Word. In other terms, the Word
is the subsisting and eternal intelligible
expression of every thing that
God is, and every thing that resides
within God. He is, therefore, essentially
the expression of all divine ideas.
Now, all the works of God are a
divine idea. Therefore, the Word by
his personal constituent is the representation,
the type of the general system
of God's external works.</p>

<p>2d. All the works of God, inasmuch
as they reside in the Word in
a typical state, are infinite.</p>

<p>For whatever is within God is
identified with his essence, which is
absolute simplicity. Therefore, the
cosmos, in its typical state residing in
the Word, resides in God, and is thus
identified with the essence of God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
and is consequently infinite. St.
John, with the sublimest expression
ever uttered by man, renders this idea
when he says, "All that was made in
him (the Word) was life,"<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
indicating
that the Word, consisting of all the
intelligibility of God and that which
was made belonging to the ideality
and intelligibility of God, was the
very life of the Word, and consequently
infinite.</p>

<p>3d. The Word is not only the type
but the efficient cause of the cosmos.
The truth of this follows from the essential
relation of the Word to the
Father.</p>

<p>The Father, knowing himself, knows
also whatever is possible. But whatever
he knows he utters and expresses
by his Word. Therefore, the Father,
through his only Word, utters himself
and things outside himself. But his
utterance of creatures is also the
cause of their subjective existence,
since God is pure and undivided act.
Consequently, through his single Word
he affirms himself and his exterior
works, and consequently he is also
their efficient cause.</p>

<p>4th. The external action of God
tends to express, exteriorly, the divine
idea of the cosmos, as perfectly as it
is uttered interiorly.</p>

<p>We have shown in the preceding
article that, although it was not
necessary that God should effect the
best possible cosmos, for the reasons
which we have therein given, yet it
was most agreeable to the end of
creation that God should effect the
best possible cosmos. Now, the best
possible cosmos is evidently that
which draws as near as possible to its
intelligible and typical state. Consequently,
the external action of God
has a tendency to express, exteriorly,
the divine ideas as perfectly as he
utters them interiorly. St. Thomas
proves the same truth with a somewhat
similar argument. Every agent,
he says, intends to express his own
similitude (the interior idea) on the
effect he produces, and the more perfect
is the agent, the better and
stronger will be the similitude between
him and his effect. Now, God is
most perfect agent. It was, therefore,
most agreeable to him to stamp his
own similitude on his external works
as perfectly as possible; that is, it was
most agreeable to him to render his
external works as like their typical
state as possible.</p>

<p>5th. This supreme or best possible
expression of the typical state of
God's external works could not be
substantial or ontological.</p>

<p>We have seen that the typical
state of the cosmos, residing eternally
in the Word of God, is identified with
him, and is therefore infinite. It follows,
therefore, that if we suppose a
supreme, substantial, and ontological
expression of this typical state, we
must suppose a supreme, substantial,
and ontological expression of the infinite.
Now, this is absurd; because
a supreme and ontological expression
of the infinite would be the very substance
of God. On the other hand,
the expression, requiring necessarily
to be created, would be essentially
finite. Consequently, on the supposition,
we should have a finite infinite
substantial expression of God, which
is a contradiction in terms.</p>

<p>6th. The supreme expression cannot
be effected except by an incorporation
of the infinite into the finite.</p>

<p>Having excluded the identity between
the finite and infinite natures,
an identity which would be a necessary
consequence if the expression
were substantial and ontological, if a
supreme expression of the infinite is
to be effected, if the cosmos, in its
subjective state, is to be elevated and
made as like as possible to its typical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
state, there are no other means of
effecting this than by an incorporation
of the infinite into the finite. For let
it be remembered that the finite, in
force of its nature, is indefinitely progressive.
You can add perfection to
perfection, but unless you transform
it into the infinite, it will never change
its nature, and will continue to be
finite. Thus, the only possible way of
elevating it to the highest possible
perfection, is to raise it to a union
with the infinite greater than which
you cannot conceive.</p>

<p>7th. This union or incorporation
must be effected by the Word.</p>

<p>Because, first, the Word is the natural
organ between the Father and his
exterior work, since, with the same utterance,
the Father speaks himself and
his external works. Secondly, this
union is required in order that the
external works may draw as near to
their typical state as possible. Now,
the Word is the living and personal
typical state of the cosmos, the intelligible
life of the external works; it
is necessary, therefore, that <em>he</em> should
enter into the finite, and bring into
harmony the interior infinite type of
the cosmos, with its finite external expression;
unite together the ideal intelligible
state with the real subjective
state of the cosmos.</p>

<p>From all we have said, it follows
that all the external works reside in
the Word; that inasmuch as they reside
in the Word in their typical state,
they are his very life, and consequently
infinite; that the Word is not only
the typical but efficient cause of the
cosmos; that the external act tends
to express exteriorly the typical state
of the cosmos as perfectly as it is uttered
interiorly; that this supreme expression
could not be substantial and
ontological; and that, consequently,
the only means of effecting it was an
incorporation of the infinite into the
finite, to be executed by the Word as
the natural organ between God and
his external works.</p>

<p>Now, this is the answer which Catholicity
affords to the problem,
What is the union by which the finite
attains its highest possible perfection?</p>

<p>It answers in the sublime expressions
of the Eagle among the Evangelists,
and which resume, in a few
words, all we have hitherto said.</p>

<p>"In the beginning (the Father) was
the Word.</p>

<p>"And the Word was with God.</p>

<p>"And the Word was God. The
same was in the beginning with God.
All things were made <em>by him</em>, and
without him was made nothing.</p>

<p>"That which was made in him was
<em>life</em>.</p>

<p>"And the Word was made <em>flesh</em>, and
dwelt among us."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>The Word of God, the subsisting
ideality of the Father, the living type
of his external works, united himself
to human nature, the micro-cosmos,
or abridgment of the cosmos, in such a
close and intimate union as to be himself
the subsistence of human nature,
and thus exalted the cosmos to its
highest possible perfection. This
union of the Word with human nature
is called hypostatic or personal
union.</p>

<p>We must now study its nature and
properties, draw the consequences
which flow from it, and point out how
well it answers all the requisites and
conditions of the problem.</p>

<p>And in the first place, we remark
that the subsistence of finite beings is
also contingent and variable. We
have before given an idea of subsistence
and personality; but we beg
leave to recall a few ideas about these
most important notions of ideology,
that the reader may better perceive in
what the nature of the hypostatic
union really consists. We shall explain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the following notions: possibility,
actuality, nature, substance,
subsistence, and personality.</p>

<p>Possibility is the non-repugnance
of a being. It is intrinsic or exterior.
When the essential elements which
constitute the idea of a being do not
clash together or contradict each
other, the being is intrinsically possible.
When, besides the intrinsic possibility,
there exists a principle which
may give the being actual existence,
the possibility is external.</p>

<p>The intrinsic possibility of a being
in the mind of the cause or principle
of this being is called intelligible actuality.
Actuality or existence, properly
speaking&mdash;that is, subjective actuality&mdash;is
the existence of the being
outside of the intelligent cause which
perceives it; or, in other words, the
external expression of the intelligible
actuality.</p>

<p>Nature is the radical, interior principle
of action in every existing being.</p>

<p>Substance is the existing of the being
in itself, or the permanence and
duration of a being in itself. Now,
a being which is a substance may be
united with another substance, and
the union may be so close that one
of them may become the natural, inseparable,
intrinsic organ of the other.
In this case the being which is thus
united with the other and has become
the organ of the other, although not
ceasing to be a substance, possesses
no subsistence of its own. What,
then, is the subsistence of a being?
It is not merely the existing in itself;
it is the exclusive possession of the
existing in itself and whatever flows
from this exclusive possession. A being
is possessed of existence in itself
and of its operations, when the
union of which we have spoken does
not exist. But whenever such union
exists, though the being continues to
be substance or to exist in itself, it
has yet no exclusive possession of itself.</p>

<p>Hence, subsistence is defined the
last complement of a substance which
makes it an independent whole, separate
or distinct from all others; makes
it own and possess itself, and renders
it responsible for its operations. Personality
adds to this the element of
intelligence; so that a person is that
supreme and intelligent principle in
a being which knows itself to be a
whole, independent of all others;
which enjoys the possession of itself,
and is responsible for its actions.
Consequently, every substance which
is complete&mdash;that is, detached from
and independent of all other substances
in such a manner as to constitute
a whole by itself, and alone to bear
the attribution of its properties,
modifications, and functions&mdash;is a
subsistence.</p>

<p>The subsistence or personality of
a contingent being is also contingent,
and may be separable from it so
as to give rise to a twofold supposition,
either that the contingent
being never had a subsistence of its
own, or, if it had, it may be deprived
of it, and its own subsistence may be
substituted by another.</p>

<p>In the first place, we remark, in
vindication of this statement, that it
is impossible that any substance could
really exist without a subsistence.
Because, as we have said, subsistence
is the last complement of substance,
and consequently without it the substance
could not be actual, but would
be a mere abstraction. That for
which we contend in the proposition
just laid down is, that it is not necessary
that a substance should have
a subsistence of its own, but that it
may subsist of the subsistence of another.</p>

<p>For it is evident that every being
comprised within the sphere of the
contingent and the finite may cease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
to be a whole by itself, and may contract
with a nature foreign to itself
a union so intimate and so strong as
to depend on this foreign nature in all
its functions and its states, and no
longer to bear the attribution and
solidarity of its actions and modifications.
If, for instance, a hand detached
from the whole body were to
trace characters, this action would be
attributed to it exclusively; it would
be a subsistence, a whole by itself,
and we should say, <em>That hand writes</em>.
But if it should become a part of,
and we should consider is as dependent
on, a human nature and will, it
would then lose the solidary attribution
of the function of which it is the
organ; and then we could no longer
say, <em>That hand writes</em>; but, <em>That man
writes</em>.</p>

<p>A contingent substance may be deprived
of the possession of its subsistence
by a union with a substance
even inferior in nature to itself. Because
its superiority over this nature
would not prevent its being dependent
on it in its functions and in its
states, as is the case with the human
soul, which presides over the body,
which produces in it continual changes,
and which, in spite of the excellence
which distinguishes it from the
mass of matter which it animates, yet
depends on the body in its most intimate
situations, and finds itself bowed
down by the continual evil which
it suffers thereby.</p>

<p>Hence is it that in man the possession
of subsistence belongs neither to
the soul nor to the body, and there is
no other subsistence in him but the
sum of the two natures of which he
is composed, but the whole of the
two extremes united together, and
which is at the same time spirit and
body, incorruptible and corruptible,
the intelligent and the brute.</p>

<p>Hence, neither the soul nor the
body are denominated separately by
their respective functions; but it is
the whole man who receives the attribution
and the different appellations
of the actions and states of either nature,
and we say, man thinks, man
walks, man wills, man grows. Consequently
that axiom, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Actiones et denominationes
sunt suppositorum</i>, Actions
are to be attributed to the subsistence.
We remark, in the second
place, that in the infinite alone the
subsistence and personality is necessary,
and consequently can never be
separated from him or be dependent
on any other. Because in this order
personality affects a nature essentially
complete, total, and of its own intrinsic
nature absolutely independent in
its action and in its eternal and
immutable state, of all external substance.</p>

<p>It follows, therefore, that if a divine
personality enters into a finite nature, it
must necessarily preserve its own subsistence,
since it is evident that, if a
divine person is united to a created
nature in a manner so close and intimate
as to form one single individuality,
the created nature, in force of
the principles above stated, would
have no individuality of its own, and
the divine personality would, in such
case, necessarily be the supreme
and independent principle constituting
the new individual, the infinite
term and completion of the two natures.
Now, such is the hypostatic
union. The infinite person of the
Word united to himself human nature
in a manner so close and intimate
as to form one single individuality,
Christ Jesus, the Theanthropos; so
that the human nature of Christ had
no subsistence of its own, but subsisted
of the personality of the Word.
Hence, in Christ the Word of God
was the only supreme and independent
principle, who knew himself to be a
whole apart, composed of the human
and divine natures, who bore alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the attribution and solidarity of the
actions springing from either nature,
and who was, consequently, the only
person in Christ.</p>

<p>But to make the nature of the hypostatic
union more intelligible to the
reader, we shall dwell upon it a little
longer.</p>

<p>We may reduce all the unions between
the infinite and the finite to
three. The first is the action of God
creating finite substances, maintaining
them in existence and directing all
their movements, permitting, however,
their defects and shortcomings.</p>

<p>This is the first and fundamental
union between the infinite and the
finite. It begins the moment the
finite is created, and continues in existence
by preservation and concurrence.
All this in the natural order.
In the supernatural order there is also
a first and fundamental union, as we
shall see, by which the action of
God effects, as it were, a new and superior
term, preserves and directs it
in its development. Thus, the first
union between the finite and the infinite
is the action of God effecting a
finite term, maintaining it in existence
and directing it in its development,
both in the substantial and in
the sublimative moments. However,
this union not only leaves whole and
entire the individuality and subsistence
of the two terms united, but is
not even so close and intimate as to
prevent the finite term of the union
from occasionally failing in its action,
and of falling short of the aim to
which it naturally tends. Hence a
second and more excellent species
of union. By it the infinite is so
closely united with the finite as not
only to preserve it, and to direct it in
all its actions, but also to prevent
it from falling into defects and errors.</p>

<p>This second kind of union, though,
as it is evident, far exceeding the
former in intimacy and perfection,
since it implies an extraordinary employment
of activity on the part of
the infinite, and a special elevation
of the finite, is yet not so close as to
deprive the finite term of its own
subsistence and individuality.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
We
may, therefore, conceive a third kind
of union, whereby an infinite personality
may be united to a finite nature
so closely and so intimately as not
only to move and direct it in all its
actions, as not only to prevent it
from falling into failings and imperfections,
but as to make it the <i>intrinsic
instrument</i>, the <i>intimate organ</i> of
his own infinite action in such a
manner as to form of the finite nature
and of the infinite personality a new
and single individuality.</p>

<p>This supposition is eminently possible.
For, on the one hand, the infinite
personality being possessed of
infinite energy, and, on the other, the
finite nature being endowed with an
indefinite capacity of sublimation,
nothing can detain the first from
communicating itself to the second
with such energy, power, and intensity
of communication as to render it
its own most intimate and dependent
organ of action. In fact, let the
communication of an infinite person
to a finite nature be carried to its
highest possible degree of union
short of absorbing and destroying
the real existence of the finite, its
substantiality, so to speak; let this
finite nature be, accordingly, raised
to the highest possible intimacy with
the infinite person; let the latter take
such intense possession of the former
as to make it its own intrinsic organ,
the immediate and sole instrument of
his own infinite operation, and what
will the result be? Why, that the
finite nature will no longer possess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
itself, no longer form a whole by
itself separated from and independent
of any other; no longer bear the attribution
of the actions springing
from its nature; in short, it will no
longer be a subsistence and an individuality
by itself, but will form one
single individuality with the divine
person, or rather the infinite person
will be the only single subsistence of
the two natures united, the infinite
and the finite. The finite nature in
this supposition would stand, with
regard to the infinite person, in the
same relation in which our body
stands with regard to our soul. For
the union of body and soul, which
constitutes the individual called man,
takes place according to this kind of
union. The soul is united to the
body in a manner so close and so intimate
as to render the body its own
most intrinsic, dependent instrument,
the organ of its operations in such a
manner that, in force of this operation,
the body does not possess itself,
does not form a whole apart, nor is
it accountable for the actions which
immediately flow from its nature.
In other words, it has no subsistence
of its own, but subsists of the subsistence
of the soul and the whole individual
man. The result of this
union is possessed of the subsistence
and forms one person.</p>

<p>The Incarnation of the Word is
like to this union, hence called hypostatic
or personal union. The second
person of the Trinity united
himself to the entire human nature,
constituted of body and soul, in a
manner so close and intimate as to
be <em>himself</em> the subsistence of the human
nature; the latter never enjoying
a subsistence of its own, because,
contemporaneously to the very first
instant of its existence, it became the
internal, the immediate, and the most
intimate organ of the Word of God,
and subsisted of the subsistence of
the Word, so that it never bore the
attribution and solidarity of those actions
which have an immediate origin
in human nature, but the attribution
and solidarity, and, consequently,
the moral worth, of those actions
belonged to the personality of the
Word, according to the axiom that
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Actiones sunt suppositorum</i>.</p>

<p>Hence the union between the
Word of God and his human nature
was not a moral union, which always
implies the distinct individuality and
personality of the two terms united,
as Nestorius thought, and many
would-be Christians of the present
day seem to hold.</p>

<p>Nestorius was ready to grant that
the union between the Word and human
nature was as high and intimate
as possible, so far as moral union can
permit; but never would he concede
that it was any higher than simple
moral union, which kept whole and
entire the two individualities united.
Consequently, he admitted two persons
and two individualities in Christ&mdash;the
<em>Word</em> of God, and the man
called Christ. From which theory it
follows that our Lord was a mere
man&mdash;a saint, if you will, the highest
of all saints, yet simply a man.</p>

<p>Catholic doctrine, on the contrary,
teaching that the union of the Word
and the human nature was personal,
inasmuch as the divine person of the
Word was the subsistence in which
his human nature subsisted, teaches
consequently, at the same time, that in
Christ there is one person, one individuality&mdash;the
divine personality of the
Word; that therefore Christ, the new
individual, is God, being the second
divine person, in which both his divine
and human nature subsist. Nor
was the human nature of this new individual
so absorbed by the divine personality
as to cease to be a substance,
as Eutyches affirmed, who
upheld, it would seem, a fusion and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
mixture of the two natures altogether
inconceivable and absurd.</p>

<p>From all we have said we may
form quite an accurate idea of what
the hypostatic union really means.
It is the union, or the meeting, so to
speak, of the human and divine natures
in the one single point of contact,
the infinite personality of the
Word of God; the human nature
having no personality of its own, but
subsisting of the identical personality
of the Word.</p>

<p>The new individual possessed of
the divine and human nature in the
unity of the single personality of the
Word is Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>To complete now the idea of the
hypostatic union, we shall point out
some consequences which evidently
flow from that union:</p>

<p>1. We should consider that nature
being transmitted through generation,
and Christ being possessed of two
natures, the human and the divine, it
is necessary to admit in him a twofold
generation: one eternal, according
to which he received the divine
nature from the Father; the second
temporal, by which he received his
human nature from the Virgin Mother.</p>

<p>2. As nature is the radical principle
and source of operation in every
being, it follows that, as Christ is possessed
of two natures, we must predicate
of him a double operation&mdash;one
human, the other divine.</p>

<p>3. In force of the same principle,
we must predicate of him whatever
necessarily belongs to the two distinct
natures. Hence, as intelligence
and will, together with their respective
perfections, belong both to the
human and to the divine nature, it is
clear that we must attribute to Christ,
first, a divine intelligence and a divine
will with their perfections, such
as infinite wisdom and knowledge,
infinite holiness, goodness, justice,
etc.; second, a human intelligence
and a human will, together with the
perfections of these faculties, as
knowledge, wisdom, holiness, etc.</p>

<p>4. As actions, though immediately
proceeding from nature, are to be attributed
to the subsistence and personality,
because nature could not
act without being possessed of subsistence,
and as the subsistence and
personality of both natures of Christ
is one&mdash;the personality of the Word
of God; and as this personality is infinite,
it follows that the actions of
Christ, whether immediately springing
from his human nature, or proceeding
from his divine nature, have
all an infinite worth and excellence,
on the ground of the infinite worth
of the person to whom they must be
attributed. This principle, so evident,
and grounded on the axiom of
ideology to which we have alluded&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Actiones
sunt suppositorum</i>&mdash;has been
denied by some, especially Unitarians.
But happily the most abstract
principles of ideology have such a
bearing upon human dignity that it
is easy to refute such would-be philosophers
on the strong ground of the
dignity of the human species. Let
us give an instance. How are the
actions immediately proceeding from
the corporal nature of man, such, for
instance, as those of locomotion, distinguished
from the actions of locomotion
in the brutes? And why is it
that the actions of locomotion of the
first may attain the highest and most
heroic moral worth, while the same
actions in the brute may never have
a moral dignity? Ontologically
they are the same. An animal may
move its foot; I may do the same;
both movements may save the life
of a man. In me, the stirring of my
foot may have the dignity of a moral
and heroic action. In the brute, it
can never have it. What causes the
difference? The difference lies in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the fact that I am a person, the brute
is not. I, being a person, the supreme,
first, and independent principle
of action of both my natures,
corporal and spiritual, it follows that
all actions radically flowing from
either of my natures are to be attributed
to me as person, as the supreme
and independent principle of
them; and as I, as a person, am capable
of moral dignity, all the actions,
whether proceeding from my corporal
or my spiritual nature, become
capable of moral worth and dignity.</p>

<p>In Christ, the personality or the
supreme and independent principle
of action of both his natures, human
and divine, being one, it is evident
that whether his actions radically
proceed from his human nature, or
spring from his divine nature, they
must all be attributed to his one and
single person; and as the person is
infinite, the worth and dignity of all
his actions is simply infinite. As in
man the personality of both corporal
and spiritual natures being capable
of morality, the action springing from
either nature may have a moral dignity
and worth. We shall conclude
this article by answering a few objections
raised by Unitarians against the
hypostatic union. We shall take
them verbatim from Dr. Channing's
lecture on <i>Unitarian Christianity</i>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"According to this doctrine, (the doctrine
of those who hold the hypostatic
union,) Jesus Christ, instead of being one
mind, one conscious intelligent principle,
whom we can understand, consists of two
souls, two minds: the one divine, the other
human; the one weak, the other almighty;
the one ignorant, the other omniscient. Now,
we maintain that this is to make Christ two
beings. To denominate him one person,
one being, and yet to suppose him made up
of two minds infinitely different from each
other, is to abuse and confound language,
and to throw darkness over all our conceptions
of intelligent natures. According to
the common doctrine, each of those two
minds in Christ has its own consciousness,
its own will, its own perceptions. They
have, in fact, no common properties. The
divine mind feels none of the wants and
sorrows of the human, and the human is infinitely
removed from the perfections and
happiness of the divine. Can you conceive
of two beings in the universe more
distinct? We have always thought that
one person was constituted and distinguished
by one consciousness. The doctrine
that one and the same person should have
two consciousnesses, two wills, two souls
infinitely different from each other, this we
think an enormous tax on human credulity."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We are not, of course, aware from
what source or teachers Dr. Channing
learned the doctrine of the hypostatic
union. Of one thing we are
fully assured, that the Catholic
Church never taught, first, that in
Christ there are two souls. He is
endowed with a human soul, belonging
to the human nature of which he
is possessed. The infinite and divine
nature of the Word, of which Christ
is also preserved, has never, in theological
language, been called a soul,
nor can we denominate it by that
name except in loose and metaphorical
language, unworthy of a philosopher
and theologian who is stating
points of doctrine.</p>

<p>Again, the Catholic Church never
taught that the human soul of Christ
was ignorant. This may have been
the opinion of those from whom Dr.
Channing may have drawn the theory
of the hypostatic union; but in stating
a doctrine in which all Christendom
concurs, Protestant as well as
Catholic, we should have thought it
more honest if Dr. Channing, not
satisfied with his own teachers, would
have taken the pains to ascertain
what two hundred and fifty millions
of Christians hold about it.</p>

<p>The first real objection of Dr.
Channing is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We maintain that this (to attribute to
Christ two natures in one person) is to
make Christ two beings."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>
<p>The same looseness and want of
accuracy of philosophical language.
What does Dr. Channing mean by
<em>being</em>? If by being is meant nature,
of course we do all attribute to Christ
two natures, the human and the divine.</p>

<p>If by being is meant person, we
deny flatly that to attribute to Christ
two natures is to make him two persons.</p>

<p>Let the reverend doctor prove the
intrinsic impossibility of two distinct
natures being united in one single subsistence
and person, and then we shall
grant him that Christ, being possessed
of two natures, is two persons also.
But such impossibility can never be demonstrated;
for the fact of the union
between soul and body in man, in
the unity of one single personality,
is a contradiction to all such pretended
impossibility. We have, moreover,
shown in the course of this article the
intrinsic possibility of such supposition.</p>

<p>Dr. Channing continues:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"To denominate him one person, one
being, and yet to suppose him made up of
two minds infinitely different from each
other, is to abuse and confound language,
and to throw darkness over all our conceptions
of intelligent natures."</p></blockquote>

<p>If our reverend opponent chooses
to look with contempt and slight on all
distinct and accurate notions of ideology,
which he calls, in another place,
vain philosophy; if he prefers to form
crude and undigested ideas; if he will
not sound to the very depth the nature,
the faculties of intelligent beings,
their acts, the genesis of their acts,
their distinctions from other faculties
and their acts; but loves rather to argue
from ideas common to men who
have never thought and thought
deeply on these subjects, and distinguished
them carefully, and classified
them, is it any fault of ours if, when
we propound the true philosophical
doctrines about these subjects, Dr.
Channing's ideas should become confused,
and that darkness should spread
over that which was never clear?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"According to the common doctrine, each
of these two minds in Christ has its own
consciousness, its own will, its own perceptions.
They have, in fact, no common
properties. Can you conceive of two beings
in the universe more distinct?"</p></blockquote>

<p>If by being the doctor meant natures,
we cannot conceive any thing in
the universe more distinct, for which
reason Catholicity teaches that there
are two <em>distinct</em> natures in Christ.</p>

<p>If by being the doctor means that
those two natures must make two
persons, we cannot grant the assertion,
and ask again for proofs.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We have always thought that one person
was constituted and distinguished by
one consciousness."</p></blockquote>

<p>This is the only show of reason we
can find in the whole passage we
have been refuting; and we have no
hesitation in affirming that, if our opponent
thought that one person is
constituted by one consciousness, in
the sense that when an intelligent nature
is endowed with consciousness it
must necessarily possess a personality
of its own, so that consciousness and
personality may be said to be identical,
as the doctor supposes, he was
wrong in thinking so, and should study
more deeply into the distinctive
essence of consciousness and personality.
We may make the following
suppositions, according to true ideology:</p>

<p>1st. An intelligent nature, having
consciousness of itself, may have a
personality of its own, as is the common
case in human nature.</p>

<p>2d. An intelligent nature, having
the consciousness of itself, may be
deprived of its own personality and
subsist of the personality of another,
simply because consciousness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
personality are two distinct things,
and may either go together or be
separated, without one being affected
by the other.</p>

<p>Personality is the last complement
of an intelligent nature, by which it
forms a whole apart from all others,
possessing itself, and being solidary
of its actions.</p>

<p>Consciousness, or the <em>me</em>, is nothing
more than the notion of an intelligent
activity which perceives the
identity of itself, thinking and reasoning
with the act which perceives such
identity. It rises in man in that first
moment on which he becomes aware
that the act which perceives the reasoning
activity is not something different
from itself, but something identical
with the reasoning activity. In
that first instant in which he perceives
himself, man may pronounce, I.</p>

<p>He that says I, in uttering that
monosyllable testifies of being conscious
that there is an activity, that
this activity is the same which reflects,
speaks, and announces itself, perceiving
this activity.</p>

<p>Now, it is evident that the two
notions of personality and consciousness
are absolutely distinct, and as
such they may be separated; and
that the one can exist without the
other in the sense already explained.
Consequently, supposing an individual
composed of two natures, one divine,
the other human, both brought
together in the unity of one divine
person, it follows that the divine nature
has consciousness of itself; in
other words, is conscious that there is
an infinite activity which perceives itself,
and is conscious of the identity
between the activity and the perception
of that activity. It follows, in the
second place, that the human mind of
the human nature has also a consciousness
of itself; that is, that in itself there
is a finite activity, and that activity perceives
itself, and is conscious of the
identity between the activity and the
act of perception.</p>

<p>The divine nature in this one divine
person would be conscious of
being that supreme and independent
principle of action of the natures;
whereas the human nature would not
be conscious of being such a supreme
and independent principle of action,
but dependent and subject.</p>

<h2>THE SEVEN BISHOPS.</h2>


<p>We found, in a leading daily paper
of New York the other day, an editorial
remark which illustrates so well
the propensity of Protestant journalists
toward inconsistency whenever
they deal with the relations between
civil government and the Catholic
Church, that we here cite it in full:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Spain," said <cite>The Tribune</cite>, "is going to
have a trial of the seven bishops. There
will be some difference, however, between
the question at issue in the Spanish trial
and that in the famous English cause which
Macaulay describes as the most important
recorded in the history of England. In the
Spanish case, the cause of freedom will be
represented rather by the government, who
prosecutes seven bishops for resistance of
the secular authority, than by the prelates
who are to be placed on their defence. It
seems to us a good omen when they venture
to put bishops on trial for any thing in
Spain."</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, <cite>The Tribune</cite> has always been
a foremost advocate for complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
separation of church and state.
When the new government of Spain
decreed freedom of religious worship,
<cite>The Tribune</cite>, in common with other
American journals, hailed the measure
with delight, as a great step toward
the mutual independence of the
two orders. But here, in this Spanish
affair, there is a more absolute
and oppressive assertion of their
union than even Henry VIII. ever
ventured upon in the creation of the
Anglican establishment. Only, since
the union is effected by a tyrannical
assertion of the supremacy of the
secular over ecclesiastical authority,
Protestant writers see in it an evidence
of progress and liberality. It
makes so much difference whether it
is my bull that is gored, or your ox.</p>

<p>The parallel, however, between the
seven bishops under James II., and
the seven bishops under Serrano,
(their number has been increased to
ten since that paragraph was written,
and before our readers see these
pages may be raised still higher,) is
such a fortunate one that we purpose
looking at it a little more closely. It
will be found, we think, to tell strongly
for our side, and to teach some lessons
which the Spanish regency can
ill afford to disregard.</p>

<p>In 1687, King James II. published
his celebrated Declaration of Indulgence,
by which, after expressing his
conviction that consciences could
not be forced, and religious persecution
always failed of its object, he
proceeded to suspend the execution
of all penal laws against the Catholics
and Dissenters alike, to authorize
all religious bodies to hold public
worship after their own fashion, and
to dispense with all religious tests as
qualifications for any civil or military
office. Whatever may be said of the
constitutionality of this declaration,
it was unquestionably in accordance
with the principles of freedom and
justice which have since been recognized
completely in this country, and
are gradually becoming established
in Great Britain and all other constitutional
states. The Declaration of
Indulgence might to-day be accepted
in every particular as the platform
of the English liberals or <cite>The New
York Tribune</cite>. The Protestant party
in James's day, however, was any
thing but the party of religious freedom
or liberal ideas. Church and
state, in their minds, must be one&mdash;and
that one the Protestant church.
The declaration was violently resisted.
A year later (April 27th, 1688,)
James issued a second declaration,
repeating the points of the former
one, and proclaiming his unalterable
resolution to carry it into effect. By
an order in council he subsequently
commanded that this paper should
be read on two successive Sundays at
the time of divine service by the officiating
ministers of all the churches
and chapels of the kingdom. "The
clergy of the Established Church," says
Macaulay, "with scarcely an exception,
regarded the indulgence as a violation
of the laws of the realm, as a
breach of the plighted faith of the
king, and as a fatal blow levelled at
the interest and dignity of their own
profession." The order was generally
disobeyed. The Archbishop of
Canterbury and six of his suffragans
presented a petition to the king, recounting
their objections to the declaration
and their reasons for refusing
to order its publication in
church. For this they were committed
to the tower, and tried before the
court of king's bench on a charge
of seditious libel. In the midst of
the most intense popular excitement
they were acquitted, and that day,
the 30th of June, 1688, is often referred
to as the crisis of the English
revolution. So far as it was a political
movement, this affair of the bishops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
represents a victory of the people
over the arbitrary authority of the
crown. So far as it was a religious
movement, it represents a triumph of
the secular power over what are called
the great Protestant principles of liberty
of conscience and freedom of worship.
Though the bishops may have
been political martyrs, they stand
nevertheless as the representatives
of religious intolerance, proscription,
and persecution.</p>

<p>And what is the case of the bishops
in Spain? Since the overthrow
of Isabella, the country has been in
a state little better than anarchy.
The regency of Serrano, though it
probably commands the adhesion of
a majority of the people, has never
been generally acquiesced in. Republicans,
Carlists, Isabellistas are
strong enough to cause the regency
grave apprehension, and are only
kept down by military power. The
Carlists especially display a vitality
which proves them to possess a strong
hold of some kind upon the country,
and to be much more than the little
band of miserable conspirators which
Madrid despatches represent them. It
is difficult to know the truth about
them; for we get little news from
Spain, except such as filters through
the offices of the regency at Madrid.
It is said, however, that the clergy in
general are favorable to the Carlists,
which, considering the manner in
which the churches and convents
have been plundered by the existing
authorities at the capital, is not at all
unlikely. To put the clergy entirely
at the mercy of the civil power, the
regent issued, on the 5th of August,
the following extraordinary decree:</p>

<p class="center">"DECREE.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"At the proposal of the minister of grace
and justice, and with the approbation of the
council of ministers, I ordain as follows:</p>

<p>"Article 1st. That an exhortation shall be
made, and I hereby make it to the most
reverend archbishops and the right reverend
bishops to send immediately to the government,
as is their bounden duty, a circumstantial
account of all those ecclesiastics of
their respective dioceses who have abandoned
the churches to which they were appointed,
in order to combat the political
situation established by the Constitutional
Cortes.</p>

<p>"Article 2d. The most reverend archbishops
and right reverend bishops are charged
to send to the government, immediately after
their acquaintance with this decree, and without
delays or excuses being listened to, a statement
of the canonical and public measures
they may have adopted, during the separation
and abandonment of the rebel priests,
with a view not only to correct and restrain
them, but also to repair the most grievous
scandal produced among the faithful by
such disloyal and reckless conduct; and
the government reserves to itself, after examining
the reports which the prelates may
transmit to the ministry of grace and justice,
the adoption of such other measures as it
may consider expedient.</p>

<p>"Article 3d. It being notorious that many
ecclesiastics excite the innocent minds of
some people against the laws and decisions
voted by the Cortes, and also against the
order which I have issued for their fulfilment,
let the most reverend archbishops, right
reverend bishops, and ecclesiastical administrators
send round their dioceses for
circulation, within the precise term of eight
days, a short pastoral edict, exhorting their
flocks to obedience to the constituted authorities;
and the said prelates shall, without
loss of time, transmit a copy of the said
edict to the secretary of the said ministry.</p>

<p>"<i>Article 4th. The most reverend archbishops
and the right reverend bishops are likewise charged
to withdraw the faculties of confessing and
preaching from those priests who are notoriously
displeased with, who have not hesitated to
make an ostensible display of opposition to the
constitutional regimen.</i></p>

<p>"Article 5th. The government will render
account of this decree to the Cortes.</p>

<p class="signature">
"<span class="smcap">Francisco Serrano.</span><br />
<br />
"<span class="smcap">Manuel Ruiz Zorrilla</span>,<br />
"<i>Minister of Grace and Justice</i>."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>It is difficult to imagine a bolder
usurpation of authority. If priests
are found guilty of political offences,
the regent has the <em>power</em> (we do not
speak of the right) to proceed against
them just as he would against lay citizens.
Not satisfied with that, he wishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
to impose ecclesiastical penalties
also for political heterodoxy, to constitute
himself the hierarchical superior
of all the bishops and archbishops in
Spain, to dictate the terms of their pastoral
addresses, and to make the church a
mere instrument of oppression in the
hands of the civil power. He orders
the prelates to turn informers. He
instructs them to lay punishments
upon the parochial clergy in plain
violation of canon law. Worse than
all, in the 4th article of his decree,
he commands the bishops to take
away the faculties of hearing confessions
and preaching from all priests
who are even "displeased with the
constitutional regimen." Comment
upon such an order is entirely superfluous.
If it were obeyed, probably
three fourths of the parishes in Spain
would be without pastors. As a
matter of course, the bishops have
tacitly refused to comply with this
decree, and Serrano threatens to proceed
against the most obnoxious of
them for disobedience.</p>

<p>Now, let any impartial person compare
the cases of the English and the
Spanish bishops, and tell us which represents
the more perfectly the cause
of just government and enlightened
principles. Both refused obedience
to an order of the chief civil authority
of the realm because they held it
to be an unwarrantable intrusion
upon the dignity and independence
of their order, and a violation of the
laws. Herein the cases are parallel.
The difference between them is just
this, that the order of James, though
it was unconstitutional, was a good
and liberal measure in itself, while
the order of Serrano is not only illegal
but tyrannous. How can <cite>The Tribune</cite>
say that "in the Spanish case, the
cause of freedom will be represented
rather by the government who prosecutes
seven bishops for resistance of
the secular authority, than by the
prelates who are to be placed on
their defence"? To our view, Serrano
appears as the champion of civil
and ecclesiastical despotism, and the
bishops are martyrs in the cause of
political freedom and religious independence.</p>

<p>James II. calculated that the power
of the throne would be sufficient
in any case to insure the conviction
of his seven bishops; but the prosecution
failed; the dissenting sects, which
would have benefited from his indulgence
equally with the Catholics,
united with the Anglican Church to
withstand him; the people fell on
their knees before the bishops in the
streets; and in six months the king
was a fugitive. Will Spain pursue
the parallel to this point? No government
can afford to be unjust. No
government, especially which bases
its authority upon the consent of the
people can last long after it has become
arbitrary and oppressive. Men
love equity instinctively, and the decree
of the Spanish regent will be
worth more to the Carlists than an
army of soldiers.</p>

<p>In his latest historical work, (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Isabelle
de Castille. Grandeur et Décadence de
l'Espagne</i>,) the distinguished historian,
M. Capefigue, says that, besides other
debts to Isabella of Castile, Spaniards
also owe an association that saved
Spain from disorder and anarchy&mdash;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">La
Santa Hermandad</i>, the holy brotherhood,
whose law was that of absolute
solidarity. Cervantes, in <i>Don Quixote</i>,
never lets an occasion pass of praising
the brotherhood, with which Isabella
also introduced the holy office&mdash;the Inquisition.
It is our habit, says M. Capefigue,
in matters historical, to avoid the
adoption of ready-made opinions, and
more especially declamations. We must
examine with judgment the customs, the
institutions, of a period&mdash;the necessities
of an epoch. Then, frequently, every
thing is justified and explained. Power
is not inflexible through pleasure or
caprice, but through necessity. Ogres
only exist in fairy tales. In political
history there are no men who from mere
caprice eat human flesh. There are
two periods in the history of the Inquisition.
In the first, it rendered immense
services. Ferdinand and Isabella
had just delivered Spain. But
the Moors still covered the land, and
had to be watched. In constant communication
with the Arabs in Africa,
they ceased not to invoke the aid of
their brethren across the strait. Together
they conspired to reconquer
Andalusia, the promised land of the
Arabs, who never ceased longing for the
lovely countries watered by the Guadalquivir.
Theirs it was to hope and to
plot. Spain's it was to detect and punish
them. In times of peril for a state,
exceptional powers are given, extraordinary
tribunals created. At a period
exclusively religious, the sign of Spanish
nationality was Catholicity. Christian
was the synonym of citizen, and
the holy office was charged with the
police of the state against those who accepted
not the law of the land. Not
only France but other countries have
had their committees of public safety
and their revolutionary tribunals.
In the second period, the Inquisition&mdash;no
longer useful to the state&mdash;became
a tribunal of theology. It pursued
heresy, which in societies based
on religious principles is always a danger.
Most remarkable is it that even
in its decline the Inquisition preserved
its popularity so largely among the
great men of Spain. Lope de Vega was
the chief of familiars of the holy office.
Calderon was one of its most ardent
members, bearing its banners at <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">autos da
fe</i>. Velasquez gloried in the title. Murillo
paints the flowers&mdash;the saints that
ornament the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">san benito</i>&mdash;and Zurbaran
takes his grandest heads from the Dominican
fathers of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">santa fide</i>.
Without the guard and protection of
the Inquisition, Spain would not have
effected the great things in her history.
Torn by interior dissensions, she would
not have had the Americas; the reign
of Charles V. would not have been so
glorious, nor would she have gained
the battle of Lepanto and saved Christian
Europe.</p>

<p>Late French papers announce the
death of the Baron de Croze, formerly
deputy from the department of Charente
Inférieure, father-in-law of Count Anatole
Lemercier, and for some years Cameriere
of his holiness Pius IX. The
holy father was much attached to Baron
de Croze, and frequently held with
him long and familiar conversations on
politics and history. Some ten years
ago, the Baron addressed a memorial
to Pius IX., strongly urging his holiness
to restore the Coliseum and to appeal
to the entire world for the immense
sums necessary for so great a work as
the restoration of the noblest monument
of the antique grandeur of the
Romans. "My dear son," replied Pius
IX., "I have seen your memorial, and
thank you for it; but do you not know
that there are two kinds of vandalism, the
one of destruction, the other of restoration?
Never has the Coliseum been
more beautiful than in the moving contrast
of the splendor of its past and the
magnificence of its ruins. To restore
them would, it seems to me, be an artistic
sacrilege, and would annihilate the
work of ages only to produce a poor
and colorless counterfeit. Think no
more of it, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">caro mio</i>." And the baron
thought no more of it.</p>

<p>In a late German bibliographical catalogue
we remark the name of a saint
we now see for the first time, and concerning
whom we acknowledge ourselves
utterly ignorant. It occurs in
the title of a work thus announced:
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Sainct Velociped. Eine Moderne Reiselegende</i>&mdash;Saint
Velocipede. A Legend
of Modern Travel.</p>

<p><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saint Agobard, Archevêque de Lyon,
sa Vie et ses Ecrits</i>, par M. l'Abbé P.
Chevallard, is the title of a handsome
octavo volume just published at Lyons.
Saint Agobard's life covered the period
from 779 to 840, and, with his writings,
forms an important page of the history
of the church in France during the
ninth century. His episcopal career
was active, and his influence on the religious
questions and discipline of his
time considerable. The history of this
holy man is necessarily attached to
that of the reign of Louis le Débonnaire.
St. Agobard's reputation for talent
and learning has never been contested,
and historians and critics unite
in the opinion that he was the first
mind of his period in France. It is not
exclusively within the church, nor by
Catholics alone, that St. Agobard is
thus highly appreciated. MM. Guizot
and Ampère have spoken with great
admiration of him; Ampère particularly
mentions his intelligent efforts in combating
a widely spread and deeply
rooted belief that a disastrous epidemic
which carried off thousands of cattle
was caused by the emissaries of the
Duke of Benevento, who&mdash;said popular
report&mdash;scattered powders over the
fields and in the fountains, thus producing
sudden death of the animals.
Something similar is recounted by
Manzoni in his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Promessi Sposi</i>, where
he describes the <i>Untori</i> and the pretended
cholera poisoners. Besides the
essays of St. Agobard on theology,
liturgy, and ecclesiastical discipline, his
writings on the superstitions of his
period, and on the pernicious influence
of the Jews in Lyons, are remarkable
and of high value in an historical point
of view.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Much indignation has been expressed
in several European and English
papers concerning an imaginary prohibition
of the pope to the physicians of
Rome from attending any person who,
after three days' medical attendance,
should refuse the sacraments. The
paragraphs containing the indignation
have been widely copied in the United
States, and we therefore notice the silly
statement. The existence and validity
of an old brief of Sixtus V. is probably
the origin of the singular blunder. The
brief in question orders doctors, under
pain of excommunication, to warn the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
parish priest of the patient's danger, if,
after three days, he appears in peril of
life; but beyond that the doctor cannot
act, and continues his attendance to the
last, irrespective of the patient's religious
state or dispositions. And
the provision is evidently wise and
humane. In very many cases it is
dangerous for the patient to know that
his physician considers him in peril of
death. To advise his family is much
the same as to tell the patient; and the
obvious prudence of the matter is to
notify the parish priest, who can act according
to the necessities of the case.
So much for one of the many falsehoods
of the day. Like many others, it
has travelled fast and far. Will this refutation
overtake it? Doubtful.</p>

<p>A new history of Pope Pius IX. is

<p>The distinguished Father Theiner, of
Rome, has lately given his friends occasion
to regret that he had not remained
known to the literary world by his
<i>Monumenta</i> alone. No words but those
of praise and admiration could then
have been found for him. Our occasion
for this remark is his late controversy&mdash;or
series of controversies&mdash;with
M. Crétineau-Joly, concerning
the Cardinals Consalvi and Caprara,
and Bishop Bernier, touching their
connection with the concordat of 1801.
The matter has culminated in an octavo
volume lately out, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bonaparte, le
Concordat de 1801 et le Cardinal Consalvi,
suivi des deux Lettres au Père
Theiner sur le Pape Clement XIV.</i>, par
J. Crétineau-Joly; and of which we made
mention in our August number. M.
Crétineau-Joly is a terrible adversary,
and wields a trenchant blade. Such
a rapid shower of cut, thrust, back, forward,
and circular strokes is rarely seen.
It is to be regretted, however, that M.
Joly, in the abundance of his power of
replication and retort, should not have
been content with telling Father Theiner,
as he does, "You have been given
a bad cause to sustain, and you defend
it with bad arguments." But blood becomes
as hot in literary quarrels as in
physical combats, and M. Joly goes entirely
too far when he talks about surprising
his adversary, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vingt fois, trente
fois, en flagrant débit de mensonge</i>."
Those who know Father Theiner are
satisfied that he is in this case the victim
of his imagination and of his simplicity,
and that, moreover, he has been
badly advised.</p>

<p>Dr. F. W. Kampschulte, Professor of
History at the University of Bonn, has
hitherto been known as an author
only by a few works of secondary importance,
such as his <i>History of the
Ancient University of Erfurt</i>. He
has, however, just taken rank quite suddenly
among the best historians of Germany
by his lately published <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Johann
Calvin, seine Kirche und sein Staat
in Genf</i>, (John Calvin, his Church and
his State at Geneva.) The first volume
alone is as yet published. But this one
is quite enough to display remarkable
erudition, and an amount of literary labor
nothing less than enormous. Dr.
Kampschulte asserts on good grounds
that, without the assistance of Berne,
Genevan Protestantism would never
have succeeded as it did, and he has,
accordingly, thoroughly and successfully
searched the archives of Berne for
new and valuable documents. Finally,
the author has not, like too many of
his predecessors in the same field, been
content to take for Calvin's correspondence
Beza's edition of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Epistolæ
et Responsa Calvini</i>, which really contains
but a small portion of Calvin's
correspondence, but has with wonderful
labor and perseverance collected a large
amount of Calvin's letters hitherto unknown,
and which were dispersed
throughout Europe.</p>

<p>A second edition of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bibliotheque

announced as soon to be published.
It will be in three volumes in folio,
each volume to contain about three
thousand columns, and will be placed at
the very low price of forty-five francs.
It will not be for sale in the usual manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
by booksellers, and we therefore
make special mention of it. Persons
desiring to obtain it may address the

The first edition, commenced by Fathers
Augustin and Alois de Backer,
appeared in 1855, in seven vols. 8vo.
The new edition, besides being in a single
alphabetical series, will contain numerous
corrections and additions. It
also contains articles on controversies
of special interest, such as the publication
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acta Sanctorum</i>, the origin

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Lectures and Essays on Irish
and other Subjects.</span> By Henry
Giles. New York: D. &amp; J. Sadlier
&amp; Co.</p>

<p>Besides biographical lectures on
O'Connell, Curran, Dr. Doyle, Oliver
Goldsmith, and Gerald Griffin, this volume
contains other lectures on the
spirit of Irish history, Irish social character,
etc., which many of our readers
have, doubtless, heard delivered by
the author in his pleasant and effective
style.</p>

<p>Mr. Giles is of Irish birth, and for
many years officiated and preached as a
Unitarian minister. There can be no
doubt that his Irish patriotism is sincere
and enthusiastic, and yet, as we
read, we feel as though something were
wanting. For reasons that can be perfectly
well understood without detailed
explanation, Irish patriotic character
always appears incomplete without
Catholicity. Oliver Goldsmith and the
Duke of Wellington are as much of
Irish birth as Dr. Doyle and Daniel
O'Connell; but how much more essentially
Irish to every one are the two latter
than the two former. The Catholic
reader of these lectures sadly misses
what he feels to be most essential.
Take, for instance, the lectures on
O'Connell, Gerald Griffin, and Dr.
Doyle, which are among the best, and he
perceives the absence of an element of
appreciation that nothing but Catholic
sympathy could supply. These papers
have high merit as oral lectures, and
precisely because of this merit they fall
short of their reputation when read.
The effective lecture is not necessarily
an effective essay. There are certain
elements nowadays almost indispensable
to the success of a lecture, and they
happen to be precisely those which detract
from its literary merit. The redundancy
of anecdote is one of these
elements, and Mr. Giles was strongly
given to it.</p>

<p>The book is, nevertheless, pleasant
reading, although such essays as "The
Christian Idea in Catholic Art and in
Protestant Culture" afford additional
proof&mdash;if any were needed&mdash;of the barrenness
of Protestantism in art.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Order and Chaos</span>: A Lecture, delivered
at Loyola College, Baltimore,
in July, 1869. By T. W. M. Marshall,
Esq. Baltimore: John Murphy &amp;
Co. 1869.</p>

<p>Mr. Marshall, who is both one of
the most solid and altogether the wittiest
of English writers, delivered this
lecture in Baltimore before a select audience,
on the eve of his return to England.
It is a well-reasoned argument,
clothed in the author's usual choice and
happy style, and spiced with a seasonable
amount of his humor. Its topic is
the order prevailing in the Catholic
Church contrasted with the disorder
which rules among the sects, as a proof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
that the former is of God, while the latter
are of man. We quote the following
extract, which contains a well-delivered
blow at the disunionists:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You are asked to believe, by those who
prefer the temple of chaos to the sanctuary
of God, this monstrous proposition:
that although disorder is inexorably banished,
as we have seen, from every other part
of his dominions, as a thing abhorrent to
the Divine Architect, it finds its true home
and congenial refuge precisely in that spiritual
kingdom of which he is at once the
lawgiver and the life. Brute matter knows
nothing of it; earth, and sea, and sky refuse
to give it a place; the very beasts of
the field obey a law which regulates all the
conditions of their existence; but confusion
and chaos, which can find a home nowhere
else, reign, and ought to reign, in the Christian
church, and in the kingdom of souls!
That is the proposition which is deliberately
maintained, at this hour and in this land,
by men whose profession it is to teach others
eternal truth. They gravely assert that religion&mdash;which,
when it is divine, is a bond
of union stronger than adamant, and when
it is human, is the most active dissolvent,
the most powerful disintegrating agent
which divides and devastates modern society&mdash;<em>gains</em>
by ceasing to be one, and that
Christianity derives its chief vitality from
the very divisions which make it contemptible
in the sight of unbelievers, and had
often provoked the scorn and derision even
of the pagan world. As this statement may
seem to you impossible, even in this nineteenth
century, which is tolerant of all absurdities
in the sphere of religion, I will
quote to you the very words of one of the
most conspicuous preachers of this land,
who holds a high position in the hierarchy
of chaos. I take them from one of your
own local journals, of the second of this
month, (June.) You know that of late
years many Protestants, weary of their
ceaseless conflicts and ashamed of their unending
divisions, have begun at last to sigh
for the unity which they have lost, and that
in England they have even formed a society
with the express object of bringing together
what they ignorantly call 'the different
branches of the church.' We are told, however,
by the journal to which I allude, that
the Reverend Henry Ward Beecher, vehemently
rejecting every such project, lately
'preached against the schemes of church
union, whether planned by pope, protestant,
or pagan'&mdash;pray understand that these are
not my words&mdash;and added this characteristic
dissuasive from unity. 'The strength of
the Christian religion lies,' he said&mdash;in what
do you suppose? in its truth, its holiness,
or its peace? no, but&mdash;'<em>in the number of the
existing denominations</em>.' The hands fall down
in reading such words. 'I pray,' said He
who will judge the world, 'that they may
all be <em>one</em> as thou, Father, art in me, and I
in thee.' I sincerely trust, replies Mr.
Beecher, that they never will be one. 'Be
perfect,' said St. Paul, 'in the <em>same mind</em>
and the <em>same judgment</em>.' It is much more
important, rejoins Mr. Beecher, that you
should maintain your divisions and perpetuate
your differences, for in <em>them</em> lies the
strength of Christianity. 'Sects,' observed
the same apostle, 'are the work of the flesh.'
Mr. Beecher judges them more leniently,
and warns his hearers, as you see, against
the mistake of St. Paul. Yes, these human
teachers have come at last to this. They
know so well that supernatural unity is beyond
<em>their</em> reach, that they have come to
hate it, and to call it an evil! Yet even
they will not deny that it was the unity of
the first Christians which conquered the
heathen world; and when the victory was
accomplished, and the surviving pagans had
only strength enough left to beat themselves
against the ground where they had fallen,
<em>they</em> also cried out in their impotent rage,
'<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Execranda est ista consensio</i>'&mdash;cursed be this
unity of the Christians. They had found
it to be invincible, but did not know that it
was divine. Mr. Beecher dares not say
openly, 'Cursed be the unity for which
Christ prayed,' for even his disciples, though
they can bear a good deal, could not bear
<em>that</em>; but he is not afraid to say, 'Blessed
be chaos!' 'Confusion, thou art my choice!'
'Disorder, be thou mine inheritance!' Let
us wish him a happier lot, both in this world
and the next."</p></blockquote>

or, Solace for the Suffering.</span>
From the French of the Rev. Father
Blot, S.J. New York: The Catholic
Publication Society. 1869.</p>

<p>We would call special attention to
this delightful little book. The lady
translator has conferred a very great
service on English-speaking Catholics;
nor on Catholics alone, but also on all
professing Christians "of good-will,"
who,</p>

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>
<p>in order to satisfy one of their deepest
and holiest cravings, and not having
known the Catholic Church, nor therefore
"the communion of saints," have
turned&mdash;and <em>most</em> naturally&mdash;into paths
which only lead to deception and despair.</p>

<p>The book before us supplies to "the
afflicted" who mourn the loss of friends
a consolation as solid as it is abundant:
a proof on unshakable grounds of
truths which seem to be forgotten
even by some among Catholics; that
human ties <em>do</em> survive the grave; that</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There the cherished heart <em>is</em> fond,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The eye the same, except in tears;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and that the knowledge and love of
creatures must necessarily form an integral
part of the happiness of heaven.
The reader will be astonished to see
what Catholic saints and doctors have
said on this subject; and what a stress
they have laid on it as a part of their
own hopes and anticipations. To those,
too, in particular, who are tempted to despair
of the departed, an antidote is here
offered for this poison of their rest; an
antidote which, we are sure, has long
been needed by many an anxious heart.</p>

<p>In commending this book, then, to
Catholics, we would urge them to put
it as much as possible in the hands
of non-Catholic friends. The success
of a recent work, entitled <i>The Gates
Ajar</i>, is evidence enough of the hunger
that exists in <em>all</em> souls for food of this
kind. And why should any be left to
pick up crumbs, when a full table invites
them? A perusal of <i>In Heaven
We Know Our Own</i> may open the
eyes of many to the glorious fact it is
our privilege to know&mdash;that the Catholic
religion embraces <em>all</em> truth, and
alone can satisfy <em>all</em> the soul's cravings:</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Two Years before the Mast.</span> A
Personal Narrative by Richard Henry
Dana, Jr. New edition. Boston:
Fields, Osgood &amp; Co. 1869.</p>

<p>Twelve years ago we determined
upon a voyage similar to that the author
describes, and from a similar motive.</p>

<p>This recital of his two years' experience
before the mast was put into our
hands to deter us from going. We recollect
reading it with the greatest interest,
and being afterward more anxious to
go than ever. After three years' experience,
during which we shared all the
sailor's toils and pleasures "fore and
aft," we returned to a student's life. It
was therefore with some curiosity we reopened
this book to see what our judgment
would be of this sailor's yarn as
compared with our own experience.</p>

<p>Before, it had the charm of adventure
untried; now it gave the pleasure of
again, in imagination, riding the topsail
yard-arm amid the wild storm, hauling
out the "weather earing," and "sending
her" off the Cape with all hands
lashed to the rigging. We have never
read so vivid yet truthful a description
of a sailor's life. It is refreshing to see
for once nautical terms correctly and
naturally used. We suspect that the
author's estimate of the character and
religion of the people he visited has
changed since he wrote. The condition
of the Mexicans now, as compared
with their peace and prosperity
under the paternal care of the Catholic
missionaries, would surely warrant it.</p>

<p>We heartily sympathize with the author
in his desire to better the condition
of seamen. They are a noble, large-hearted
class of men. We never expect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
to meet more courageous, generous,
faithful men than our comrades at
sea. Yet their life, which must be full
of toil and danger, is made unnecessarily
hard and laborious by unjust treatment.
They are over-worked and half-fed at
sea, and swindled on shore. If among
the various protective societies, one
were organized to protect seamen from
shipping masters, brutal officers, and
"boarding-house runners," it would be

of Henry Crabb Robinson.</span>
Selected and edited by
Thomas Sadler, Ph.D. 2 vols.
12mo. Pp. 496, 555. Boston:
Fields, Osgood &amp; Co.</p>

<p>In the United States, it is only the
readers of the literary biography of the
last generation that know Henry Crabb
Robinson even by name; for although
he was intimately acquainted with some
scores of distinguished men, and moved
in the best literary society of
England, he left little or nothing to recall
his memory after he was dead, except
the immense piles of manuscript
from which these two volumes have
been selected. These, we venture to
predict, will enjoy a permanent place in
literature, not much below the <i>Diary</i>
of Pepys and Boswell's <i>Life of Johnson</i>.
Mr. Robinson, however, had nothing
of the Pepys or the Boswell in
his character. He was a man of sharp
natural faculties, excellent scholarship,
abundant wit, eminent social accomplishments,
and strong character. In
his youth he was a foreign correspondent
and sub-editor of <cite>The Times</cite>.
Afterward he practised at the bar.
But for the most important part of his
life, covering a period of some thirty
years before his death, he had no profession,
and passed his time in the society
of literary and other celebrities,
with whom, for his extraordinary conversational
powers and more sterling
qualities, he was always a welcome
guest. It is to his anecdotes and recollections
of such men&mdash;Lamb, Wordsworth,
Southey, Byron, Coleridge,
Moore, Rogers, Goethe, Lady Morgan,
Lady Blessington, Landor, and others&mdash;told
with spirit and discretion, that
the <i>Diary and Reminiscences</i> owe
their value. The work of selection
and arrangement has been performed
with excellent judgment, and no one
who takes up the volumes will readily
lay them aside.</p>

Descriptive Astronomy</span>; for the
use of Colleges and Academies. By

Professor of Astronomy and Navigation

Academy. 16mo, 272 pp. Philadelphia:

<p>Most writers of text-books, probably,
are impelled to their task by an impression
that a void exists which only can
be filled by a work answering to a conception
which they have formed in the
course of their studies. This arises
from the fact that few subjects of study
can be thoroughly mastered by merely
imbibing the ideas of another person,
and that consequently every one who
spends much time in acquiring, or particularly
in teaching, any science, is
obliged to think a good deal upon the
subject, and hence to arrange it almost
necessarily in his own mind in a different
shape, and probably one better
adapted to himself, than that in which
it was presented to him. Finding nothing
just like this among existing text-books,
he naturally concludes that the
really systematic arrangement has yet
to be given, and by himself.</p>

<p>This every teacher perhaps is tempted
to do; but unfortunately, the best
teachers, who perceive what difficulties
are met with by the mass of students,
sometimes deny themselves the pleasure,
or are perhaps unable to indulge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
in it, while others supply books suited
only to a few. Sometimes, also, no
void remains, having been already
filled. But in this subject of astronomy
there certainly was a need of a new
work sufficiently precise and condensed
to present salient points to the mind of
the student, and form matter for a recitation,
without being unnecessarily technical
and uninteresting. Herschel's
<i>Outlines</i>, though an interesting and
thoroughly scientific work, and clear in
its explanations, is rather fit to be read
than to be studied or recited from; yet
this was undoubtedly the best book for
those not wishing to pursue astronomy
professionally, but merely to acquire a
sufficient knowledge of it for a liberal
education, or to understand navigation
and other branches of knowledge in
which it is involved.</p>

<p>Mr. White's book is exactly what was
wanted for this purpose, supplying all
Herschel's defects for the student, being
nearly or quite as clear, and much more
concise. It also contains other matters
which would not usually be found except
in works on what is called practical
astronomy, but which are necessary
for any one who desires to make use of
his knowledge; which end is also secured
throughout by the precise and
definite form in which every thing is
treated. One often fancies he understands
a subject, but finds that his
knowledge is unavailable from not being
sufficiently in detail.</p>

<p>The author has a thorough acquaintance
with his science, and remarkable
natural ability as a teacher, developed
by long experience. It will be a decided
waste of time for any one to undertake
a similar book till the progress of
science renders large additions to this
absolutely necessary; and this is
brought up to the actual date of publication,
containing the latest results of the
spectroscope, and the most recent determinations
of the astronomical constants.</p>

Though Patty was a little girl,

She thought, too, "she could never love

her uncle Tom and other relatives
dearly. If the preface had been left
out, the book might be a good one for

for them to have all the abuses of slavery
served up again and again. That
evil has been done away with, and, at

<p>No man in our day should attempt
to solve the religious question without
a competent knowledge of the basis of
the claims of the Catholic Church to
being the church of God and her faith
the true Christian faith. Her claim is
prior to all others as an historical fact,
and must be fairly set aside before
another can be allowed to come into
court. The author of the above autobiography
is, as is usual with the opponents
of the Catholic Church, sadly
lacking in this knowledge. Among
other absurdities, he tells us gravely that
"the Roman Catholic Church was
founded by Leo the Great"! Well, after
all, that is an improvement on Rev.
Justin D. Fulton, of Boston, who affirms,
"Romanism is the masterpiece
of Satan."</p>

<p>The author appears to possess a
smattering knowledge of several things,
and an exact and thorough knowledge
of none. His book is a jumble of materialism
and spiritualism, of infidelity,
Protestantism, and credulity.</p>

the Order of the Vesper Service, the
Gregorian Psalm Tones harmonized,
with the Psalms for all Vespers during
the year pointed for chanting.
By Rev. Alfred Young. New York:
The Catholic Publication House.
1869.</p>

<p>Father Young has given us, we are
glad to see, strictly Gregorian melodies,
both in the ritual of the vesper service
and in the psalm tones, such as are to
be found in authorized editions of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Antiphonale Romanum</i>. This is something
we commend with all our heart.
The melodies commonly found in our
"choir books," "vesperals," and "services,"
are for the most part so garbled,
both in the inflections and arrangements,
as to leave very little of the
original Gregorian tone standing. The
chief merit of the book, however, consists
in a new division of the tones, and
of the psalms, by which but one pointing
of the psalms is needed for chanting
any one of the tones with their
varied concluding cadences. Father
Maugin attempted something of this
kind in his <i>Roman Vesperal</i>, but succeeded
only in reducing the different
pointings to four. The simplicity of
Father Young's arrangement cannot
fail to be appreciated by organists as
well as by the singers. With his book
in our choirs we need not be condemned
to hear the tiresome repetition of the
same five psalms sung to the same five
tones on every Sunday and festival in
the year. We hope the author will find
sufficient success with the present publication
to give us, as he proposes, the
<i>Hymnal</i> and <i>Antiphonal</i>. With these
we can have our vespers chanted as
they should be, in their truly effective
style and religious spirit, in comparison
to which our so-called "musical vespers"
are tame, unmeaning, and, spiritually,
unprofitable.</p>

<h2>THE LIFE OF FATHER FABER.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></h2>


<p>In the life of Father Faber there
was no sudden and violent change
from the excitement of worldly affairs
to the quiet of the cloister, no striking
intervention of divine Providence,
such as that which in a single day
converted Ignatius from a courtier to
a saint. He suffered, it is true, from
spiritual conflicts and that rupture of
natural ties which for so many converts
to the faith is little short of a
species of martyrdom; but the tender
piety which beams from all his
maturer devotional works seems to
have filled his heart from boyhood,
and his progress from heresy to faith
was like the gradual development of
a seed planted in his breast in early
youth. Yet it is hardly in the Faber
family that we should have looked
for a phenomenon like this. They
were of Huguenot origin, and proud
of their religious ancestry; and their
exiled forefathers, who settled in England
after the revocation of the Edict
of Nantes, we may fairly presume
were honored in the family as confessors
of the faith. The grandfather
of the subject of these pages was the
Reverend Thomas Faber, vicar of
Calverley, in Yorkshire. Frederick
William was born at the vicarage,
on the 28th of June, 1814. His father,
Mr. Thomas Henry Faber, was
soon afterward appointed secretary to
the Bishop of Durham, and removed
with his family to the episcopal domain
of Bishop Auckland. Durham
had not yet lost its dignity as a
County Palatine, and in the glories of
the ancient city, where the bishop held
his court with all the pomp and something
of the power of royalty, there
was much to impress a warm poetical
imagination, like that of young
Faber. The poetical faculty was afterward
fostered by the beautiful scenery
of the Lake country, when he
was sent to school at Kirkby Stephen,
in Westmoreland. There it was his
chief delight to ramble alone among
the hills and meres, and fancy the
chases filled again with deer, the forests
resounding with the hunter's
horn, the ruined halls and castles resonant
with feast and song, and the
deserted abbeys vocal with prayer
and chant. He shows his familiarity
with this region in some of his published
verses. Subsequently, he studied
at Harrow, under Doctor Longley,
afterward Archbishop of Canterbury,
by whose kindness and influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
he was reclaimed at a time
when he had adopted infidel views.
He gave himself with all his heart to
the study of English literature; but
the classics got rather less attention
from him than they deserved, and his
career at Oxford, where he was matriculated
at Baliol College, in 1832,
cannot be called a brilliant one. He
was a man of scholarly tastes and of
scholarly attainments as well, yet in
certain of the highest requirements
of the university he seems to have
fallen short; for we hear of his failing
once or twice, not indeed in his examinations,
but in competition for a
distinguished place. The fact probably
was, that he applied himself
with undue partiality to favorite studies,
such as poetry and divinity.
He was remarkable even at this time
for graces of person and manner, fine
conversational powers, and a rare
faculty of attracting friends, notwithstanding
a certain dangerous keenness
in his perceptions of the ludicrous,
coupled with great frankness
in the expression of his feelings. "I
cannot tell why it is," said one of his
schoolmates at Harrow, "but that
Faber fascinates every body." This
remark was repeated to him afterward,
and filled him with a sense of
obligation to use the gift in promoting
God's glory.</p>

<p>The temporary eclipse of faith to
which we have alluded was of very
short duration; and when he came to
Oxford, he was keenly alive to religious
impressions, with a strong Calvinistic
tendency. The tractarian movement,
however, was just beginning, and
Faber became an enthusiastic admirer&mdash;"an
acolyth," as he expressed
it&mdash;of John Henry Newman, who
was then preaching at St. Mary's,
Oxford. He did not make Mr.
Newman's acquaintance till several
years later; but under his influence
he forgot his evangelicalism, and
threw himself eagerly into the great
movement for the revival of church
principles as expounded in the <cite>Tracts
for the Times</cite>. "Transubstantiation
has been bothering me," he wrote to
a friend; "not that I lean to it, <em>but I
have seen no refutation of it</em>. How
can it be absurd and contradictory to
the evidence of our senses, when they
cannot by any means take cognizance
of the unknown being, substance,
which alone is held up as the
subject of this conversion?"</p>

<p>This tendency toward Catholic
truth was but slight, however, and
evanescent. There came a reaction
in the course of a little while, and
Mr. Faber wrote to one of his
friends:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have been thinking a great deal on
the merits and tendency of Newmanism,
and I have become more than ever convinced
of its falsehood.... What makes me
fear most is, that I have seen Newman himself
<em>growing</em> in his opinions; I have seen
indistinct visions become distinct embodiments;
I have seen the conclusion of one
proposition become the premiss of a next,
through a long series: all this is still going
on&mdash;to my eyes more like the blind march
of error than the steady uniformity of truth&mdash;and
I know not when it will stop."</p></blockquote>

<p>How thoroughly his mind and
heart were taken up with religious
problems we can see in almost every
letter. One of the correspondents to
whom he seems to have expressed
himself with the fullest freedom was
Mr. John Brande Morris, and to him
he writes, in 1834:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When, after writing to you, and one or
two other relations and friends, I turn to
pen a letter to my literary intellectual
friends, you cannot conceive how weak and
uninteresting the topics of discussion become.
It is like one of Tom Moore's melodies
after an Handelian chorus, at once ludicrous
and disgusting from its inferiority."</p></blockquote>

<p>He read a great deal of religious
biography, and when he saw "the
maturity of faith and the religious
perfection to which many good men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
arrive so early," he felt disheartened
at his own condition. "It is true,"
he said, "I have often had hours of
ecstatic, enthusiastic devotion; but
the fever has soon subsided, and my
feelings have flowed on calmly and
soberly in their accustomed channels."
He looked for the fruits of
his faith and found none. Yet in his
ignorance of what constitutes the
true spiritual life, Faber, in his earnest
search after perfection, was
doubtless much nearer to God than
the evangelical saints whose condition
he so envied. He was soon surrounded
at Oxford by a little circle
of admirers, who made him, in some
sort, the exemplar and guide of their
religious life. He was about twenty
or twenty-one years of age when he
began a systematic effort to improve
the opportunities for doing good
which he believed had thus been providentially
opened to him. "I proceeded,"
he wrote soon afterward, "to
dictate, to organize, so to speak, a
system of aggressive efforts in favor
of religion; and under my guidance
a number of prayer-meetings was
speedily established; and by God's
grace I was enabled to do it with
little noise or ostentation." In another
letter he describes the perplexity
which he suffered during a vacation
visit to one of his disciples, who
had "declined from his Christian
profession," and manifested an unregenerate
fondness for the pleasures
of life, balls, theatres, etc., which are
generally so attractive to the young.
Mr. Faber had little difficulty in reasserting
his influence; but his
friend's father had "a violent prejudice
against what he called 'the
humbug of evangelicals,'" and
strongly disapproved of the enthusiastic
views of the little Oxford coterie.
Mr. Faber could not hold his
tongue and let the son alone; he
trembled at the thought of breeding
domestic dissension; and he could
not break off his visit without giving
offence. It would be interesting to
know how he got out of the difficulty,
but he does not tell us.</p>

<p>There soon came a time when he
discovered that, however Calvinism
might answer for seasons of religious
excitement and spiritual exaltation,
it was not fit for the daily food of the
soul. He could not always be at
a prayer-meeting or an exhortation.
Secular studies exacted most of his
time, and he felt then that there was
nothing for him to lean upon. Another
change in his religious views
was the inevitable consequence. He
had been for some time an admiring
student of the works of George Herbert;
Herbert led him on to Bishop
Andrewes; the necessity of sacraments,
the prerogatives of the church,
the "penitential system of the primitive
church," and "the girdle of celibacy
and the lamp of watching" became
subjects of frequent recurrence in his
letters; he confessed that "the evangelical
system feeds the heart at the
expense of the head," and "makes
religion a series of frames of feeling;"
and before long we find him quoting
with approbation the writings of Dr.
Wiseman. He was indeed steadily
advancing toward the Catholic
Church, though he was far enough
from suspecting it. In June, 1836,
he writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Newman is delivering lectures against
the Church of Rome. I have just come
from a magnificent one on Peter's prerogative.
He admits the text in its full literal
completeness, and shows that it makes not
one iota for the jurisdiction of the Bishop
of Rome."</p></blockquote>

<p>It was well that he was getting even
by these slow degrees to a more
comfortable faith; for in his university
career he was destined to suffer,
just at this time, several severe trials.
He had carried off, in 1836, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
prize for a poem on <i>The Knights of
St. John</i>; but in the examination
for his degree he made a comparative
failure, his name appearing only
in the second class, and, as a consequence
of this misfortune, he was
also defeated in a contest for a fellowship
in his own college. To divert
his mind from this double mortification
and recruit his exhausted
strength, he made a short visit to
Germany with his brother, the Reverend
Francis A. Faber. Soon after
his return, he secured a fellowship at
University College, and also carried
off the Johnson divinity scholarship,
for which there was a strong competition.
His position being now secure,
he began to prepare himself
zealously for orders. He made the
acquaintance of Doctor Newman,
and joined in his scheme for compiling
the <i>Library of the Fathers</i>, undertaking,
as his share of the work,
to translate the <i>Books of St. Optatus
against the Donatists</i>. He obtained
a few pupils, and during the vacation
accompanied a small reading party
to Ambleside, near the head of Windermere.
There he was fortunate
enough to form a friendship with
Wordsworth, and used to spend long
days rambling with the poet over the
neighboring mountains&mdash;Wordsworth
muttering verses in the intervals of
conversation. His correspondence
is full of admiring allusions to Wordsworth's
poetry, "Well or sick," he
says, "cheerful or sad, I can almost always
get happiness and quiet and good
resolves out of the old poet&mdash;God
bless him! One may hang on one
sonnet of his by the hour, like a bee
in a fox-glove, and still get sweetness."
His opinions of some other
famous poets would be declared unquestionably
heterodox. He wrote
to his brother from Italy in 1843:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I spent a <em>delicious</em> evening at Fiesole,
yesterday, and not being, as I had feared,
tormented by a single thought of the execrable
rebel and heretic, Milton, I had nothing
to disturb the beautiful tranquillity of
the sunset, and the rosy mists of the garden-like
Valdarno.... England has
no 'need' of Milton: how can a country
have need of any thing, policy, courage, talent,
or any thing else, which is unblessed
of God; and how can any talent in any subject-matter
be blessed by the Eternal Father
for one who, in prose and verse, denied,
ridiculed, blasphemed the Godhead of the
Eternal Son? Milton (accursed be his
blasphemous memory) spent a great part
of his life in writing down my Lord's divinity&mdash;my
sole trust, my sole love; and that
thought poisons <i>Comus</i>."</p></blockquote>

<p>For Byron, "the beast who thrust
Christ into company with Jove and
Mohammed"&mdash;Byron, "trampling
under foot his duties to his country,
and scorning the natural pieties," his
antipathy amounted to loathing. "I
must say that I cannot comprehend
the anomaly which strikes me both in
guide-books and conversation of quoting
and praising men like Milton
and Byron, when a man professes to
love Christ and to put all his hopes
of salvation in him."</p>

<p>Mr. Faber's old master at Harrow,
Doctor Longley, now Bishop
of Ripon, ordained him deacon in
1837, and Bishop Bagot promoted
him to the priesthood at Oxford in
1839. Meanwhile, he had spent the
long vacations at Ambleside, assisting
there in parochial work, and preaching
twice a week, and the rest of the
year he had passed among his books
at Oxford. A devoted Anglican at
this time, and full of hope that the
movement guided by Pusey, Newman,
and their associates would revolutionize
the whole English establishment,
he had gone so far toward
Catholicism that when, just after his
ordination as priest, he made a second
visit to the continent, he wrote to the
Rev. J. B. Morris the following curious
letter from Cologne:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I fear you will think me a sad Protestant.
I determined, and so did M&mdash;&mdash;, to
conform to the Catholic ritual here. We
both of us got Mechlin breviaries at Mechlin,
and go to church pretty regularly every day
to say the hours, and we say the rest of the
hours as the priests do, in carriages, or
inns, or anywhere. Also, I have been tutorized
in the breviary by a very <em>nice</em> priest, a
simple-hearted, pious fellow with little
knowledge of theology. But it all will not
do. The careless irreverence, the noise,
the going in and out, the spitting of the
priests on the altar-steps, the distressing
representations of our Blessed Lord&mdash;I cannot
get over them. The censing of the
priests, the ringing of bells, the constant
carrying of the blessed sacrament from one
altar to another&mdash;this I can manage; because
I can say psalms meanwhile. But at
best, when I can get away into a side chapel
with no wax virgins in it, and no hideous
pictures of the <span class="smcap">Father</span>, I cannot manage
well."</p></blockquote>

<p>The idea that Anglicans were excommunicate
from Western Christendom
was a terrible distress to him.
"Would you not like," he writes to
the same friend, "to spend six months
among the Munich disciples of Möhler,
Döllinger, etc., etc.? Of course
I shall know more of all this when I
have travelled. I shall strive to realize
all such little ways of impeded
communion as are unstopped. It
will surely do <em>me</em> good, if no one else."</p>

<p>He soon had the coveted opportunity
for more extended travel; for in
1841, he went abroad as tutor to a
young gentleman from Ambleside,
and spent six months journeying
through the countries bordering on
the Mediterranean and the Danube,
Styria, the Tyrol, and Northern Germany.
Memorials of this interesting
tour are found in some of his published
poems and in a volume called
<i>Sights and Thoughts in Foreign
Churches and among Foreign Peoples</i>,
which appeared in 1842, dedicated
to Wordsworth. Into this book the
author introduced many reflections
upon religious matters, chiefly in the
form of conversations with an imaginary
representative of mediæval Christianity,
as well as of Mr. Faber's own
Catholic feelings, whom he calls "the
Stranger." The volume closes with
a dream, in which the author conducts
the stranger through English
cathedrals, with their bare altars and
empty niches. "The stranger regarded
them with indignation, but
did not speak. When we came out
of the church, he turned to me, and
said in a solemn voice, somewhat
tremulous from deep emotion, 'You
have led me through a land of closed
churches and hushed bells, of unlighted
altars and unstoled priests.
Is England beneath an interdict?'"</p>

<p>The private journal of Mr. Faber's
journey abounds with evidences of
the deep impressions which Catholic
customs made upon him, and his secret
dissatisfaction with his own cold
church&mdash;a dissatisfaction of which
probably he was still himself unconscious.
He is at Genoa on the Feast
of the Annunciation, "and not to
be utterly without sympathy with the
Genoese around us, we decorated our
room with a bunch of crimson tulips,
apparently the favorite flower, that
we might not be without somewhat
to remind us of her</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Who so above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All mothers shone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Mother of<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Blessed One.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In Constantinople he is impressed
with the folly of patching up the Anglican
succession by an alliance with
the Greek Church. "Depend upon
it," he writes, "cast about as we will,
if we want foreign Catholic sympathies,
we must find them as they will
let us in our Latin mother." He
witnesses a procession of pilgrims
from Vienna to the shrine of the
Blessed Virgin at Mariazell. "It was
a bewildering sight. I thought how
faith ran in my own country in thin
and scattered rivulets, and I looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
with envious surprise at this huge
wave which the Austrian capital had
flung upon this green platform of
Styrian highland&mdash;a wave of pure,
hearty, earnest faith." He is indignant
at the desecration of Sunday by
the Lutheran population of Dresden,
and exclaims, "Yet year after year
are we assured in England of the
connection between popery and whatever
is disagreeable in the foreign
way of keeping Sunday. No person
who has not been abroad, and
heard and seen and investigated for
himself, would credit the extensive
system of lying pursued by English
travel-writers, religious-tract compilers,
and Exeter Hall speech-makers, respecting
the Roman Church abroad;
and whether the lies be those of wilfulness
or of prejudice, ignorance, and
indolence, I do not see much to distinguish
in the guilt. These dirt-seekers
scrape the sewers of Europe
to rough-cast the Church of Rome
with the plentiful defilements."</p>

<p>Soon after his return home, he
was offered the college living of
Elton, in Huntingdonshire, and at
first declined it, but afterward, for a
reason which curiously illustrates his
conscientiousness, he determined to
accept. "My chief rock of offence,"
said he, "is the subduing the poet
to the priest." He would have given
up poetry altogether, but Keble convinced
him that he had no right to
bury his chief talent in a napkin.
To cultivate it in moderation was
more difficult, and here he thought
the uncongenial duties of the pastoral
office would be a great help in
correcting his inordinate love of literature,
and keeping him within the
bounds of usefulness. "I do not
say you are wrong," was Wordsworth's
remark on hearing his determination;
"but England loses a poet."</p>

<p>If his reason for accepting the
rectory was a strange one, his first
step on taking possession was still
stranger and still wiser. He determined
to visit Rome and study the
method pursued by the church in
dealing with the souls committed to
her care. "I want to go to Italy,"
said he, "not as a poet, or a tourist,
or a pleased dreamer, but as a pilgrim
who regards it as a second
Palestine, the Holy Land of the West."
Dr. Wiseman, then coadjutor bishop
of the central district of England,
gave him letters of introduction to
Cardinal Acton and Dr. Grant at
Rome, so that he was enabled to see
much more of the charitable and religious
institutions of the Christian
capital than falls to the lot of the ordinary
visitor. He studied Italian,
in order that he might understand
the numerous lives of saints in that
language, and singularly enough, or
providentially we should rather say,
he conceived a particular devotion to
St. Philip Neri, his future father. Of
his visit to the room in which the
saint used to say Mass he writes,
"How little did I, a Protestant
stranger in that room years ago,
dream that I should ever be of the
saint's family, or that the Oratorian
father who showed it me should in a
few years be appointed by the pope
the novice-master of the English Oratorians.
I remember how, when he
kissed the glass of the case in which
St. Philip's little bed is kept as a relic,
he apologized to me as a Protestant,
lest I should be scandalized, and told
me with a smile how tenderly St.
Philip's children loved their father.
I was not scandalized with their relic-worship
then, but I can understand
better now what he said about the
love, the child-like love, wherewith
St. Philip inspired his sons. If any
one had told me that in seven short
years I should wear the same habit,
and the same white collar in the
streets of London, and be preaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
a triduo in honor of Rome's apostle,
I should have wondered how any
one could dream so wild a dream."</p>

<p>Sensibly as he was affected by
the pious practices and associations
of Rome, his attachment to the
Church of England was as yet unshaken.
He still cherished the delusion
that some way could be found of
connecting the Anglican establishment
with this venerable apostolic church.
Controversy on such points of doctrine
as indulgences, etc., he put aside.
"The one thing necessary to prove,"
said he, "is that adherence to the
holy see is essential to the <em>being</em> of a
church: <i>to the</i> well-<i>being of all
churches I admit it essential</i>." He
visited the church of the Lateran on
St. John's day, and knelt bare-headed
in the piazza to receive the holy
father's blessing. "I do not think,"
he writes, "I ever returned from any
service so thoroughly christianized
in every joint and limb, or so right
of heart, as I did from the Lateran
on Thursday." Afterward Cardinal
Acton obtained for him the favor of
a private audience with Pope Gregory
XVI., the story of which he tells
in the following words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Rector of the English College accompanied
me, and told me that, as Protestants
did not like kissing the pope's foot,
I should not be required to do it. We
waited in the lobby of the Vatican library
for half an hour, when the pope arrived,
and a prelate opened the door, remaining
outside. The pope was perfectly alone,
without a courtier or prelate, standing in
the middle of the library, in a plain white
cassock, and a white silk skull-cap, (white
is the papal color.) On entering, I knelt
down, and again when a few yards from
him, and lastly before him; he held out
his hand, but I kissed his foot; there seemed
to be a mean puerility in refusing the
customary homage. With Dr. Baggs for
interpreter, we had a long conversation; he
spoke of Dr. Pusey's suspension for defending
the Catholic doctrine of the Eucharist
with amazement and disgust; he said to
me, 'You must not mislead yourself in
wishing for unity, yet waiting for your
<em>church</em> to move. Think of the salvation of
your own soul.' I said I feared self-will
and <em>individual</em> judging. He said, 'You
are all individuals in the English church;
you have only external communion and
the accident of being all under the queen.
You know this; you know all doctrines
are taught amongst you, any how. You
have good wishes; may God strengthen
them! You must think for yourself and
for your soul.' He then laid his hands on
my shoulders, and I immediately knelt
down; upon which he laid them on my
head, and said, 'May the grace of God
correspond to your good wishes and deliver
you from the nets (<i>insidie</i>) of Anglicanism,
and bring you to the true holy church!' I
left him almost in tears, affected as much
by the earnest, affectionate demeanor of the
old man as by his blessing and his prayer.
I shall remember St. Alban's day in 1843 to
my life's end."</p></blockquote>

<p>That he did not immediately embrace
the truth seems to have been
not the effect of cowardice, but of a
genuine scruple such as he expressed
to Pope Gregory. The Anglican
party at this time were sanguine of
their ability to bring their members,
as a body, into communion with the
Roman see, and Mr. Faber was
doubtless conscientious in his delay,
though he suffered terribly from distress
of mind. "I grow more Roman
every day," he writes. "I hardly
dare read the Articles; their weight
grows heavier on me daily. <i>I hope
our Blessed Lady's intercession may
not cease for any of us</i> because we do
not seek it, since we desist for obedience'
sake." He prayed at the shrine
of St. Aloysius on the feast of that
saint, and left the church as if speechless
and not knowing where he was
going. After he became a Catholic,
he told Dr. Grant that on the 21st
of June St. Aloysius "had always
knocked very hard at his heart."
Twice he took his hat to go to the
English College and make his abjuration,
but on each occasion some
trifling circumstance interfered to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the execution of his purpose.
He wore a miraculous medal, and he
obtained some rosaries blessed by
the pope. At last he went home to
Elton, having suffered during his
visit a degree of mental anguish
which actually resulted in physical
injuries that affected him all the rest
of his life.</p>

<p>Dr. Newman's state of mind was
very much like Mr. Faber's at this
time. The two friends wrote to each
other, and agreed to delay their final
decision for a little while longer; and
in the mean time Mr. Faber threw all
his energy into his parochial duties,
endeavoring to copy the methods of
pastoral labor which he had gone to
Rome to study. His parish was disorderly
in consequence of long neglect,
and what religious vitality there
was in the place was found principally
at the dissenting chapel. Mr.
Faber relied for reformation upon
preaching, and what he considered
the sacraments. He cared very little
for ceremonies and vestments, and
compared those who would now be
called ritualists to "grown-up children
playing at mass, putting ornament
before truth, suffocating the inward
by the outward." "This is not
the way to become Catholic again;
it is only a profaner kind of Protestantism
than any we have seen hitherto."
When the surplice controversy
was agitating the Established
Church, he told his congregation that
he usually preached in a surplice because
he preferred it, but he "would
preach <em>in his shirt-sleeves</em> if it would
be any satisfaction to them." He
tried to establish the devotion to
the Sacred Heart of Jesus; he published
three tracts on examination of
conscience; he introduced confessions,
and out of the most promising
of his young male penitents he formed
a confraternity which used to meet
at the rectory every night about twelve
o'clock and spend an hour in prayer.
On the vigils of great festivals, their
devotions lasted two or three hours.
On these nights, and also on Fridays
and every night in Lent, the whole
party used the discipline, each in
turn receiving it from the others.</p>

<p>These devotional practices seem to
have excited the powers of darkness;
for it is related that many times while
the brotherhood were assembled, mysterious
disturbances were heard, often
apparently just outside the door of
the oratory. The house was searched
with lights, but nothing was ever
discovered which could account for
the noises.</p>

<p>On Sunday afternoons, the rectory
grounds were thrown open to the parish,
and the clergyman mingled freely
with his flock, while games of foot-ball
and cricket were introduced to
make the gatherings more attractive.
Of course the Sabbatarians were
frightfully scandalized at such proceedings;
but no one could deny that
a great moral improvement was soon
perceptible in the parish, and the
dissenters began to forsake their
chapel to crowd around Mr. Faber's
pulpit. His own austerities were fearful.
He fasted rigorously, often eating
for his dinner nothing more than
a few potatoes and a herring, and in
fact never taking a genuine meal except
on Sunday. He wore a thick
horsehair cord tied in knots about
his waist. Want of food often
brought upon him severe attacks of
sickness, and sometimes he fainted
in the church while reading prayers.
In such matters as these he
seems to have been his own director;
but in other religious practices he
governed himself a great deal by the
advice of Dr. Newman. "I have a
request to make," he writes to Newman
in November, 1844, "which I
cannot any longer refrain from making;
but I shall submit at once to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
<em>No</em>, if you will say it. I want you to
revoke your prohibition, laid on me
last October year, of invoking our
Blessed Lady, the saints and angels.
I do feel somehow weakened for the
want of it, and <em>fancy</em> I should get
strength if I did it."</p>

<p>It was some relief, perhaps, in this
suffering of mind to give utterance to
his Catholic yearnings with his pen,
since he durst not pour out his whole
soul in prayer. He had entered into
a scheme for publishing a series of
lives of the English saints, and written
for it a <i>Life of St. Wilfrid</i>. All
the volumes had caused more or less
irritation; but in the <i>Life of St. Wilfrid</i>
the Catholic tendencies of the
tractarian school were developed
with the utmost freedom&mdash;with so
much freedom that we can hardly
understand how they could have
come from the pen of any man
who was even nominally an Anglican.
His difficulties, however, were
now almost over. In the autumn of
1845, many of his friends were received
into the church. Among
them was Dr. Newman; and then Mr.
Faber hesitated no longer. He put
himself at once into communication
with Dr. Wareing, the vicar apostolic
of the eastern district, not to be
instructed in Catholic doctrine, for
that he knew and believed already;
but to inquire about various minor
points connected with a formal reception
into the church. To abandon
his work at Elton he knew would involve
spiritual injury to many; and
about that he felt at first some scruples.
He asked advice of one whose
counsel he had always followed in
times of perplexity&mdash;we presume Dr.
Newman. "Your own soul," he was
told, "is the only consideration, and
you must save that, because&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," interrupted he, "I have
obeyed you as a Protestant and without
the 'because,' and I don't want
to hear it now."</p>

<p>Another obstacle in his way was
the state of his pecuniary affairs. He
had borrowed a large sum of money
for charitable and other works in his
parish; and if he gave up his living, he
could pay neither principal nor interest.
Was it not his duty to remain
rector of Elton until the debt was
paid? He consulted an Anglican
dignitary of his own party. "Depend
upon it," was the answer, "if
God means you to be a Catholic, he
will not let that stand in the way."
Confident, therefore, that God would
provide, he wrote to acquaint his
friends of his purpose, and had no
sooner dispatched the letters than he
received from a generous anti-Catholic
gentleman, who had heard of his
perplexity, a check for the full amount
of the debt.</p>

<p>He officiated at Elton for the last
time on the 16th of November. At
the evening service he told his people
that the doctrines he had preached to
them, though true, were not those of
the Church of England; he could not,
therefore, remain in her communion,
but must go where truth was to be
found. Then he hastily descended
the pulpit stairs, threw off his surplice,
which he left upon the ground, and
made his way as quickly as possible
through the vestry to the house. For
a few minutes the congregation remained
in blank astonishment. The
church-wardens and some others followed
him to the rectory, and begged
him to remain; he might preach
what he pleased, and they would never
question it. It was a sorrowful interview,
for he loved his flock with
all his heart; but he was firm in his
resolve. The next morning he started
early for Northampton, hoping to
escape observation; but the people
were on the watch at their windows;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
and as he passed through, they waved
their handkerchiefs and cried, "God
bless you, wherever you go." Mr.
Faber was accompanied by Mr. T. F.
Knox, a scholar of Trinity College,
Cambridge, and seven of his parishioners.
They were all admitted into
the church the same evening by Bishop
Wareing, and the next day received
their first communion and the
sacrament of confirmation. "A new
light," wrote Mr. Faber next day,
"seems to be shed on every thing,
and more especially on my past position&mdash;a
light so clear as to surprise
me; and though I am homeless and
unsettled, and as to worldly prospects
considerably bewildered, yet there is
such a repose of conscience as more
than compensates for the intense and
fiery struggle which began on the
Tuesday and only ended on the Monday
morning following."</p>

<p>Owing to various circumstances, a
good many recent converts had settled
at Birmingham, where the church
of St. Chad, under the charge of the
Rev. Mr. Moore, had become a great
centre of Catholic life. Mr. Faber
and his companions went there, Faber
accepting the hospitality of Mr.
Moore, and the others disposing of
themselves in various ways. They
continued, however, to look up to
their former pastor for direction, and
he soon conceived the idea of forming
them into a sort of community.
With the approval of Mr. Moore and
Dr. Wiseman, they took possession
of a small house in Caroline street,
Mr. Faber of course joining them.
No definite rule was drawn up at
first, but their general purpose was to
assist the parochial clergy in visiting
the sick, giving instruction, and similar
duties. Mr. Hutchinson, who
afterward became a member of the
little band, has given an amusing account
of a visit he paid them a few
days after their establishment. Mr.
Faber, terribly scorched, was standing
over the fire stirring a kettle of
pea-soup. There was hardly any furniture
except a long deal table, a
chair, knife, fork, and mug for each
man, some pewter spoons with the
temperance pledge stamped on them,
and a three-legged table, split across
the middle, at which, when he could be
spared from the pea-soup, Mr. Faber
was engaged writing a pamphlet on
the reasons for his conversion. Up-stairs
there were four small rooms,
one used as a chapel, the others as
dormitories. There were no bed-steads;
they all slept on the floor.
Such was the beginning of the
Wilfridian Community, or Brothers
of the Will of God, though they took
no distinguishing name until some
time later. At the commencement
of the new year, the generosity of a
friend enabled Mr. Faber to visit
Italy, where he had reason to think
he could obtain money for the support
of the new community. During
his absence, the brethren found
employment with some of the Catholic
tradesmen in the town, returning
to Caroline street every night. The
distinguished convert was of course
received in Rome with great affection,
especially by the ecclesiastics
who had known him on his former
visit. Cardinal Acton fell upon his
neck and kissed him. The pope
gave him a gracious interview. The
English College offered him a home.
The superior of the Camaldolese at
Florence expressed a great desire to
see him. "He was ill in bed," says
Mr. Faber, "and his bed full of snuff;
he seized my head, buried it in the
snuffy clothes, and kissed me most
unmercifully." There is, in fact, a
good deal of fun now and then in
Mr. Faber's letters. He tells, for instance,
how "the dear old pope" refused
to be angry with the Anglican
Bishop of Gibraltar, who came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Rome to give confirmation, his holiness
saying with a chuckle that "he
really had not been aware hitherto
that Rome was in the diocese of Gibraltar;"
and how, in "a fit of unholy
mirth," the holy father mimicked the
way the English Protestants did homage,
"a familiar nod with their chin,
as if they had swallowed pokers."
He was disappointed in the pecuniary
aid which he had come abroad to
seek, but the journey was productive
of much spiritual comfort and improvement;
and as money was soon
forthcoming from another quarter, he
was enabled to go back to Birmingham
with a light heart, and to set
about the more complete organization
of the community according to a
rule which he had devised during his
absence. Meanwhile, arrangements
had been completed for removal to
more commodious quarters in Birmingham;
and in the course of the year
1846 the brethren moved a second
time to a fine estate at Cheadle,
generously given them by Lord
Shrewsbury. They named it St. Wilfrid's.
Their first work here was to
open a school for boys. Pupils came
in rapidly; but the bigotry of the
neighborhood was aroused, and the
most amazing reports were circulated
about the new institution. A relative
of Mr. Hutchinson (who had joined
the community under the name of
Brother Anthony, Mr. Faber being
styled Brother Wilfrid of the Humanity
of Jesus) sent a Scotch physician
to examine the establishment, and we
suppose to report upon the sanity of
the inmates. The same relative described
Mr. Faber as "an ambitious
villain and a hellish ruler," and declared
that wherever he went in London
"the finger of scorn was pointed
at him." "I am said to have <em>strangled</em>
one of my monks," wrote the
"hellish ruler;" "the story is all over
the land, and is believed. Mrs.
R&mdash;&mdash; came to see me at St. Wilfrid's,
'to see the man;' and glaring
at me in silence like a tigress, she
told Lady Shrewsbury and Lady
Arundel that I was quite capable of
all she heard, and that her faith in it
was established."</p>

<p>Humility had led Mr. Faber to defer
ordination to the priesthood, and
up to this time he had received only
minor orders; but in the Advent season
of 1846 he was raised to the subdeaconship,
and at the end of the following
Lent he was ordained deacon
and priest by Dr. Wiseman at Oscott.
The brothers could now engage much
more effectively in missionary work;
and as, besides having a priest among
them, they received several valuable
converts from time to time, they were
enabled to map out a wide extent of
neglected country into districts, and
devote their days to a systematic
visitation of every house within their
limits. The crowds who came on
Sundays to St. Wilfrid's soon overflowed
the little chapel, and Father
Faber used to preach to them in a
yard near the house, or under the
beech-trees in the garden. It was
not unusual for him also to preach in
the streets, wearing his habit or cassock
and holding a crucifix in his
hand.</p>

<p>In a few months there remained but
one Protestant family in the parish,
and the Protestant church was almost
entirely abandoned! Brother Anthony
Hutchinson wrote, "We have converted
the pew-opener, leaving the
parson only his clerk and two drunken
men." The poor people became
extravagantly fond of "Father Fable,"
as they used to call him; but he
was not held in particular affection
by the Protestant clergy, and sometimes
was unwillingly involved in
what he used to call "fighting and
squabbling with parsons." On one
occasion he was followed into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
room of a sick man by a minister of
the Primitive Methodists, who insisted
on remaining there to hear what was
said in confession, and was with great
difficulty persuaded by the invalid to
leave the house.</p>

<p>It was not only from Protestants,
however, that Father Faber had to
suffer annoyance; his worst troubles
came from those of his own faith.
About the time of his ordination he
had made arrangements for the publication
of a series of lives of the saints,
translated from the Italian and other
foreign languages, and afterward so
widely known as the Oratorian Lives.
A part of the literary work he did
himself, but the most of it he committed
to other hands, having at one
time between sixty and seventy translators
at work under his direction.
The series began with a <i>Life of St.
Philip Neri</i>. It reached a large sale;
but so little familiar were English
readers with the supernatural manifestations
which abound in biographies
of the chosen servants of God
that exception was taken to the work
in various quarters, and when the
<i>Life of St. Rose of Lima</i> appeared,
the opposition became extremely violent.
It was objected that the lives
of foreign saints, however edifying
in their respective countries, were unsuited
to England and unfit for Protestant
eyes. Under the advice of Dr. Newman,
who nevertheless approved of
the work very cordially, the series
was finally suspended. But then a reaction
set in; it was discovered how
much practical good the publications
had done; some of those who had
criticised them most severely retracted
and apologized; and the translations
were resumed under the auspices
of the Oratorians, with whom Father
Faber's community had meanwhile
been consolidated.</p>

<p>Mr. Faber and Mr. Hutchinson,
the only priests in the community at
St. Wilfrid's, were on the eve of taking
their vows when news arrived
that Dr. Newman was coming over
from Rome to establish in England
the Oratory of St. Philip Neri. Father
Faber was at prayer when he
felt suddenly an interior call to join
the new congregation. His final decision
was reached only after a long
interior struggle and a free conference
with Bishop Wiseman. Humanly
speaking, it was a great sacrifice&mdash;perhaps
the greatest Father Faber
ever made. Besides giving up
the infant community to which he
had devoted so much care, and descending
at one step from the position
of superior to that of novice, he
had to tear himself away from a congregation
which was quite as warmly
attached to him as his old flock had
been at Elton, to give up St. Wilfrid's,
and to face the vehement opposition
of his brethren in the community
and the generous friends to whom
he had been indebted for his foundation
at Cheadle. "Giving St. Wilfrid's
up," he wrote, "seems to unroot
one altogether from the earth,
and the future is such a complete
blank that one feels as if one was going
to die." "It is Elton over again,"
only, "in my first spoliation I kept
my books and my Elton children;
now I lose these two." To his surprise,
however, when once his mind
had been made up, the opposition of
the community of St. Wilfrid's suddenly
ceased. They all professed
their willingness to follow him; and
the result was, that the Oratorians
took possession of the whole establishment.
Dr. Newman came to St.
Wilfrid's in February, 1848, and admitted
the entire community to his congregation.
"Father Superior has now
left us," wrote Faber, "all in our
Philippine habits with turndown collars,
like so many good boys brought
in after dinner. Since my admission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
I seem to have lost all attachment to
every thing but obedience; I could
dance and sing all day because I am
so joyous; I hardly know what to
do with myself for very happiness."</p>

<p>It was not thought necessary to
exact from him the full period of
three years' noviceship, so at the end
of six months he was dispensed from
the remainder and appointed master
of novices. In October of the same
year, the whole congregation removed
from Birmingham to St. Wilfrid's;
but Father Faber was not allowed to
remain long in this favorite home;
for in the spring he was sent with five
other fathers, namely Dalgairns, Stanton,
Hutchinson, Knox, and Wells,
and two novices, Messrs. Gordon
and Bowden, to found a new house
in London. At the head of this he
remained until his death, and he
never saw St. Wilfrid's again but
once.</p>

<p>The introduction of a new order
or a new congregation is so common
an event now that we can hardly understand
how bitter was the ill-feeling
aroused by the opening of the London
Oratory in a hired house in
King William street in May, 1849.
It was the first public church which
had been served by a religious community
in that diocese since the old
faith was put under the feet of the
English schism. Bishop Wiseman
was a warm supporter of the Oratorians,
but many of the secular clergy
looked upon them with suspicion,
doubted the discretion of a community
composed entirely of converts,
disapproved of the public wearing
of their habit, and complained that
their peculiar services, with new prayers,
hymns in the vernacular, and a
new style of preaching, were Methodistical,
and ought to be suppressed.
Experience, however, in time showed
the doubters their mistake, and the
diocesan clergy became not only
friends but imitators of the Oratorians.
A great deal of popular animosity
continued to be manifested, especially
during the excitement which followed
the reëstablishment of the English
hierarchy. The walls of London
were placarded, "Down with
the Oratorians," "Don't go to the
Oratory," "Banishment to the Oratorians,"
etc.; the fathers were cursed
in the streets, and even <em>gentlemen</em>
used to shout at them from their carriage-windows.
The government
finally issued a proclamation reviving
an old statute which forbade Roman
Catholic ecclesiastics to wear the
habit of their order, and thenceforth
the Oratorians always appeared in
the streets in secular garb.</p>

<p>Father Faber was doing an immense
amount of labor at this time,
preaching, visiting the sick, giving retreats
and missions, and conducting
special devotions, besides employing
some time in literary occupations;
yet he was almost constantly a sufferer
from disease, and was often obliged
to cease for a while from all work
whatsoever. He had long been subject
to very severe and prostrating
headaches, connected with which is
the following remarkable incident
which we shall give in his own words,
written to the Countess of Arundel
and Surrey on the 2d of December,
1850:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And now I have so many things to tell
you that I hardly know where to begin.
Some time ago, a lady at prayer in our
church thought it was revealed to her that
St. Mary Magdalene of Pazzi wished to
confer some <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">grazia</i> on me in connection
with my headache. Her director gave her
permission to act upon this; whereupon
she wrote to me, begging me when my
headache came on to apply a relic of the
saint to my forehead. Some days elapsed;
I asked Father Francis, my director, for
his leave to do this; as it was a merely temporal
thing, he took some time to consider. I
became ill, and had a night of great pain.
I thought he had forgotten all about it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
that it would be a blameworthy imperfection
in me to remind him of it. The morning
after, he came to confession, and found
me ill in bed; he was going away, but I
knew he was going to say Mass, and so I
made him kneel down by my bedside, while
I put on my stole, and with considerable
pain heard his confession; when he rose, I
gave him the stole, and asked him to hear
my confession, which he did. Afterward
he said, 'Well, now, I think it would be
well to try this relic.' I answered, 'Just
as you please.' I was in great suffering,
and very sick besides. He gave it me, and
walked away to the door to say Mass. I
applied the relic, a piece of her linen, to
my forehead; a sort of fire went into my
head, through every limb down to my feet,
causing me to tremble; before Father Francis
could even reach the door, I sprang up,
crying, 'I am cured, I am quite well!' He
said I looked as white as a sheet; I was
filled with a kind of sacred fear, and an intense
desire to consecrate myself utterly to
God. I got up and dressed, without any
difficulty, or pain, or sickness. This was
on the Wednesday. On the Saturday I
had another headache, but I had not asked
Father Francis's leave about the relic, and
felt I ought to take no steps to get rid of
my cross. In the afternoon he told me I
might apply it. Fathers Philip and Edward
were in the room. I was on my bed; I
took the relic and applied it; there was the
same fire in a less degree, but no cure. I
then said to the saint, 'I only ask it to go
to the novena and benediction.' The cure
was instantaneous; while Father Philip had
such an impression that the saint was in the
room, that he was irresistibly drawn to bow to
her. Well, I said my office; then in an hour
or so came the novena and benediction; and
as soon as I returned to my room, I was
taken so ill again I was obliged to go to
bed. Meanwhile I had totally forgotten
what the others reminded me of afterward,
that two years ago Michael Watts Russell
wrote to me from Florence, and said, 'The
children send their love, and desire me to
say they have just come from the tomb of
St. Mary Magdalene of Pazzi, whom they
have been asking to cure Father Wilfrid's
headache.'</p>

<p>"After all this, I am sure I shall lose my
soul if I do not serve God less lukewarmly;
so please pray for me."</p></blockquote>

<p>God had not given him, however,
the favor of a permanent restoration
to health. He was never well in
London. "I have two vocations,"
he wrote to Father Bowden, "one
for my body and one for my soul;
and they happen to be incompatible,
so the body must do the best it can,
and the soul must rough-ride it for
another sixty years, which is supposed
to be the term of incessant
headache still left me. When you
and I sit toothless together, shaking
our palsied heads at recreation, we
shall look down upon the junior fathers
who have been only thirty or
forty years in the congregation with
an ineffable contempt; and when my
dotage comes on, I shall fancy myself
still novice-master and you a refractory
novice, and I shall trip you
up on your crutches for mortification."
For the sake of his health he
was persuaded to start on a journey
to Palestine; but he fell very sick on
the way, and went no further than
Italy. He reached Naples on the
feast of the Immaculate Conception,
(1851,) and entered the Oratorian
church just as benediction was about
to be given, "which," he says, "was
jolly." In the same letter (to Father
Hutchinson) he writes, "If I
can get one, I will bring one of <i>the
rum things</i> they put on the altar in
Advent and Lent, when flowers are
forbidden; they take my fancy hugely."
He came home far from well
enough to resume his work; but there
was a great deal to be done, and he
never had any mercy on himself.
There was a country house for the
congregation to be built at Sydenham
Hill, and the fine new Oratory
at Brompton to be erected in place
of the little establishment in King
William street, which the community
had long ago outgrown. They took
possession of the Brompton house in
March, 1854. The vast cost of this
great institution had been defrayed
principally from the private means of
the individual members, but there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
had been several donations&mdash;£10,000
toward the purchase of the site
from a lady who wished her gift to
be anonymous; £4000 from the
Earl of Arundel and Surrey; and
£700 collected by a committee for
the erection of the church. The current
expenses of the house were also
defrayed from the pockets of the
fathers, it being a rule of the congregation
that the receipts from their
churches should not contribute in
any way to the support of the house,
and indeed at Brompton the income
of the church did not equal its expenditure.</p>

<p>It was while the Brompton building
was under way that Father Faber
began with his <i>All for Jesus, or the
Easy Ways of Divine Love</i>, that remarkable
series of spiritual works
which made his name so widely
known and loved throughout Europe
and America. <i>All for Jesus</i> appeared
in 1853; <i>Bethlehem</i>, the
eighth and last of the series, was
published in 1860. In the mean
time, he had collected a volume of
his earlier and later poems; completed
his poem of <i>Prince Amadis</i>; published
a collection of his hymns,
many of which have become exceedingly
popular, and finished a great
deal of minor literary work. He
made preparations for other books,
on <i>Calvary</i>, <i>The Holy Ghost</i>, <i>The Fear
of God</i>, and <i>The Immaculate Heart of
Mary</i>, fragments of which appeared
after his death under the title, <i>Notes
on Doctrinal and Spiritual Subjects</i>.
These various writings are too well
known and too fondly esteemed, especially
in the United States, for any
criticism to be called for here, and
we can do nothing better than copy
the just eulogy which Father Bowden
cites from <cite>The Dublin Review</cite>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We know of no one man who has done
more to make the men of his day love God
and aspire to a higher path of the interior
life; and we know no man who so nearly
represents to us the mind and the preaching
of St. Bernard and St. Bernardine of
Siena in the tenderness and beauty with
which he has surrounded the names of Jesus
and Mary."</p></blockquote>

<p>All these exquisite works were
written in the midst of the most awful
physical suffering. "It is plain," he
writes in 1858, "that life can't be
lived at this rate. But my mind is
now like a locomotive that has started
with neither driver nor stoker. I
can think of nothing but being seized,
put on board one of her majesty's
ships of war as compulsory chaplain,
and carried round the world for two
years. If I was on land, I should jib
and come home." Bright's disease
of the kidneys, gout, neuralgia&mdash;a
complication, in fact, of numerous
disorders, left him hardly an hour of
ease, hardly a night of rest. Soon
after Easter, in the year 1863, the
hope of checking his disease or even
notably relieving his sufferings was
finally given up. He seems to have
been conscious of his condition even
before the physicians had pronounced
their opinion. During the month
of April he made one or two short
journeys, but without experiencing
any relief. By the middle of June
he was so much worse that the last
sacraments were administered. On
the 28th&mdash;his forty-ninth birthday&mdash;he
saw all the members of the community,
one by one, recommending
himself to their prayers, and leaving
with each some parting gift. He
rallied a little after this, and was even
well enough to take one or two short
drives, and to enjoy farewell visits
from Cardinal Wiseman, and Dr.
Newman, and many of his other
friends. His mind continued perfectly
clear and calm until some time
in September, when attacks of delirium
became frequent, and the sedatives
which had been used to produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
sleep lost their soothing effect.
He received holy communion daily
up to and including the 24th of that
month. The next day his attendants
were able to put him into bed, which
had not been done since June; he
had passed day and night in his
chair, propped up with pillows. He
now lay quite still, gazing at a large
crucifix, and moving his eyes from
one to another of the five wounds.
When told that his death was near,
he only repeated his favorite exclamation,
"God be praised!" On the
morning of the 26th, Father Rowe
told him that he was going to say
Mass for him. He showed by his
face that he understood what was
said; and just as the Mass must have
ended, he turned his head a little
and opened his eyes with a touching
expression, half of sweetness and half
of surprise. So his spirit passed
away, as if in the act of realizing the
picture which he had drawn in <i>All
for Jesus</i>: "Only serve Jesus out
of love, and while your eyes are yet
unclosed what an unspeakable surprise
will you have had at the judgment-seat
of your dearest Love, while
the songs of heaven are breaking on
your ears and the glory of God is
dawning on your eyes, to fade away
no more for ever!"</p>

<p>We have already alluded in the
first part of this article to Father Faber's
elegance of appearance and
manner, and from a portrait prefixed
to the biography it seems that he retained
his advantages of person to a
late period of his life. He was remarkable
for his habits of order and
neatness, and once, when a father remarked
upon the tidiness of his room,
he replied, "The napkin in the sepulchre
was found <em>folded</em> at the resurrection."
As might be imagined from
the narrative of his life, he was always
distinguished for gentleness;
and Father Bowden remarks that he
never was severe in the manner of
correcting the faults of his spiritual
subjects, except possibly in matters
connected with the ceremonial of
divine worship. Any defect of demeanor
during service, or inattention
to the requirements of the rubric, he
rebuked with marked severity. In
the church he would have every thing
of the best, whether it could be seen
by the congregation or not. When
the new high altar of marble was put
up in the Oratory, he was much dissatisfied
because the back was not
finished like the front, and he found
fault with the altar rails for the same
reason, complaining that "the side
next our Lord" was not ornamented.
He was very fond of children, and his
correspondence contains some striking
evidences of his tenderness to them.
We have already spoken of his love
of humor&mdash;a sense which seems naturally
to accompany the poetic instinct.
His room was at all hours
the frequent resort of his brethren
who looked upon it as a renewal
of St. Philip's "School of Christian
Mirth." Father Bowden quotes the
language of an old friend, who wrote
at the time of Father Faber's death
of "the indescribable charm of his
private intercourse, of that wonderful
brilliancy of conversation in which
he excelled all those whose social
powers have made them the idols of
London society as far as they have
excelled ordinary men, of the magic
play of his countenance and of his
voice, of the unprecedented combination
of tenderness in affection, unearthliness
of aim, and worldly wisdom,
which characterized his private
intercourse, and of his power of attracting
little children and learned
men, one as much as the other."</p>

<p>Father Bowden has told the story
of this beautiful life with appreciation
and affection, and with no mean literary
ability. His style is direct and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
unaffected, and he is not given to
the superfluity of pious reflection
with which the biographers of religious
men are so apt to retard their
narratives. The volume contains a
very copious selection from Father
Faber's private correspondence, so
that it may be considered in many
portions virtually an autobiography.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.<br />

THE PROGRESSIVE PROFESSOR.</h3>

<p>When Frank returned from the
walk, he found a visitor at Frankenhöhe.</p>

<p>The visitor was an elegantly-dressed
young man with a free, self-important
air about him.</p>

<p>He spoke fluently, and his words
sounded as decisive as though they
came from the lips of infallibility.
At times this self-importance was of
such a boastful and arrogant character
as to affect the observer disagreeably.</p>

<p>"It is now vacation, and I do not
know how to enjoy it better than by
a visit to you," said he.</p>

<p>"Very flattering to me," answered
Frank. "I hope you will be pleased
with Frankenhöhe."</p>

<p>"Pleased?" returned the visitor as
he looked through the open window
at the beautiful landscape. "I would
like to dream away here the whole
of May and June. How charming it
is! An empire of flowers and vernal
delights."</p>

<p>"I am surprised, Carl, that you
have preserved such a love for nature.
I thought you considered the
professor's chair the culminating point
of attraction."</p>

<p>Carl bowed his head proudly and
stood with folded arms before the
smiling Frank.</p>

<p>"That is evidently intended for
flattery," said he. "The professor's
chair is my vocation. He who does
not hold his vocation as the acme of
all attraction is indeed a perfect man.
Besides, it will appear to you, who
consider every thing in the world&mdash;not
excepting even the fair sex&mdash;with
blank stoicism; it will appear even
to you that the rostrum is destined
to accomplish great things. Ripe
knowledge in mighty pulsations goes
forth from the rostrum and permeates
society. The rostrum governs
and educates the rising young men
who are destined to assume leading
positions in the state. The rostrum
overthrows antiquated forms of religious
delusion, ennobles rational
thought, exact science, and deep investigation.
The rostrum governs
even the throne; for we have princes
in Germany who esteem liberty of
thought and progress of knowledge
more than the art of governing their
people in a spirit of stupidity."</p>

<p>Frank smiled.</p>

<p>"The glory of the rostrum I leave
undisputed," said he. "But I beg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
of you to conceal from the doctor
your scientific rule of faith. You
may get into trouble with the doctor."</p>

<p>"I am very desirous of becoming
acquainted with this paragon of learning&mdash;you
have told me so much about
him; and I confess it was partly to
see him that I made this visit. Get
into trouble? I do not fear the old
syllogism-chopper in the least. A
good disputation with him is even
desirable."</p>

<p>"Well, you are forewarned. If
you go home with a lacerated back,
it will not be my fault."</p>

<p>"A lacerated back?" said the professor
quietly. "Does the doctor
like to use <em>striking</em> arguments?"</p>

<p>"Oh! no. But his sarcasm is as cutting
as the slash of a sword, and his
logical vehemence is like the stroke
of a club."</p>

<p>"We will fight him with the same
weapons," answered Carl, throwing
back his head. "Shall I pay him my
respects immediately?"</p>

<p>"The doctor admits no one. In
his studio he is as inaccessible as a
Turkish sultan in his harem. I will
introduce you in the dining-room, as
it is now just dinner-time."</p>

<p>They betook themselves to the dining-room,
and soon after they heard
the sound of a bell.</p>

<p>"He is just now called to table,"
said Richard. "He does not allow
the servant to enter his room, and for
that reason a bell has been hung
there."</p>

<p>"How particular he is!" said the
professor.</p>

<p>A door of the ante-room was opened,
quick steps were heard, and Klingenberg
hastily entered and placed
himself at the table, as at a work that
must be done quickly, and then observed
the stranger.</p>

<p>"Doctor Lutz, professor of history
in our university," said Frank, introducing
him.</p>

<p>"Doctor Lutz&mdash;professor of history,"
said Klingenberg musingly.
"Your name is familiar to me, if I am
not mistaken; are you not a collaborator
on Sybel's historical publication?"</p>

<p>"I have that honor," answered the
professor with much dignity.</p>

<p>They began to eat.</p>

<p>"You read Sybel's periodical?"
asked the professor.</p>

<p>"We must not remain entirely ignorant
of literary productions, particularly
the more excellent."</p>

<p>Lutz felt much flattered by this
declaration.</p>

<p>"Sybel's periodical is an unavoidable
necessity at present," said the
professor. "Historical research was
in a bad way; it threatened to succumb
entirely to the ultramontane
cause and the clerical party."</p>

<p>"Now Sybel and his co-laborers
will avert that danger," said the doctor.
"These men will do honor to historical
research. The ultramontanists
have a great respect for Sybel. When
he taught in Munich, they did not
rest till he turned his back on Isar-Athen.
In my opinion, Sybel should
not have gone to Munich. The stupid
Bavarians will not allow themselves
to be enlightened. So let them
sit in darkness, the stupid barbarians
who have no appreciation for the progress
of science."</p>

<p>The professor looked astonished.
He could not understand how an admirer
of Sybel's could be so prejudiced.
Frank was alarmed lest the professor
might perceive the doctor's keen
sarcasm&mdash;which he delivered with a
serious countenance&mdash;and feel offended.
He changed the conversation to
another subject, in which Klingenberg
did not take part.</p>

<p>"You have represented the doctor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
incorrectly," said the professor, after
the meal. "He understands Sybel
and praises his efforts&mdash;the best sign
of a clear mind."</p>

<p>"Klingenberg is always just," returned
Frank.</p>

<p>On the following afternoon, Lutz
joined in the accustomed walk. As
they were passing through the chestnut
grove, a servant of Siegwart's
came up breathless, with a letter in
his hand, which he gave to Frank.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said Frank after
reading the letter, "I am urgently requested
to visit Herr Siegwart immediately.
With your permission I will
go."</p>

<p>"Of course, go," said Klingenberg.
"I know," he added with a roguish
expression, "that you would as lief
visit that excellent man as walk with
us."</p>

<p>Richard went off in such haste
that the question occurred to him
why he fulfilled with such zeal the
wishes of a man with whom he had
been so short a time acquainted; but
with the question Angela came before
his mind as an answer. He rejected
this answer, even against his
feelings, and declared to himself that
Siegwart's honorable character and
neighborly feeling made his haste
natural and even obligatory. The
proprietor may have been waiting his
arrival, for he came out to meet him.
Frank observed a dark cloud over
the countenance of the man and
great anxiety in his features.</p>

<p>"I beg your forgiveness a thousand
times, Herr Frank. I know you go
walking with Herr Klingenberg at
this hour, and I have deprived you
of that pleasure."</p>

<p>"No excuse, neighbor. It is a
question which would give me greater
pleasure, to serve you or to walk
with Klingenberg."</p>

<p>Richard smiled while saying these
words; but the smile died away, for he
saw how pale and suddenly anxious
Siegwart had become. They had
entered a room, and he desired to
know the cause of Siegwart's changed
manner.</p>

<p>"A great and afflicting misfortune
threatens us," began the proprietor.
"My Eliza has been suddenly taken
ill, and I have great fears for her
young life. Oh! if you knew how
that child has grown into my heart."
He paused for a moment and suppressed
his grief, but he could not
hide from Frank the tears that filled
his eyes. Richard saw these tears,
and this paternal grief increased his
respect for Siegwart.</p>

<p>"The delicate life of a young child
does not allow of protracted medical
treatment, of consultation or investigation
into the disease or the best
remedies. The disease must be known
immediately and efficient remedies
applied. There are physicians at my
command, but I do not dare to trust
Eliza to them."</p>

<p>"I presume, Herr Siegwart, that
you wish for Klingenberg."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and through your mediation.
You know that he only treats
the sick poor; but resolutely refuses
his services to the wealthy."</p>

<p>"Do not be uneasy about that. I
hope to be able to induce Klingenberg
to correspond with your wishes.
But is Eliza really so sick, or does
your apprehension increase your anxiety?"</p>

<p>"I will show you the child, and
then you can judge for yourself."
They went up-stairs and quietly entered
the sick-room. Angela sat on
the little bed of the child, reading.
The child was asleep, but the noise
of their entrance awoke her. She
reached out her little round arms to
her father, and said in a scarcely audible
whisper,</p>

<p>"Papa&mdash;papa!"</p>

<p>This whispered "papa" seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
pierce the soul of Siegwart like a
knife. He drew near and leant over
the child.</p>

<p>"You will be well to-morrow, my
sweet pet. Do you see, Herr Frank
has come to see you?"</p>

<p>"Mamma!" whispered the child.</p>

<p>"Your mother will come to-morrow,
my Eliza. She will bring you
something pretty. My wife has been
for the last two weeks at her sister's,
who lives a few miles from here,"
said Siegwart, turning to Frank. "I
sent a messenger for her early this
morning."</p>

<p>While the father sat on the bed
and held Eliza's hand in his, Frank
observed Angela, who scarcely turned
her eyes from the sick child. Her
whole soul seemed taken up with her
suffering sister. Only once had she
looked inquiringly at Frank, to read
in his face his opinion of the condition
of Eliza. She stood immovable
at the foot of the bed, as mild, as
pure, and as beautiful as the guardian
angel of the child.</p>

<p>Both men left the room.</p>

<p>"I will immediately seek the doctor,
who is now on his walk," said
Frank.</p>

<p>"Shall I send my servant for
him?"</p>

<p>"That is unnecessary," returned
Frank. "And even if your servant
should find the doctor, he would probably
not be inclined to shorten his
walk. Our gardener, who works in
the chestnut grove, will show me the
way the doctor took. In an hour
and a half at furthest I will be back."</p>

<p>The young man pressed the outstretched
hand of Siegwart, and hastened
away.</p>

<p>In the mean time the doctor and
the professor had reached a narrow,
wooded ravine, on both sides of
which the rocks rose almost perpendicularly.
The path on which they
walked passed near a little brook,
that flowed rippling over the pebbles
in its bed. The branches of the
young beeches formed a green roof
over the path, and only here and
there were a few openings through
which the sun shot its sloping beams
across the cool, dusky way, and in
the sunbeams floated and danced
dust-colored insects and buzzing flies.</p>

<p>The learned saunterers continued
their amusement without altercation
until the professor's presumption offended
the doctor and led to a vehement
dispute.</p>

<p>Klingenberg did not appear on the
stage of publicity. He left boasting
and self-praise to others, far
inferior to him in knowledge. He
despised that tendency which pursues
knowledge only to command,
which cries down any inquiry that
clashes with their theories. The doctor
published no learned work, nor
did he write for the periodicals, to
defend his views. But if he happened
to meet a scientific opponent, he
fought him with sharp, cutting weapons.</p>

<p>"I do not doubt of the final victory
of true science over the falsifying
party spirit of the ultramontanes,"
said the professor. "Sybel's periodical
destroys, year by year, more and
more the crumbling edifice which
the clerical zealots build on the untenable
foundation of falsified facts."</p>

<p>Klingenberg tore his cap from his
head and swung it about vehemently,
and made such long strides that the
other with difficulty kept up with
him. Suddenly he stopped, turned
about, and looked the professor sharply
in the eyes.</p>

<p>"You praise Sybel's publication
unjustly," said he excitedly. "It is
true Sybel has founded a historical
school, and has won many imitators;
but his is a school destructive of
morality and of history&mdash;a school of
scientific radicalism, a school of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
falsehood and deceitfulness. Sybel
and his followers undertake to mould
and distort history to their purposes.
They slur over every thing that contradicts
their theories. To them the
ultramontanes are partial, prejudiced
men&mdash;or perhaps asses and dunces;
you are unfortunately right when
you say Sybel's school wins ground;
for Sybel and his fellows have brought
lying and falsification to perfection.
They have in Germany perplexed
minds, and have brought their historical
falsifications to market as true
ware."</p>

<p>The professor could scarcely believe
his own ears.</p>

<p>"I have given you freely and
openly my judgment, which need not
offend you, as it refers to principles,
not persons."</p>

<p>"Not in the least," answered Lutz
derisively. "I admit with pleasure
that Sybel's school is anti-church, and
even anti-Christian, if you will. There
is no honor in denying this. The
denial would be of no use; for this
spirit speaks too loudly and clearly in
that school. Sybel and his associates
keep up with the enlightenment
and liberalism of our times. But I
must contradict you when you say
this free tendency is injurious to society;
the seed of free inquiry and
human enlightenment can bring forth
only good fruits."</p>

<p>"Oh! we know this fruit of the
new heathenism," cried the doctor.
"There is no deed so dark, no crime
so great, that it may not be defended
according to the anti-Christian principles
of vicious enlightenment and
corrupt civilization. Sybel's school
proves this with striking clearness.
Tyrants are praised and honored.
Noble men are defamed and covered
with dirt."</p>

<p>"This you assert, doctor; it is impossible
to prove such a declaration."</p>

<p>"Impossible! Not at all. Sybel's
periodical exalts to the seventh heaven
the tyrant Henry VIII. of England.
You extol him as a conscientious
man who was compelled by
scruples of conscience to separate
from his wife. You commend him
for having but one mistress. You
say that the sensualities of princes
are only of 'anecdotal interest.'
Naturally," added the doctor contemptuously,
"a school that cuts loose
from Christian principles cannot consistently
condemn adultery. Fie! fie!
Debauchees and men of gross sensuality
might sit in Sybel's enlightened
school. Progress overthrows the
cross, and erects the crescent. We
may yet live to see every wealthy
man of the new enlightenment have
his harem. Whether society can
withstand the detestable consequences
of this teaching of licentiousness
and contempt for Christian morality,
is a consideration on which these
progressive gentlemen do not reflect."</p>

<p>"I admit, doctor," said Lutz,
"that the clear light of free, impartial
science must needs hurt the eyes of
a pious believer. According to the
opinions of the ultramontanes, Henry
VIII. was a terrible tyrant and blood-hound.
Sybel's periodical deserves
the credit of having done justice to
that great king."</p>

<p>"Do you say so?" cried the doctor,
with flaming eyes. "You, a professor
of history in the university!
You, who are appointed to teach our
young men the truth! Shame on you!
What you say is nothing but stark
hypocrisy. I appeal to the heathen.
You may consider religion from the
stand-point of an ape, for what I care;
your cynicism, which is not ashamed
to equalize itself with the brute, may
also pass. But this hypocrisy, this
fallacious representation of historical
facts and persons, this hypocrisy before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
my eyes&mdash;this I cannot stand;
this must be corrected."</p>

<p>The doctor actually doubled up
his fists. Lutz saw it and saw also
the wild fire in the eyes of his opponent,
and was filled with apprehension
and anxiety.</p>

<p>Erect and silent, fiery indignation
in his flushed countenance, stood
Klingenberg before the frightened
professor. As Lutz still held his
tongue, the doctor continued,</p>

<p>"You call Henry VIII. a 'great
king,' you extol and defend this
'great king' in Sybel's periodical.
I say Henry VIII. was a great
scoundrel, a blackguard without a
conscience, and a bloodthirsty tyrant.
I prove my assertion. Henry VIII.
caused to be executed two queens
who were his wives&mdash;two cardinals,
twelve dukes and marquises, eighteen
barons and knights, seventy-seven
abbots and priors, and over
sixty thousand Catholics. Why did
he have them executed? Because
they were criminals? No; because
they remained true to their consciences
and to the religion of their fathers.
All these fell victims to the
cruelty of Henry VIII., whom you
style a 'great king.' You glorify a
man who for blood-thirstiness and
cruelty can be placed by the side
of Nero and Diocletian. That is
my retort to your hypocrisy and
historical mendacity."</p>

<p>The stern doctor having emptied
his vials of wrath, now walked on
quietly; Lutz with drooping head
followed in silence.</p>

<p>"Sybel does not even stop with
Henry VIII.," again began the doctor.
"These enlightened gentlemen
undertake to glorify even Tiberius,
that inhuman monster. They might
as well have the impudence to glorify
cruelty itself. On the other hand, truly
great men, such as Tilly, are abandoned
to the hatred of the ignorant."</p>

<p>"This is unjust," said the professor
hastily. "Sybel's periodical in the
second volume says that Tilly was
often calumniated by party spirit;
that the destruction of Magdeburg
belongs to the class of unproved
and improbable events. The periodical
proves that Tilly's conduct
in North Germany was mild and
humane, that he signalized himself
by his simplicity, unselfishness, and
conscientiousness."</p>

<p>"Does Sybel's periodical say all
this?"</p>

<p>"Word for word, and much more
in praise of that magnanimous man,"
said Lutz. "From this you may
know that science is just even to
pious heroes."</p>

<p>Klingenberg smiled characteristically,
and in his smile was an expression
of ineffable contempt.</p>

<p>He stopped before the professor.</p>

<p>"You have just quoted what impartial
historical research informs us
of Tilly, in the second and third volumes.
It is so. I remember perfectly
having read that favorable account.
Now let me quote what the
same periodical says of the same
Tilly in the seventeenth volume. There
we read that Tilly was a hypocrite
and a blood-hound, whose name
cannot be mentioned without a shudder;
furthermore, we are told that Tilly
burned Magdeburg, that he waged
a ravaging war against men, women,
children, and property. You see,
then, in the second and third volumes
that Tilly was a conscientious,
mild man and pious hero; in the seventeenth
volume, that he was a tyrant
and blood-hound. It appears from
this with striking clearness that the
enlightened progressionists do not
stick at contradiction, mendacity, and
defamation."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>The professor lowered his eyes and
stood embarrassed.</p>

<p>"I leave you, 'Herr Professor,' to
give a name to such a procedure.
Besides, I must also observe that
the strictly scientific method, as it labels
itself at present, does not stop at
personal defamation. As every holy
delusion and religious superstition
must be destroyed in the hearts of
the students, this lying and defamation
extends to the historical truths
of faith. It is taught from the professors'
chairs, and confirmed by the
scientific journals, that confession is
an invention of the middle ages; while
you must know from thorough research
that confession has existed up
to the time of the apostles. You
teach and write that Innocent III.
introduced the doctrine of transubstantiation
in the thirteenth century;
while every one having the least
knowledge of history knows that at
the council of 1215 it was only
made a duty to receive the holy communion
at Easter, that the fathers
of the first ages speak of transubstantiation&mdash;that
it has its foundation in
Scripture. You know as well as I do
that indulgences were imparted even
in the first century: but this does not
prevent you from teaching that the
popes of the middle ages invented
indulgences from love of money, and
sold them from avarice. Thus the
progressive science lies and defames,
yet is not ashamed to raise high the
banner of enlightenment; thus you
lead people into error, and destroy
youth. Fie! fie!"</p>

<p>The doctor turned and was about
to proceed when he heard his name
called. Frank hastened to him, the
perspiration running from his forehead,
and his breast heaving from
rapid breathing. In a few words he
made known Eliza's illness, and Siegwart's
request.</p>

<p>"You know," said Klingenberg,
"that I treat only the poor, who cannot
easily get a physician."</p>

<p>"Make an exception in this case,
doctor, I beg of you most earnestly!
You respect Siegwart yourself
for his integrity, and I also of late
have learned to esteem the excellent
man, whose heart at present is rent
with anxiety and distress. Save this
child, doctor; I beg of you save it."</p>

<p>Klingenberg saw the young man's
anxiety and goodness, and benevolence
beamed on his still angry face.</p>

<p>"I see," said he, "that no refusal
is to be thought of. Well, we will
go." And he immediately set off
with long strides on his way back.
Richard cast a glance at the professor,
who followed, gloomy and spiteful.
He saw the angry look he now
and then turned on the hastening
doctor, and knew that a sharp contest
must have taken place. But his solicitude
for Siegwart's child excluded all
other sympathy. On the way he exchanged
only a few words with Lutz,
who moved on morosely, and was
glad when Klingenberg and Richard
separated from him in the vicinity of
Frankenhöhe.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later they entered the
house of Siegwart. The doctor
stood for a moment observing the
child without touching it. The little
one opened her eyes, and appeared
to be frightened at the strange man
with the sharp features. Siegwart
and Angela read anxiously in the
doctor's immovable countenance.
As Eliza said "Papa," in a peculiar,
feverish tone, Klingenberg moved
away from the bed. He cast a
quick glance at the father, went to
the window and drummed with his
fingers on the glass. Frank read in
that quick glance that Eliza must
die. Angela must also have guessed
the doctor's opinion, for she was very
much affected; her head sank on her
breast and tears burst from her eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>Klingenberg took out his note-book,
wrote something on a small
slip of paper, and ordered the recipe
to be taken immediately to the apothecary.
He then took his departure.</p>

<p>"What do you think of the child?"
said Siegwart, as they passed over
the yard.</p>

<p>"The child is very sick; send for
me in the morning if it be necessary."</p>

<p>Frank and the doctor went some
distance in silence. The young man
thought of the misery the death of
Eliza would bring on that happy
family, and the pale, suffering Angela
in particular stood before him.</p>

<p>"Is recovery not possible?"</p>

<p>"No. The child will surely die to-night.
I prescribed only a soothing
remedy. I am sorry for Siegwart; he
is one of the few fathers who hang
with boundless love on their children&mdash;particularly
when they are young.
The man must call forth all his
strength to bear up against it."</p>

<p>When Frank entered his room, he
found Lutz in a very bad humor.</p>

<p>"You have judged that old bear
much too leniently," began the professor.
"The man is a model of
coarseness and intolerable bigotry."</p>

<p>"I thought so," said Frank. "I
know you and I know the doctor;
and I knew two such rugged antitheses
must affect each other unpleasantly.
What occasioned your dispute?"</p>

<p>"What! A thousand things," answered
his friend ill-humoredly.
"The old rhinoceros has not the
least appreciation of true knowledge.
He carries haughtily the long wig of
antiquated stupidity, and does not
see the shallowness of the swamp in
which he wallows. The genius of
Christianity is to him the sublime.
Where this stops, pernicious enlightenment&mdash;which
corrupts the people,
turns churches into ball-rooms, and
the Bible into a book of fables&mdash;begins."</p>

<p>"The doctor is not wrong there,"
said Frank earnestly. "Are they not
endeavoring with all their strength
to deprive the Bible of its divine
character? Does not one Schenkel
in Heidelberg deny the divinity
of Christ? Is not this Schenkel the
director of a theological faculty?
Do not some Catholic professors
even begin to dogmatize and dispute
the authority of the holy see?"</p>

<p>"We rejoice at the consoling fact
that Catholic <i>savants</i> themselves
break the fetters with which Rome's
infallibility has bound in adamantine
chains the human mind!" cried
Lutz with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"It appears strange to me when
young men&mdash;scarcely escaped from
the school, and boasting of all modern
knowledge&mdash;cast aside as old,
worthless rubbish what great minds
of past ages have deeply pondered.
The see of Rome and its dogmas
have ruled the world for eighteen
hundred years. Rome's dogmas
overthrew the old world and created
a new one. They have withstood
and survived storms that have engulfed
all else besides. Such strength
excites wonder and admiration, but
not contempt."</p>

<p>"I let your eulogy on Rome pass,"
said the professor. "But as Rome
and her dogmas have overthrown
heathenism, so will the irresistible progress
of science overthrow Christianity.
Coming generations will smile
as complacently at the God of Christendom
as we consider with astonishment
the great and small gods of the
heathen."</p>

<p>"I do not desire the realization
of your prophecy," said Frank
gloomily; "for it must be accompanied
by convulsions that will transform
the whole world, and therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
I do not like to see an anti-Christian
tendency pervading science."</p>

<p>"Tendency, tendency!" said Lutz,
hesitating. "In science there is no
tendency; there is but truth."</p>

<p>"Easy, friend, easy! Be candid
and just. You will not deny that
the tendency of Sybel's school is to
war against the church?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, in so far as the church
contends against truth and thorough
investigation."</p>

<p>"Good; and the friends of the
church will contend against you in so
far as you are inimical to the spirit of
the church. And so, tendency on
one side, tendency on the other. But
it is you who make the more noise.
As soon as a book opposed to you
appears,&mdash;'Partial!' you say with contemptuous
mien; 'Odious!' 'Ecclesiastical!'
'Unreadable!' and it is
forthwith condemned. But it appears
to me natural that a man should labor
and write in a cause which is to him
the noblest cause."</p>

<p>"I am astonished, Richard! You
did not think formerly as you now
do. But I should not be surprised
if your intercourse with the
doctor is not without its effects."
This the professor said in a cutting
tone. Frank turned about and walked
the room. The observation of
his friend annoyed him, and he reflected
whether his views had actually
undergone any change.</p>

<p>"You deceive yourself. I am still
the same," said he. "You cannot
mistrust me because I do not take
part with you against the doctor."</p>

<p>Carl sat for a time thinking.</p>

<p>"Is my presence at the table necessary?"
said he. "I do not wish
to meet the doctor again."</p>

<p>"That would be little in you.
You must not avoid the doctor.
You must convince yourself that he
does not bear any ill-will on account
of that scientific dispute. With all
his rough bluntness, Klingenberg is a
noble man. Your non-appearance
at table must offend him, and at the
same time betray your annoyance."</p>

<p>"I obey," answered Lutz. "To-morrow
I will go for a few days to
the mountains. On my return I will
remain another day with you."</p>

<p>Frank's assurance was confirmed.
The doctor met the guest as if nothing
unpleasant had happened. In
the cool of the evening he went with
the young men into the garden, and
spoke with such familiarity of Tacitus,
Livy, and other historians of antiquity
that the professor admired his
erudition.</p>

<p>Frank wrote in his diary:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"May 20th.&mdash;After mature reflection, I
find that the views which I believed to be
strongly founded begin to totter. What
would the professor say if he knew that not
the doctor, but a country family, and that,
too, ultramontane, begin to shake the foundation
of my views? Would he not call
me weak?"</p></blockquote>

<p>He laid down the pen and sat sullenly
reflecting.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"All my impressions of the ultramontane
family be herewith effaced," he wrote further.
"The only fact I admit is, that even
ultramontanes also can be good people.
But this fact shall in no wise destroy my
former convictions."</p></blockquote>

<h2>THE COUNCIL AND THE ROMAN CONGREGATIONS.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></h2>


<p>The Council of Trent was the
eighteenth general council, and terminated
its sessions in the year 1562.
None had preceded it for upward
of a century, and during the three
hundred years which have since
elapsed the church has failed to witness
one of these august assemblies.</p>

<p>Hence it has been objected that,
since the sixteenth century, the safeguards
of truth and liberty have been
diminished, and that the absence, in
modern times, of those councils,
which were so frequent during the
first ages, manifests an intention on
the part of the popes to exercise
their authority with the utmost rigor,
and to govern alone, without the assistance
of those lights to which their
predecessors did not deem it humiliating
to appeal.</p>

<p>This imputation is, however, contrary
to the truth. During the first
three centuries there was no general
council. Since then, as all admit,
the sovereign pontiffs have had the
sole right to summon these assemblies,
and have been the sole judges
as to when this should be done.
This power was conferred upon them
with the especial design that they might
use it without incurring any blame
from those who never were made
their judges. In the exercise of it
they are influenced by reasons which
we cannot estimate. They know
better than any one else the wants of
the church, the condition of the
world, the inconveniences, the obstacles,
and the dangers which oppose
such an assemblage. Possibly, also,
they perceive in history certain reasons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
which modify their action. In
modern times the secular power loves
to meddle with the affairs of the
church. It desires to make religion
a handmaid of politics, and, thoroughly
enamored of its own independence,
it would sink to the lowest
limit the freedom of the church.
Its manifest impiety, its sceptical
principles, which, under the names of
toleration and liberty of conscience,
have penetrated its governments,
have rendered its interference far
more disastrous in modern times
than at any former period in history.
The kings of the middle ages did indeed
wish to make the church serve
their own ends, but they, at least, were
in their turn faithful to her. They
held fast to her dogmas, and submitted
humbly to her discipline. Their
combination was to rule, not to overthrow
and destroy. But such is not
the temper of these modern governments,
all or nearly all of which seek
to hold religion itself in subjection.
For this purpose they establish national
churches, which are attached
to the universal church by a tie which
may easily at any time be broken.
They exalt the authority of bishops,
that thereby they may diminish that
of popes. They exhibit a desire to
lodge the government of the church
in councils, and to use these assemblies
for the introduction of extensive
modifications into ecclesiastical law.
The councils of Basle and Constance
showed indications of these projects,
and it was through no fault of the secular
power that the Council of Trent
did not realize them.</p>

<p>Thus also is explained the laudable
design of the sovereign pontiffs in
contending against these disastrous
tendencies, and in showing to the
world, by long experience, that the
fundamental power in the church
rests with them. They have wished
to remove from princes the means
upon which they had so often relied
for the overthrow of ecclesiastical
authority. This is the reason why
the popes, during the last three centuries,
have convoked no council, but
have sought from different institutions
such assistance as they have required.</p>

<p>It is for the purpose of affording
this assistance that the Roman congregations
have been established.
Their origin may be found in those
consistories of cardinals which, from
the ninth to the sixteenth centuries,
constituted the permanent senate of
the pontiff, and assembled twice or
thrice a week in his palace, to consider
measures for the reformation of
both clergy and people, to receive the
complaints of all classes of the faithful,
and to decide the controversies
and disputes of the entire world.
These consistories were themselves
the offspring of those Roman councils
which were so frequent during the
first ten ages of the church; for it may
be well remarked that the church,
though based upon the supreme authority
of the popes, has never neglected
those human institutions
which could increase its influence or
lighten the labors of its head. Its
principles have always been the same,
but it has suited the method of their
application to the necessities of each
succeeding age.</p>

<p>Like the councils, the consistories
were composed of men renowned for
their faith, their learning, and their
sanctity. The sovereign pontiffs
continually added to the college of
cardinals the most illustrious of the
clergy, and called to Rome, from all
quarters of the globe, those religious,
those ecclesiastics, and those prelates
whose assistance they deemed most
useful in the government of the
church. These men were absolutely
independent of the secular power, and
totally secluded from its influence.
Living in constant intercourse with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the pontiff himself, they enjoyed all
necessary liberty; they exercised for
life the powers confided to them;
they had no worldly care or fear, and
they enjoyed a rank from which they
could not be deposed. They spent
their time in prayer, in charitable
works, in the study of sacred literature,
and in the discharge of their
duties. Where could be found more
intelligence, greater learning, or more
ample guarantees for the preservation
of truth?</p>

<p>The principle of the church, that
her power, though essentially resident
in the person of one, should be
disseminated through the instrumentality
of many, is applicable to all
degrees of the ecclesiastical hierarchy.</p>

<p>Thus, the bishop and his chapter
are considered as forming but one
body, while yet the decretal <i>novit</i>
of Alexander III. secures to bishops
the management of their own
churches without the consent or co-operation
of their brethren. Thus,
also, the popes have near them a
body of cardinals, an illustrious senate,
composed of the most learned
and holy men of the whole world,
who assist them in the direction of
the church. This senate, collected
in one assemblage under the presidency
of the pontiff, forms the consistory,
at whose sessions the most
important causes are frequently determined.</p>

<p>The extension of the faith, the
multiplicity of appeals to the holy
see, the more complicated developments
of modern life, and the increased
entanglements of the church with
the world have, however, rendered
necessary a more frequent intervention
of authority, and added vastly
to the number of those causes on
which the holy see has been obliged
to pronounce judgment.</p>

<p>The government of the church is
by far the most extensive of the governments
of the earth. It is not
bounded by the limits of any particular
kingdom, but reaches throughout
the globe, as well to those countries
whose heathen populations demand
its constant care, as to those Catholic
states which are directly subject to
the jurisdiction of the apostolic see.
From all these places innumerable
cases constantly arrive at Rome,
each of which demands, for its proper
determination, a profound examination.
These are not like cases which
are submitted to the civil tribunals,
in which material interests only are
at stake, and for which a temporary
solution is sufficient. They are questions
of doctrine, which demand an
answer rigorously exact, since these
answers determine faith. They are
questions of administration, which interest
secular institutions, great personages,
often entire provinces and
kingdoms. They are questions of
conscience, upon which depend the
peace and salvation of souls. These
decisions, whatever they may be,
will always be received with an unqualified
respect and a perfect docility,
which impose upon their authors
an obligation to exercise the utmost
care. And yet it is also necessary
to judge quickly, for the affairs are
often of a vital importance which will
not brook delay.</p>

<p>It would be, of course, impossible
for the sovereign pontiff to examine
personally all these various matters,
and to decide upon them in a single
assembly. Hence the college of cardinals
has been divided into a certain
number of sections, to each of
which pertains the examination of
some particular class of cases. This
division did not take place all at
once. It grew into existence by the
successive erection of different congregations
instituted as fast and in
such proportions as necessity seemed
to require.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>That which is especially remarkable
about these institutions is the
protection which they give to private
interests, since the submission of each
affair to the scrutiny of many persons
is a security for knowledge, independence,
and impartiality in its decision.
Moreover, these institutions
preserve the customs and the character
of an ecclesiastical government.
We have mentioned the relationship
of bishops and their chapters. Every
chapter was subdivided into commissions,
to each of which a separate
part in the administration of the diocese
was assigned. One had the
spiritual and scholastic direction of
the episcopal seminaries; another,
that of the temporalities; and still another,
the examination and reception
of the candidates for the priesthood.
These commissions bear a certain resemblance
to the Roman congregations.
The latter were established
by the voluntary action of the sovereign
pontiffs. The Council of Trent
was not occupied with them. It regulated
diocesan administration as it
believed useful, but it left the administration
of the universal church to
the wisdom of the popes; so that precisely
at the time when its enemies
think they can detect tendencies on
the part of the holy see to absolutism,
the pontiffs without constraint,
but of their own accord, organize
those institutions which are the best
safeguards against the dangers of absolute
power.</p>

<p>In reckoning up the number of
those who, under different titles, take
part in these labors, we discover that
the Roman congregations form an
entire assemblage of five hundred
persons, all illustrious for their piety
and learning. Many councils have
been less numerous. These constitute
a sort of permanent council,
which is in daily communication with
all the churches of the world, and
which, not being limited in duration,
can bring to the questions which are
submitted to it all desirable deliberation.
Perfect order presides over
its labors. Like the councils, it is
divided into sections, to which the
members are assigned according to
their peculiar aptitudes. These sections,
which are the congregations
properly so called, are permanent
also, and consequently are enabled
to devote themselves to the study of
all the branches of ecclesiastical administration
for the purpose of determining
its principles. Finally, like
the councils themselves, they draw
their authority from the sovereign
pontiff, and their decisions are subject
to his approval.</p>

<p>The attributes of these congregations
are manifold and various.
They may be arranged under three
principal heads: administrative, deliberative,
and judicial.</p>

<p>The Roman congregations are the
supreme directors of ecclesiastical
administration. The sovereign pontiff
adopts no measures which affect
the government of dioceses, the communities
of religious, the missions, or
the ceremonies of the ritual; he
grants no faculties or dispensations;
he fills no important position in the
church, until the congregation to
whose sphere the case belongs has
been summoned to consider it. Often,
indeed, the congregation itself
first perceives the necessity to be
provided for. If it be a matter of
small moment, the president or secretary
of the congregation, either by
virtue of his office or by special concession,
will render a decision. If
the matter is of higher consequence,
it is previously submitted to the pope,
and a decision rendered, as it is called,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex audentia summi pontificis</i>. If
it is of the highest character, it will
receive special care and be considered
in a full congregation. In every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
case these acts derive their administrative
power from the authority
given to the sovereign pontiff over
the church. They use this power,
manifesting itself in council, with the
assistance of renowned and holy men
and in a manner worthy of him who
made the world with number, weight,
and measure.</p>

<p>These congregations have also to
resolve the doubts which arise upon
different points of canon law. Sometimes
propositions in the abstract
are submitted to them for the determination
of discipline or ceremonies;
sometimes they consult upon the application
of a general law to some
particular case which does not seem
to come entirely within its provisions.
They occupy in the church the place
of a central light to which every one,
prelate or layman, king or simple citizen,
may come for illumination.
They are not only the adviser of the
sovereign, but of all his subjects.
No institution of the secular power
can be compared to them. He who
has doubts upon the interpretation
of civil law is able to consult its doctors
and professors only in detail.
The council of state has no power
to respond to individuals who interrogate
it; its advice is given only
when the government demands it.
The courts can render only concrete,
particular decisions upon stated cases.
More liberal than the state, the
church holds its wisdom at the disposal
of every conscience. It responds
to all, and, without regard to the dignity
of persons, it investigates with
the same care the questions they
propound; for it always acts for the
salvation of souls, and considers every
soul redeemed by the blood of
Christ as of infinite price.</p>

<p>The method of procedure in these
deliberations shows the care which
the church exercises over every matter
of this nature. The question is
first examined and discussed in a
"consultation;" which document is
referred to all or a portion of the
members, according to the nature of
the affair and the usages of the congregation.
The consultors are advised
with. The question is submitted
to the judgment of eminent cardinals
united in full congregation.
The decision is laid before the pope,
whose approval must be obtained before
its promulgation. Then this decision
becomes an authentic interpretation
of law, not merely on account
of the official authority of the congregation,
but on account of the
approbation of the sovereign pontiff.
It possesses legislative authority
and has the force of law.
Further on we shall see that although
these congregations, being officially
invested by the holy see with the
right of interpreting law, render definitive
decisions which are indisputable
and cannot be raised by any other
authority, yet they are not thereby
to be considered as infallible.
Their judgments are obligatory because
supreme, not because they are
infallible.</p>

<p>Finally, these congregations are
the final tribunals for the determination
of ecclesiastical causes. Sometimes
these causes are brought by
way of appeal from the decrees and
sentences of the ordinaries of different
places. Sometimes the parties
submit directly to their decision
questions never before raised at an
inferior tribunal. All these congregations
possess judicial powers, and
are able to resolve contested cases.
The chief of those to which appeals
are taken are, however, the Congregation
of the Council and the Congregation
of Bishops and Regulars.
The causes thus submitted are both
civil and criminal. The Congregation
of the Holy Office is the supreme
tribunal for the crimes and misdemeanors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
which concern faith, such as
heresy, polygamy, detention of prohibited
books, infraction of fasts, the
celebration of mass, and the administration
of the sacraments by men
who are not priests, the public veneration
of unbeatified dead, and the
superstitions of astrology and false
revelations. The Congregation of
Bishops and Regulars is the ordinary
judge of appeals in those criminal
causes which do not come under the
jurisdiction of the Holy Office. The
Congregation of the Council determines
those cases which are specified
by the Council of Trent.</p>

<p>These congregations, fifteen in
number, are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. The Congregation of the Holy Office,
established by Paul III.</p>

<p>2. The Congregation of the Council, established
by Pius IV.</p>

<p>3. The Congregation of the Index, established
by Leo X.</p>

<p>4 and 5. The Congregation of Bishops
and Regulars, established by Gregory XIII.
and Sixtus V.</p>

<p>6. The Congregation of Rites, established
by Sixtus V.</p>

<p>7. The Congregation of Schools, established
by Sixtus V.</p>

<p>8. The Congregation of the Consistory,
established by Sixtus V.</p>

<p>9. The Congregation of the Examination
of Bishops, established by Clement VIII.</p>

<p>10. The Congregation of the Propaganda,
established by Gregory XV.</p>

<p>11. The Congregation of Ecclesiastical
Immunities, established by Urban VIII.</p>

<p>12. The Congregation of the Residence
of Bishops, established by Clement VIII.
and Benedict XIV.</p>

<p>13. The Congregation of Indulgences, established
by Clement IX.</p>

<p>14. The Congregation of Extraordinary
Affairs, established by Pius VII.</p>

<p>15. The Congregation of Oriental Rites,
established by Pius IX.</p></blockquote>

<p>The first of these congregations,
as well in the order of their importance
as of their origin, is that of the
Holy Office. The principle upon
which it is based, although violently
attacked in our day, is certainly incontestable.
Man has no right to
propagate error; for error is an evil
which causes public disturbance and
disorder, and is especially dangerous
to the ignorant and feeble, of whom
the greater part of mankind is composed.
Civil tribunals and temporal
governments never hesitate to use
this right as one necessary to their
self-preservation. It is not, therefore,
surprising that the church claims it,
since it is a perfect society, and owes
to itself the duty of self-protection.
Rather should it exercise this right
with the most unquestioned authority,
being itself infallible, and able to
discriminate with absolute exactness
between truth and error.</p>

<p>Twenty years before the conclusion
of the Council of Trent, by a
bull dated July 2d, 1542, Pope
Paul III. established the Congregation
of the Holy Office, composed of
six cardinals, for the increase and defence
of the Catholic faith. The
successors of Paul III. confirmed
this congregation and increased the
number of its members. Sixtus V.
solemnly recognized its existence in
1588, in his bull <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Immensa Æterni</i>.
This congregation is usually presided
over by the pope himself.</p>

<p>The Congregation of the Council
was established by Pius IV., in order
to carry into effect the decrees of the
Council of Trent, and received from
Sixtus V. the faculty of interpreting,
with apostolic authority, all the disciplinary
canons of that august assembly.
The Council of Trent was
bound by no precedents in regulating
particular points of discipline. It
reviewed the whole body of canons,
confirming whatever in the former
law ought to be preserved, completing
what was lacking, and publishing
a full code of ecclesiastical discipline.
In spite of the care with which all
these new dispositions had been
made, difficulties soon began to arise
as to their interpretation and application.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
The council had foreseen this,
and left it to the sovereign pontiff to
provide for the necessity. On this
account, the pope instituted a permanent
tribunal, composed, at the outset,
of those cardinals who had assisted
at the council, who understood
its spirit, and knew how best to preserve
and transmit its traditions.
This was the Congregation of the
Council. The religious orders already
possessed an analogous institution.
That of Citeaux had always had some
one power charged with the duty of
interpreting the rule. A similar tribunal
is indispensable in every well-ordered
state. It guards the law
from the deviations of custom, and
the abuse of private interpretation.
It affords to it unity and fixedness.
Every modern government has its
supreme court of appeals, which exists
almost solely for this object.
But the institution of these latter
is comparatively recent, while the
church has possessed hers for many
ages, and, in fact, gave to those of
the state the first impulse and example.</p>

<p>The Congregation of the Index
was established by St. Pius V. Its
powers were afterward extended and
confirmed by Gregory XIII. in 1572,
by Sixtus V. in 1588, by Clement
VIII. in 1595, and by other sovereign
pontiffs. The principle upon
which its authority reposes is indisputable.
In every age the church
has restrained the propagation of
false doctrines and prohibited the
perusal of such books as were dangerous
to faith and morals. The invention
of printing, in 1450, constrained
it to watch with increased
solicitude for the accomplishment of
this duty. In 1513, the fifth Council
of Lateran forbade the publication
of any book without its previous examination
by the ordinary of the
place. The efforts put forth for the
spread of Protestantism called for
efforts still more vigorous in defence
of the church. The Council of
Trent reënacted the laws concerning
the Index. It published the ten rules
which are now regarded as the germ
of all modern legislation concerning
the press. The establishment of this
congregation was but the organization
and practical realization of those
principles which the church has always
recognized, and of which all
states to-day admit the necessity.</p>

<p>The Congregation of the Index
examines books and forbids those
which are false and immoral. Christians
have need of some learned and
impartial authority to designate for
them such books as they ought not
to read, and all sincere men admit the
usefulness of this warning; for many
books are certainly unprofitable and
injurious to every one. Even though
civil governments have criticised the
rules of the Index, they have not
hesitated to adopt and use them as
the nucleus of their legislation concerning
the press. The oath imposed
upon printers and booksellers, the
deposit of a copy of each work before
it is offered for sale, the obligation
of placing upon the title-page
the name of the printer, and of the
signature of the writers to articles in
newspapers, are all embodied in the
rules of Clement VII. The prescriptions
of the Index forbid the
distribution of manuscript and printed
books which have not been duly
approved, in the same manner as the
state prohibits those which have not
been duly stamped; except that the
church has not invented stamps, nor
does a revenue result from its prescriptions.
Moreover, the state demands
an approbation, or, in other
words, exercises a censorship, which,
though now very greatly decried, is
still enforced in regard to plays, and,
when occasion demands, to other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
publications also. There is merely
this difference, that the church causes
its books to be examined by bishops,
by cardinals, by men who are at
once learned and impartial, while
civil governments confide this responsibility
to men who are often more
ignorant and less careful of morality
than the authors whom they control.
The state has indeed adopted the institution
of the church, but it has
greatly perverted it.</p>

<p>The decisions of this congregation
are binding in all places; not because
the tribunal is infallible, but because
it is supreme, and because the popes
have extended its authority over the
whole church. Some, like the Gallicans,
have claimed the validity of
their contrary usages; but no custom
can avail against law, especially when
it is universally acknowledged that
the power of the lawgiver extends
over the whole world, and that no
person, whatever his rank, or titles, or
privileges, is exempt from its decrees.</p>

<p>The Congregation of Bishops was
established by Gregory XIII. The
Congregation of Regulars, which was
afterward established by Sixtus V.,
was, at a still later day, united to
that of Bishops. This congregation,
which is one of the most busy of
them all, occupies in the church a
sphere analogous to that of a council
of state. It possesses administrative
faculties. It deputes visitors apostolic
to different provinces, appoints
vicars in dioceses whose bishops become
incapacitated, and sends forth
religious to visit the houses of their
several orders. It is the natural protectress
of charitable institutions. It
approves of the sales, exchanges, and
pledges of the property pertaining to
churches and monasteries. It has
also deliberative attributes, and decides
upon questions submitted to it
by bishops, religious houses, and institutions;
except such as may involve
the interpretation of the canons
of the Council of Trent. It has
prepared the greater part of the bulls
which have been issued during the
past three hundred years. In short,
it exercises an administrative jurisdiction
over, and decides disputes
which arise between, different churches,
bishops, chapters, orders, and religious,
and whatever other matters of
controversy directly concern the clergy.
Its prompt method of procedure
causes even lay people, who voluntarily
submit their cases to Rome, to prefer
its jurisdiction. It does not adjudge
according to the vigorous strictness
of the law, but endeavors, as far as
possible, to appease the parties and
reconcile their disagreements. Appeals
in criminal cases, except where
the offence is within the peculiar cognizance
of the Holy Office, are also
brought before this congregation.</p>

<p>We are not able to examine each
of these congregations in detail. All
possess the same characteristics of
wisdom and prudence which distinguish
every institution established by
the popes. The Congregation of
Rites was organized for the preservation
of traditional vestments, liturgies,
and worship, and to prevent that incessant
change which degrades state
ceremonial, and often rashly increases
its expenses. The Congregation of
Schools corresponds to our boards
of public education; though the latter
are of extremely recent origin,
while the former has subsisted since
the age of Sixtus V. The Congregation
for the Examination of Bishops
receives testimonials concerning the
doctrine and habits of candidates
for the episcopate. It fills the place
of a court of inquiry, from which
proceed nominations of public officers,
even of the highest rank;
where influences of every kind antagonize
each other; where titles are
forgotten; and where the aptitude of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
every candidate, intellectual and moral,
is carefully scrutinized.</p>

<p>These various congregations become,
however, safeguards of truth
and freedom, not only by the variety
of their faculties, but also by their internal
structure and their methods of
procedure. Each of them is composed
of a cardinal-prefect, of a certain
number of cardinals, and a secretary.
To this the Congregation of
the Holy Office, which is presided
over by the pope himself, forms an
exception.</p>

<p>The prefect is charged with the
arrangement of the business of the
congregation. He manages the preparation
of causes prior to their discussion.
He submits them to the examination
of his colleagues, and presides
at their deliberations. After
the debate has terminated, he receives
their suffrages and announces their
decision. He also examines into
those matters which are settled at a
private audience with the pope, without
being brought before the whole
congregation, and his words give
publicity to the decisions which he
receives from the living voice of the
pontiff himself. Finally, he determines
alone certain matters of minor
importance, which, on that account,
are neither brought before the congregation
nor the pope. He receives
his appointment from the sovereign
pontiff, and holds his office during
life. When he is absent, his place is
supplied by the oldest cardinal of the
congregation, and, at his death, the
cardinal-secretary of state places his
signature to the nomination of the
new prefect.</p>

<p>The secretary assists at the meetings
of the congregations, and is
charged with the duty of recording
its resolutions and acts, of transcribing
its registers, and of delivering its
processes. He also summons the
cardinals, presents to them at each
session a brief of the causes they are
to treat, and gives them, for each of
these, a succinct statement of the
principal arguments of the parties,
with a summary of the documents
pertaining to them. This statement
is printed upon loose sheets and distributed
to the cardinals several days
in advance, in order that each may
have time to fully investigate the affair.
Sometimes this statement is
prepared by the cardinal-reporter,
hence called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cardinal ponent</i>.
The secretary also submits to the
pope the sentences of which he is
to approve; and, for this purpose,
those of the different congregations
have a day of special audience before
the pontiff. The faculty of giving
licenses for various purposes, such as
reading prohibited books, etc., etc., is
confided to the secretary; also the
power to distribute copies of the decrees
of the congregation, authenticated
by the signatures of the prefect
and the secretary, and sealed with
the seal of the congregation, which
thus become of valid force before all
tribunals, and even elsewhere, if they
treat of extra-judicial matters.</p>

<p>The secretaries are appointed by
the pope himself. They must be
bishops, with the title of a church <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in
partibus infidelium</i>, or, at least, prelates
of the Roman court. In the
Congregation of the Holy Office the
secretary is a cardinal.</p>

<p>The secretary has under him a
number of inferior officials&mdash;a vice-secretary,
who supplies his place
when vacant; a protocol, who takes
care of those records in which are registered
current matters of business,
with the state of their examination;
a master of rolls, who preserves the
various documents; and copyists,
who prepare duplicates and exemplifications.
All these are under his
control, and for them all he is responsible.
They are chosen at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
general session and hold office for
life. They rank in the order of their
seniority. Their remuneration is
moderate, but they enjoy it during
life, even when sickness or old age
prevents the fulfilment of their duties.</p>

<p>To these congregations, moreover,
are attached a number of theologians
and canonists, who act as counsellors
in the investigation of different questions,
and assist with their advice
those cardinals whose place it is to
determine causes. These also are
appointed for life by the pope, and,
as they are generally taken from the
religious orders, they are never absent
or obliged to leave Rome without
the permission of the congregation.</p>

<p>These counsellors prefer their
opinions in various forms, according
to the character of the congregation.
Sometimes one of them is requested
to present a written solution of some
especial question; sometimes they
are all summoned to hold a united
deliberation and give their collective
vote before the cardinals.</p>

<p>The parties who appear before
these congregations are represented
in their presence by proctors and advocates.
The proctors act in the
same capacity as our attorneys.
They are the true defenders of their
cause by law and in fact. They
compose the petitions, digest the informations,
and direct the whole proceedings.
Their profession is very
honorable, but not open to every one.</p>

<p>Advocates are employed only in
matters of higher importance, and
seldom except in those of abstract
law. They disengage, as far as possible,
every question from the circumstances
of fact which surround it,
and examine it doctrinally from the
most elevated point of view. Their
profession is free; but in order to exercise
it one must be a doctor of civil
and canon law, and consequently
must have spent four years in study
at the Sapienza, or three years at the
Apollinaria. They are not limited
in number, and are permitted to appear
before any of the congregations.
There are also special advocates belonging
to the consistory, who deal
only with the process of canonization.
All of these are men well versed in
theological learning, canons, councils,
ecclesiastical history, civil and canon
law, and by their own erudition contribute
vastly to the advancement of
jurisprudence.</p>

<p>Besides proctors and advocates,
there are also solicitors who take
charge of various transactions and
proceedings, hasten on investigations,
and are employed in extra-judicial
affairs.</p>

<p>The method of procedure before
these congregations differs according
to the congregation, the nature of the
business, and even the will of the
parties themselves. It may likewise
be distinguished into the ordinary,
the summary, the inquisitorial, etc.,
etc., and is regulated by positive
rules or by custom. They are well
known to all, and, in practice, never
give rise to any confusion.</p>

<p>We do not desire here to enter
into details concerning these different
modes of procedure. We can only
go so far as to make known their
general character, and to compare it
with our own civil proceedings, which
are sometimes, we think groundlessly,
supposed to be a model for all others.</p>

<p>We select, as a type of the whole,
the usages of the Congregation of the
Council. This congregation receives
appeals from the sentences of ordinaries,
and also causes submitted to it
by the consent of the parties; the
latter being equally proper with the
former, provided the rules are equally
observed. These causes are usually
commenced by the sending of a summons
to the opposite party through a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
public official, in the same manner as
in civil processes. At the outset,
however, a particular formality, called
the settlement of the question, is observed.
The object of this is to determine
the precise point upon which
the decision of the congregation is
desired. For this purpose it is necessary
that an issue be joined between
the adverse parties, upon some
definite proposition.... This is
done either by the parties themselves
or their proctors, in presence of the
secretary of the congregation, and, in
their default, the secretary himself
explains it in writing, or, when requisite,
the congregation is called to determine
it.</p>

<p>This summons for the settlement
of the question is served fifteen days
before the date of the proceeding itself.
At the same time, the original
and authenticated writings which the
parties have employed, as well as a
statement of the facts, signed by the
proctor, must be deposited at the
office of the secretary. If judicial
inquests and the deposition of witnesses
are necessary, they are taken
by the ordinary in the capacity of
judge-delegate, the congregation not
being able to act at a distance. The
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">procès-verbal</i> authenticated and duly
legalized, are transmitted to it;
but as the causes generally come before
it by appeal, all these investigations
of fact are previously concluded,
and the ordinary sends forward the
entire papers of the case.</p>

<p>The defences of parties are presented
in written memorials in the
Latin tongue, signed by an advocate
or by a proctor approved by the Roman
court. These memorials are
deposited with the secretary and
communicated to the complainants,
as are also copies of all documents
that are produced, in nearly the same
manner as in the highest civil tribunals.
These memorials are in turn
succeeded by written replications,
signed and filed in the same way.
Unless by special permission, the
memorials are limited to five printed
sheets, and the replications to two.
In case of negligence, the proctor is
liable to a penalty. No supplementary
writings are admissible.</p>

<p>From these papers the secretary
makes memoranda, briefly setting
forth the whole affair and the principal
arguments, the facts and the law,
as claimed by the parties, all of which,
together with the defences and replications,
are printed and distributed
in duplicate to the cardinals. These,
then, receive separately the parties
with their advocates and listen to
their explanations, if they judge any
to be useful to their cause. These
interviews are not, however, secret.
Both adversaries have their audiences,
and they contribute very much
to elucidate doubtful matters.</p>

<p>The day of decision is fixed by
the secretary. There is never any
delay except for the greatest reasons.
The production of the defences must
take place at least thirty days before
that of final judgment. The printed
memoranda are distributed at least
six days before it. The circulation
of the papers and supplemental documents
is finished in the same interval.
The audiences to parties are granted
within the last four or five days which
precede. The distribution of replications
is made at latest the day before
the session. After this, no notice is
taken of any testimony or document
produced by one of the parties, unless
with the consent of the other.</p>

<p>There are no contradictory pleadings,
no public audiences. Every
thing is done in writing. The cardinals,
well instructed in the cause from
the defences, replications, documents,
memoranda of the secretaries, and
the previous verbal explanations of
the advocates, assemble on the appointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
day and deliberate out of
the hearing of the parties. This deliberation
is secret, and sometimes
takes place between two audiences.</p>

<p>After judgment is rendered, the
losing party has ten days in which to
petition for a new trial for the revision
of the sentence by the same
congregation. The prefect grants
this petition; the new hearing takes
place at the end of three months; and
the party who demands it, if defeated,
defrays the expenses.</p>

<p>When sentence has been rendered,
and has become of full force as a
judgment, an exemplification of it is
transmitted to the winning party, who
presents it at the executive office of
letters-apostolic and of decrees of
congregations, in order that it may
be couched in the requisite formularies.</p>

<p>The proceedings before the Congregation
of Bishops and Regulars
closely resemble those before the
Congregation of the Council. The
delays are somewhat shorter, but
the ordinary procedure is the same.
Before both of them there is also
a species of process more swift and
summary, to be employed when the
parties desire it, or the nature of
the business demands it. Moreover,
in the latter congregation it is the
secretary who renders its decision.</p>

<p>We have seen that appeals in criminal
cases are taken from the diocesan
courts to the Congregation of
Bishops and Regulars, except when
the nature of the offence brings it
within the cognizance of the Congregation
of the Holy Office. This appeal
must be entered within ten days
after the promulgation of the judgment.
After the appeal is perfected,
the diocesan court transmits to the
congregation a budget which includes:
1, the process which was
instituted in the first instance; 2,
the brief of this process and the note
of that which followed; 3, the defence
of the accused; 4, the sentence.
At the same time the court
signifies to the accused and his advocate
that they are now to prosecute
their appeal.</p>

<p>If the appellant does not pursue
the matter, a reasonable delay, ordinarily
of twenty days, is accorded, after
which he is judged to have renounced
his appeal and the sentence
is executed. If he does pursue it,
he makes choice of an advocate at
Rome. The budget is then sent to
a judge-reporter, from whose hands
the advocate receives a memorandum
of the case, and upon that bases his
defence. This defence is communicated
to the first judge, that he may
sustain his sentence. All the papers
are printed and distributed to the
cardinals. The cause is examined
on an appointed day in presence of
the assembled congregation. The
judge-reporter states the case. The
proctor-general defends the sentence
of the court below. The cardinals
render their decision, which affirms,
vacates, or revises the sentence of
the diocesan tribunal, and is immediately
transmitted thereto for execution.
This decision is final; and, after
it is rendered, the pope alone can
grant a review of the proceedings,
and that only before the same congregation,
and for the gravest reasons.</p>

<p>It will be remarked that there is
no public hearing of witnesses; but
if this should seem objectionable to
any, it will be sufficient to remind them
that civil courts, which revise the judgments
of courts of correction, decide
upon the papers of the case and not
upon the testimony of living witnesses
at their bar; while, as for criminal
proceedings, it is well known that
from the courts which try issues of
fact there is usually no appeal.</p>

<p>When, instead of an ordinary offence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the crime alleged is one against
the faith, the rules of procedure are
inquisitorial in their character, and
differ somewhat from the preceding;
but on account of the weight of the
penalty, they offer still greater safeguards
to the accused.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is not requisite that
all the witnesses should have been
present during the whole transaction
in question; the deposition of a single
one is admissible, though it is
necessary that there be more than
two, and even three form but a sort
of half-proof. All interrogatories,
skilfully directed to extort the truth
from the defendant or the witnesses
by surprise, are strictly forbidden, as
are also any suggestions of the answer
desired, and every effort is
made that the truth may flow naturally
from the lips of the witness and
without the influence of fear. In order
to avoid hatred and terrorism,
the names of the witnesses are not
made known to the accused, but
their motives of hostility to him are
examined with the greatest care.
False witnesses are punished with
the utmost severity, and, when it becomes
necessary, the accused and
accusers are confronted with each
other.</p>

<p>If from poverty, or any other reason,
the accused is found without an
advocate or proctor, one is furnished
for him.</p>

<p>Finally, the appeal is a matter of
right. It is taken directly to Rome,
before the Congregation of the Holy
Office, without passing through any
intermediate metropolitan tribunal,
and, during its pendency there, execution
is usually stayed. Judgment
is never rendered against any one
upon mere presumptions; but only
after full and unmistakable proof.</p>

<p>We come now to notice the written
regulations which may be called the
skeleton of procedure. Save some
variations in detail, they differ little
from those of all contested cases before
the different congregations. But
in order fully to understand their advantages
and disadvantages, the reader
should understand not only the
text of the law but the usages of its
practices. For everywhere, at Rome
as at Paris, unwritten traditions and
judicial customs modify and temper
the law, complete its deficiencies, and
cause the inconveniences which, at
first sight, it would seem to occasion,
wholly to disappear. It is also impossible
to base a serious comparison
between the procedure of two countries
upon a mere reading of their
rules. Not only ought the two
methods to vary according to the
manners of the parties, the character
of the tribunals, and the nature of
their causes, but even two modes
which are identical will often, under
different circumstances, produce entirely
different results. They accommodate
themselves to the hand that
wields them, and their value can be
really appreciated only after long
usage of them; so that the skilled
practitioner alone is able to speak authoritatively
of their value, of their
endurance, and of the guarantees
which they offer for the discovery of
truth.</p>

<p>By these remarks we desire to
show that the procedure of the Roman
congregations, without sacrificing
any of the essential safeguards of
justice, is generally simple, brief,
economical, informal to a degree beyond
that of any civil procedure;
and, far from needing to learn any
thing from them, it is able in many
points to become their instructor.</p>

<p>There is, however, one great difference
upon which we especially insist,
because it has formed the pretext for
unjust attacks from narrow minds,
who are unable to comprehend that
any thing can be well done that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
done in a way different from their
own, or that any difference between
their customs and those of others is
not a signal mark of the inferiority of
the latter. The Roman congregations
admit of no oral pleadings.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
All discussion is in writing, though
it is necessarily completed by the verbal
explanations which the advocates
give to the judges; but there is no
public and passionate debate, such as
is common in all civil jurisdictions.
We do not believe that the absence
of this is any evil. The Roman legislative
body has always endeavored
to shun surprises in its hearings.
Pleading, as it is practised among us,
is nothing but the conflict of two
opposing debaters, often unequally
matched, and of whom the more powerful
is seldom on the side of the oppressed.
We believe, indeed, that the
doors of the influential advocate,
whose name and authority are themselves
a powerful argument, are rarely
closed against the poor who seek
to enter them; but the poor do not
always dare to stop and knock, and
so content themselves with men of
more ordinary abilities. If, then, one
of these contesting advocates is more
skilful than the other; if he knows
how to win favor for his client by an
insinuating speech and to cast ridicule
upon his adversary; if he has the
faculty of grouping figures, of coloring
facts, of flattering his auditors
during the progress of the controversy;
if he is passionate and violent, his
emotion will affect the judge, whose
heart beats under his robe and is not,
perhaps, to any extraordinary degree
unimpressible; all these circumstances,
extrinsic to the real merits of
the cause, will exercise great influence
upon its determination, and
may be able to wring from the tribunal
a decision which, in moments of
reflection and coolness, it would never
render.</p>

<p>Oral pleading resembles, to some
extent, those ancient judicial combats
upon which the issue of causes
was sometimes made to depend. It
is a duel of words, in which justice
does not always have the advantage.
Our imagination represents an advocate
as one whose work it is to wrest
the innocent from the clutches of
powerful and cruel persecutors; who
summons eloquence to aid him in
resisting the fierce passions which
menace the welfare of his client.
This was well enough for those primitive
ages when a legal process was
the outburst of violent wrath, which
dragged the alleged offender before a
single judge, or perhaps before a
mob erected into a tribunal and
swayed by passion. But this conception
is not correct for our day,
even in criminal matters, where the
public prosecutor, as far as possible,
excludes mere feeling and makes his
appeal to calm and solid reason
alone; and it is especially false in
civil causes, in which the advocate
interprets the text of the law, discusses
contracts, examines and compares
evidence, all of which labors
are difficult, and demand, above all
things, reflection, good sense, and
coolness.</p>

<p>For attaining, therefore, the ends
of justice, a mode of written procedure
is particularly adapted. It assures to
the contending parties all the time
necessary for a careful reply to the
reasonings on either side, and establishes
an equality between the talents
of their respective advocates; it also
removes the decision of the cause
from the bias of personal influences,
and leaves it to be determined by argument
only. Moreover, the judge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
is able to reflect at his ease upon the
merits of the case, and is secure
against the seductions of artful declamation.
Even before those supreme
civil tribunals where written and oral
pleadings are both permitted, the
latter are usually regarded in the solution
of the question, and this is
what gives to the advocates of those
illustrious courts their influence and
renown. The Roman congregations
are also supreme tribunals; but there
passion has no echo and needs no
interpreter; there causes stand upon
their own merits, stripped of all attendant
circumstances; there the
gravest questions of dogma, of morals,
and of right are decided by reason
alone, but by reason illuminated
both by science and by faith.</p>

<p>The procedure of the Roman congregations
is much less expensive
than that before ordinary civil jurisdictions.
Originally it was entirely
gratuitous, and many of the congregations&mdash;as,
for instance, those of the
Propaganda, the Index, and the Holy
Office&mdash;still retain this rule in reference
to all the causes which are submitted
to them. But the great increase of
expense, consequent upon the increase
of causes, has necessitated the
establishment, by other congregations,
of certain light taxes, although
even these bear small proportion to
the actual disbursements. Thus, all
the proceedings are upon ordinary
paper, which, not being liable to
stamp-duty, makes one important
saving in expense. Again, while
civil proceedings are registered upon
payment of a certain fee, which is
another notable method of taxation,
those at Rome are registered without
charge; and, while masters of rolls
elsewhere enjoy incomes sometimes
reaching the sum of many thousands,
those at Rome are paid by the treasurer,
and are forbidden to receive any
emolument, although perfectly gratuitous,
from any party, even for the
most extraordinary labors&mdash;an obligation
imposed on them by oath
upon their admission to office.</p>

<p>They are also obliged to exhibit,
without charge, to any person
the various documents of their several
bureaus, and are allowed but a
moderate recompense for the copies
and exemplifications which they may
prepare. Even the expense of printing
is borne, at least in part, by the
congregation. The congregations do
not sell justice; they give it. The
pontifical treasury does not look to
them as a source of revenue. On
the contrary, the taxes they collect
are far less than their expenses, and,
in fact, so much so that their services
may be considered as gratuitous.
For example, a matrimonial cause
submitted to the Congregation of the
Council, and requiring minute examinations,
consultations, researches,
and a large collection of documents,
will cost the winning party several
crowns, the precise amount depending
upon the number of questions to
be resolved. The same case tried
in civil courts would cost two or three
thousand francs.</p>

<p>The fees of advocates and attorneys
correspond to the expenses.
Among us they continue constantly
to increase. At Rome they are very
meagre. They are legally fixed at
a uniform rate, according to the importance
of the cause and the result
of the investigation. Even these
the advocates cannot demand as a
right, and receive them only as a
spontaneous gift.</p>

<p>The French magistracy with good
reason congratulates itself on the establishment
of an association designed
to secure to the poor the gratuitous
defence of their just rights. Rome
has long since possessed a similar institution.
This is the Society of Advocates,
which assembles on fête days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
to receive and reply to the inquiries
of the indigent. Among the obligations
of the consistorial advocates is
that of defending the causes of the
poor before their respective tribunals.
In criminal cases there are especial
advocates for the poor. Among the
proctors there are certain ones appointed
for the poor, one by the
pope, the others by the different societies.
Finally, the Society of St.
Ives is particularly charged with the
protection of the indigent; and such
are the customs among the members
of the Roman bar that none ever refuses
his services to the unfortunate
who seeks them.</p>

<p>The Roman congregations are not
mere tribunals instituted by the holy
see with a delegation of powers,
which leaves the supreme authority
still in the hands of the sovereign
pontiff, and allows a right of appeal
from their judgment to his. They
are the holy see itself, rendering its
decisions by the mouths of its cardinals.
Canon law recognizes their jurisdiction
as ordinary and not delegated.
Delegated jurisdiction is a
mandate which confers upon the
mandatary certain special favors distinct
from and inferior to the powers
of the mandator. Ordinary jurisdiction
is an actual communication,
which unites the mandator and mandatary
in one single tribunal, and
makes the one the simple organ of
the other. Numerous passages of
canon law justify this conception of
these congregations and render it incontestable
as a legal conclusion.</p>

<p>The nature of the decisions which
they render makes the point still
more certain. They issue general
decrees promulgated by order of the
sovereign pontiff, which consequently
obtain the force of law in all places
in the same manner as the pontifical
constitutions, from which they do not
essentially differ. Such are the decrees
of the Holy Office, of the Index,
and certain of those of the Congregation
of Rites, of that of the Council,
and of that of Bishops and Regulars.
They also render interpretations of
existing laws, and these enjoy a supreme
and universal authority, as if
they emanated directly from the
sovereign pontiff, since they are both
submitted to and approved by him.
In fine, the sentences which they
render in private controversies are,
equally with the rest, submitted to
the pope; though without this sanction,
and from the ordinary powers of
the congregations, they would be obligatory
upon all, and would become
the rule of other tribunals, since for
this purpose especially were these
congregations instituted as courts of
final judicature.</p>

<p>The decisions rendered by these
different congregations, and preserved
in their archives from the very day
of their institution to the present,
form the most magnificent body of
jurisprudence which has ever existed.
One canonist of eminence reckons
that upward of sixty thousand
decisions have been delivered by the
Congregation of the Council alone;
a living, practical commentary on the
Council of Trent. The Congregation
of Bishops and Regulars publishes
nearly three volumes of decrees every
year, and the volumes which contain
its judgments are over eight hundred
in number. When we remember
that nearly all these decisions are
upon questions of law, disengaged
from mere accessories of fact, we are
amazed at the treasures of science,
erudition, and reasoning which are
thus accumulating from age to age in
these archives, and forming an inexhaustible
reservoir, in which tradition
stores itself and whence justice and
truth flow out upon the world.</p>

<h2>AN OCTOBER REVERIE.</h2>


<p>This most golden of all the bright
October days, why are we not, as
we fain would be, on a brown
hill-side, yielding care to whispered
persuasions of the wind, or afloat on
waters that reflected our sky, when&mdash;if
it was not always without clouds&mdash;its
clouds were tinged with glory, or
lying upon a shore where we built
sand castles in play&mdash;alas! for castles
we built in earnest, to hold treasures
of hope&mdash;and laughed to see them
dissolve in the laughing waves.</p>

<p>We have no wish to pluck the hill-side
flowers; we shall never build
castles again, never chase back the
encroaching waves, which, while
they seemed to recede, rose till they
buried our castles and swept away
our treasures.</p>

<p>But it will be something to share
the repose of nature; to lie on her
lap lulled by the requiem of the past,
chanted by the voice that sang the
anthem of the future. For we&mdash;her
deluded children&mdash;are weary, and
only ask of her a foretaste of the rest
we hope to find by and by in her
bosom.</p>

<p>How weary we are! Of strivings
from which we have no power to
cease! Of reachings, from which we
cannot withhold our hands, toward
objects that elude us or turn worthless
in our grasp! Weary of our own
and others' weakness and meanness!
Of lying lives; of suspicions, envyings,
and covetings! How tired of homely
work; oppressed by narrow rooms,
vexed by noises of neighbors separated
from us only by the legal number
of inches in brick and mortar&mdash;a
loud-talking, stamping family on one
side, and on the other the household
of Widow Smith, who keeps boarders
and a piano!</p>

<p>By sounds that come up through
the open window, I know that the
widow is in her kitchen helping to
get the dinner. I seem to see her,
hot and worried. She is always
worried. Her face would be a sad
one if she had time to let it settle
into its proper expression. As she
never has time, it is anxious and fretful,
and older than her years. In
the parlor, so near that the jangling
of untuned wires sets my whole being
on edge, her daughter is playing
the piano as she sings, <i>I dreamt that I
dwelt in Marble Halls</i>. Poor child!
Yet dream on. Who could undeceive
thee, knowing that there is
woven into thy dream the pious resolve
to win out of that discordant
instrument money wherewith to buy
thy mother ease? Heaven help
thee and bring to naught the spite
of the bachelor boarder in the room
above, who, instead of employing his
grizzly brain with the plan gossips
have devised, by which he might
brighten her life and thine, and his
own most of all, paces up and down,
cursing the noise, and consigning
"that old tin pan" to a place his imagination
keeps in a blaze with fuel
of whatsoever offends him. He hates
"that eternal thrumming," hates
"genteel daughters of working mothers.
Teach music! Better dismiss
Nora and make Miss Julia help in the
kitchen!"</p>

<p>It might be as well, but it is no
affair of his.</p>

<p>Moreover, the mother has her
dream. In it she sees her daughter
less hard-worked than she has been,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
and higher in the social scale than
she ever hopes to rise; except, perhaps,
when that daughter shall have
exchanged Smith for Smythe.</p>

<p>But of all the vexations of our life
here, the most persistent is the row
of houses across the way. Beset by
so many things that offend the other
senses, we think it hard that our sight
should be so meanly thwarted. I
grow angry whenever I look out, and
wish that I could push those houses
down. I pine to see beyond them
the curve of a bay bounded by hills,
a stretch of river with steamboats
and sails, and of shore with a village
and farms on its slope, distant mountains
blending with sky, or outlined
against piled thunder-caps. Or a
harbor with ships; some at anchor,
some bound outward, and some coming
in from strange countries.</p>

<p>I keep fancying that the houses
hide these sights, though I know
there is nothing behind them but row
on row, more brown, stony, and dull.
These are low, and shut out less of
the sky. The veneering, which is of
plaster instead of stone, is falling
off, here and there, to save it from
monotony. The uniform dwellings,
with their line of connecting porches,
remind one of the inside of a fort,
and of careless, gossiping, uncertain
sojourn in quarters.</p>

<p>Widow Smith does not mind the
wall that offends us. She told me
her story the other day; all she had
gone through. What grieves her
most, as nearly as I could make it
out, is living in a house that is not
high. "For," said she, as with a
little tearful burst of eloquence she
ended her tale, "I hev lived in a
three-story and basement, all to ourselves,
and always kept a girl, and
the folks next door didn't let out
ther floors. Though," (wiping her
eyes,) "I've nothin' aginst them
Browns. They behave themselves as
well as some" (Mrs. Green, over the
way, who keeps two servants, and
does not visit Mrs. Smith and me)
"thet's hed more advantages."</p>

<p>I answered, "These houses might
do while rents are so high, if the partitions
were thicker, and if that row
opposite did not hide the view;"
meaning the view in my mind. Mrs.
Smith could not have seen it; for she
replied that "We mustn't be notional;
real troubles come fast enough
without borrowin'. Since Smith
died," she had "hed her share, the
Lord knew." If she "let sech things"
make her "mis'rable," she should think
that she was "goin' contrary to Scripter,
wich speaks aginst the sight of the
eyes." Then, "of all things, a place
not built up was the forlornist." Besides,
she liked "neighbors." Good
soul! so she does; loves them, too.
I have known her to do "them
Browns" more than one kind turn;
and to us, when we came, poor, discouraged,
and unused to city ways,
she was guide, philosopher, and
guardian angel, in the guise of a lugubrious
little woman in a rusty
mourning gown and yarn hood.
She taught us to market, urged upon
us the importance of asking the price
before buying, and of counting our
change afterward; encouraged us to
resist the aggressions of "the girl,"
enlightening us at the same time as
to the amount of service we might
require of that personage; stood up
for us with the milk-man, ice-man,
and man that peddles every thing,
and made them give us weight and
measure.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding that Mrs.
Smith is so sympathizing, it would
not have been worth while to return
her confidence by telling her of our
former affairs&mdash;pleasant places where
our lot was cast; the old house beautiful
we were born in; the hills, and
and the river that bathes their feet;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
purple ridges that lie eastward, blue
mountains that hide the west&mdash;scenes
so changeless in form that
memory does not err in always showing
them the same; so changeful in
aspect that they never wearied even
our accustomed eyes.</p>

<p>We cannot talk of these things to
one whose world is the city. Yet
there are in that world many who
will understand us&mdash;living in high
houses and low ones; on floors, in
garrets and dens; walking in rich attire,
shrinking in garments worn and
unseemly; mingling with others in
the mart, lying on sick-beds, shut
up in prisons&mdash;men for whom fame
blows glorious bubbles, but hollow
and frail, as none know better than
themselves.</p>

<p>Devotees of science whose Eurekas
sound more faintly at every step
as they mount her endless ladders;
not because they fall from such altitudes,
but because they become discouraged
as the conviction dawns on
them that all they have gained
amounts to little.</p>

<p>The trader whose vessels dot the
seas, who is not so elate with fortune
that he never sends a sigh after earlier
ventures&mdash;ships of bark with
freight of sand, on waters the width
of a boy's stride.</p>

<p>The gambler in the bread of the
poor, not so callous that he never
feels a twinge of the old wound, the
stab conscience gave the first time he
played "pitch and toss" on the blind
side of the school-house and won
foolish Richard's penny. He remembers
that Richard went crying
to his father for redress, and his mother
came and told the master, who
would not believe foolish Richard's
story against "the smartest boy and
the best at cypherin' in his school."
He escaped, but Richard was whipped
by his father for losing his money
and telling a lie. He distrusts conscience.
Why smite so then, why
touch so lightly now, if she can find
the difference between that childish
sin and this wringing hard-earned
pence from thousands of simple ones?</p>

<p>And the Father to whom the
wretches clamor so does not seem to
be a credulous father to them. Perhaps,
after all, he does not hear; or is,
like the master, on the side of those
who can help themselves. At any
rate, his mills grind so slowly that it
would hardly pay to compute the
time one's turn would take to come.
It may be that the wheels stand still,
waiting for all his floods to gather.</p>

<p>The politician, not so lost in tortuous
ways that the man depicted in
his first piece to speak, (it was chosen
by his good mother, and often
said over to her for fear of "missing"
on the momentous Friday,)</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The man whose utmost skill was simple truth;<br /></span>

<p>does not still stand on the old pedestal
in his secret heart.</p>

<p>Absent-eyed women, automatic
figures in collections of cabinet-work,
upholstery, pictures, and marbles, to
which no memories of theirs have
grown, lending attention to formal
visitors while their thoughts stray to
the play-house under a tree, where they
used to receive little friends in calico
sun-bonnets. The house of which
they themselves laid the moss carpet
and chose and placed the ornaments,
deserted bird's-nests filled with speckled
Solomon's Seal, curiosities from
the wood, and pretty stones from
the brook. For paintings, they had
green vistas and glimpses of village,
water, and sky. The service, of
acorn cups and bits of colored glass
and "chaney," was daily polished
and set out by their own hands on
the flat rock they "made believe"
was a table.</p>

<p>Women shawled with fabric of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Cashmere, borne above the envious
street, but heeding neither its shifting
crowd nor its shows. They are
thinking of chances enjoyed the
more for their unexpectedness, and
paid in "kerchies" and "thank'ee,
sirs" they used to "catch," when
they went to the district school wrapped
in homespun shoulder blankets
that took caressing softness from fingers&mdash;cold
alas! now&mdash;that pinned
them on. Of balmy, luxurious rides
on the heaped hay-rigging. Slow,
never to be forgotten cart rides in
back-woods, where wintergreen and
princess-pine send up aromatic odors
from beneath the oxen's feet; with
wheels now sinking in moss, now
craunching the pebbles of the stream,
now swept by ferns, and anon pressing
down saplings that, released,
spring back with a jerk and an impatient
protest of leaves. Onward,
through sun-glorified arcades, listening
to comments of birds that are all
about, though each one seems solitary,
startled by the beat of a partridge,
or catching a sight of her nest.
Bending low to escape unbending
arms of patriarchs of the wood that
fend the way. Peering anxiously into
the gathering night; coming out
upon the clearing, where skeletons of
forest trees, martyrs to progress, that
perished by her axe or her flames,
lie dimly outlined amid shadows, or
stand gaunt against the sky, with
charred arms outstretched in motionless
appeal.</p>

<p>Or of rides in the lumber-wagon,
when grandfather&mdash;whom we cannot
describe from lack of words sufficiently
expressive of venerableness and
benignity&mdash;held the "lines," and
"Tom and Jerry," in sympathy with
childish impatience and delight, sped
up hill and down, till, amid clatter
and rattle, and excited barkings, and
joyful exclamations, and a peremptory
"whoa!" and "stand there, you
Jerry!" (Jerry never would stand
there, nor anywhere, he was such a
horse to go,) followed by a volley of
juvenile "whoas!" and "stand, Jerrys,"
the wagon drew up before the
house, and a young aunt ran to lift
the children out, while grandmother
stood in the door beaming on them
a smile whereof the warmth has
passed down through the folds of
years, and glows still on hearts from
which time has shut out the light of
ardent fires.</p>

<p>Did I say that crowd and shows
were unheeded? That elegant leader
and lawgiver of society, Mrs. Augustus
Jonesnob, who glides along in
an emblazed carriage, behind those
splendid ponies, would not pass, if
she knew that she and her "turnout"
elicited only a vague, half pitying
recollection of a "they say" that
gives her the keeper of a junk-shop
for grandfather, making it likely that
she has no heirloom of tapestry, in
fadeless azure, and green, and gold,
wherewith to hang the halls she always
dreamed of, without dreaming
how bare she would find them.</p>

<p>Young Augustus&mdash;"Point-Lace Jonesnob,"
the girls call him&mdash;rides beside
his mother's carriage, well-dressed,
well-mounted, smiling complacently,
for he knows that he looks about the
thing; and the day being neither too
cold nor too warm, nor muddy, dusty,
windy, nor too early in the season,
he thinks it will do to show himself.
Does any one suppose his
smile to be the emanation from some
reminiscence of "taking the horses to
water" in boyhood? The riding-master's
hand, and not the proud father's,
held him on the first time he was
mounted. He has no breezy remembrances
of free gallops whither he
would; no pensive memories of solemn
rides across lonesome barrens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
where heavenward-pointing pines worship
God with ceaseless harmonies and
unfailing incense.</p>

<p>Men whose life, sold for a salary,
is the property of others; who spend
the hours they ought to have for recreation
in street-cars, while ill-used
brutes drag them from and to homes
in comfortless suburbs, where faded
wives, worn with housework that
never ends, busy over piles of mending
that never diminish, wait, uncheerfully
ruminating devices and
economies by which they are for ever
trying to make ends approach that
are fated never to meet.</p>

<p>Broken-spirited gentlemen in threadbare
black, worn and brushed till the
seams, notwithstanding the times they
have been inked, are gray, walking,
walking, in search of employment;
asking it deprecatingly, for they are
honorable, and are beginning to realize&mdash;others
have long seen it&mdash;their
incapacity. Returning faint&mdash;the bite
at the baker's counter is beyond their
means&mdash;to pale wives, who meet them
with smiles that are more sad than
tears, and talk, while their hearts belie
their tongues, of better luck to-morrow.
Perhaps children, too, with
eyes that ask&mdash;they are too well
trained by their mother to demand
with their lips.</p>

<p>Women that have seen better days,
paying their last dollar&mdash;it will bring
no return&mdash;for the ambiguous announcement
that makes known their
willingness to accept any position not
menial.</p>

<p>Elderly women, delicately bred,
once sheltered and inclosed by refined
prejudices and conventionalisms,
obliged, who knows by what stress, to
step out of the sacred (to them; they
are old-fashioned ladies) retirement
of home. If we must refuse to buy
the petty stationery, print, or book
they so courteously proffer, let it
be seen that we do it with pain; let
us not shut the door against these
timid sparrows till they have flitted
from the steps. They are not of
those to whom compassionate hesitation
suggests importunity.</p>

<p>Women narrow-chested and grim-visaged,
in whom there is no beauty
or charm left&mdash;pupils of virtue, to
whom she gives neither holiday nor
reward&mdash;toiling up steep flights with
bundles of shop-work.</p>

<p>Bedraggled women, that lug heavy
baskets down wet area steps into
sunless abodes, where they wash all
day, while the babes they have not
time to fondle want care and comforting,
and must want these or bread.</p>

<p>Sinful women, at whom, since
Christ is dead in the souls of men,
all may cast stones. For them there
is but little help or hope in a righteous
world.</p>

<p>Those who, by hallowed memories
of purer scenes, have been kept from
evil.</p>

<p>Those who, though fallen and
fouled, still guard, fair and apart, pictures
that fill their eyes with tears
and their hearts with yearnings&mdash;visions
of morning stepping down
the cliffs into valleys where they
dwelt; of sunsets in mountain countries;
tropical lands planted with
palms that incline exile-ward; snowy
regions where blazing hearths and
true hearts keep the place of the
wanderer warm.</p>

<p>Home dwells pictured in their soul.
It is an unpainted road-side house.
Sweet-pinks, marigolds, and holly-hocks
grow in the front-yard; morning-glories
creep up the clap-boards,
festoon the windows, and peep into
the wren's nest under the eve-trough.
In the maple by the doorstep a pair
of robins have made their habitation,
and amid the green of the elm that
roofs the spring and wash-block&mdash;the
stump of a former mighty tree&mdash;is
seen the glint of a fire-bird's wing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>Or a farm-house, with gardens and
rows of hives, and barns with their
swallows, fields of corn and stubble,
and upland pasture where cattle are
feeding. In "the new piece," between
the pasture and higher woodland,
buckwheat blossoms for the bees, as
it climbs perseveringly up the ridge
to overtake the poke, that, bending to
its weight of berries, mingles dawning
crimson with changing hues of
blackberry-vines which hide the rocks.
Along stone fences, golden-rod and
wild-aster still mingle their blooms untouched,
though autumn has reached
stained fingers forth to trifle with
the leaves of his favorite sumach.
In the swamp below, the scarlet
lobelia burns amid clumps of green
and brown sedge. Beyond the
swamp and meadow, and wind-whitened
willows by the creek, hills rise
and bound the view.</p>

<p>Or it is a homestead, with venerable
trees shading a lawn that slopes to a
lake in which house and trees lie mirrored.
They are playing with their
brothers on the lawn, while their
mother watches them from her window;
or gliding on the lake with
companions and loves of youth,
steering their boat for a distant headland.</p>

<p>These are living pictures. Their
woods sing Eolian measures; their
brooks talk of childhood and innocence;
their clouds and seasons are
always changing; their swallows ever
flying homeward, whither the trees
beckon. Miraculous pictures! their
sun always shines on our brides; their
skies rain constant tears on our dead.
Yea, in them the dead are risen, and
eyes long sealed look down on us
with love.</p>

<p>But beyond the headland the lake
has its outlet into a stream that winds
and tarries, all the while widening,
till it empties into the harbor, where
ships, laden with costly merchandise,
are spreading sails for havens of uncertain
promise. They fade along the
fading coast; glide across the dim belt
that separates land's end from sky;
like phantoms disappear. And watchers
turn, with a foreboding chill, from
windy piers, to confront dirty waterside
stores, and pick their way amid
trucks and bales that obstruct broken
side-walks, between tall warehouses
that glower at each other
across lanes, to meet odors of fish
and oils, and spices and drugs, and
countless other f&oelig;tid smells; to enter
dull, ledger-lined offices, or seek,
through jostling ways, ticketed
dwellings that are as alike as prison-cells.</p>

<p>Along the track that divides the
farm, and cuts the hill in two, shrieks
a train, grudging its passengers the
glimpse of beautiful places of the
rich; slackening its pace to prolong
the dreariness of the ugly outskirts,
and, lo! dead rows of houses; long
thoroughfares; mean streets, with
vile shops and squalid swarms; the
clash of vehicles; confusion of cries;
rush of multitudes&mdash;the city.</p>

<p>From the small house the by-road
leads to a turnpike that speeds dustily
on to a cobble-paved town by the
river. The river flows down to the
city; where all night long, hungrily
lapping slimy piers, with dark hints
of oblivion, with winks and gleams
that the wretched interpret, with
noiseless, snaky undulations, and the
fascinating glitter of its thousand eyes,
it charms the lost to loathsome death.</p>

<p>Would we, if cares did not bind us,
go back to the scenes of those pictures?
If our mother's face had
not gone from the window? If the
farm had not been sold? If alien
hands had not cut down the maple
and the elm, and strange faces and
the burr of unknown voices had not
scared the wrens from their nest? If
we had money or time for the journey?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
If we did not feel too much
ashamed or disgraced&mdash;we have been
so unsuccessful, or false to early promises&mdash;to
meet the pitying or contemptuous
looks of our acquaintance?
For did they not know how it would
be? Did not they too, in youth,
scent from afar the battle they knew
better than to enter without the certainty
of winning?</p>

<p>If we have, or seem to have won
it, is there not something in ourselves
that holds us back? We have now
no desire for sports of childhood.
We are not sorry that our mother
faded from her window before we got
hurts that her kisses could not make
well. The halo that surrounds venerated
figures would pale in the broad
light of mid-life. We are not so forbearing
with the old who are with us
that we could trust ourselves to have
the departed back.</p>

<p>Do we recognize the boys and
girls who lived in the small house by
the road, who used to get up early
and run laughing to the spring to
take turns washing in the tin basin
that hung against the elm? And the
faces mirrors now show us&mdash;are they
the same that rose radiant from that
bath? Could we sleep soundly in a
garret, and wake delighted to see
snow sifting through the roof? Or
relish the food we thought it neither
shame nor labor to carry when, bare-footed
in summer and shod in calf-skin
in winter, we walked a mile to
the red school-house down by the
'pike? Would we feel honored if the
madam were now to visit us in the
modest dress that we once thought
the perfection of taste?</p>

<p>When it was our week to conduct
her home, we neither hunted bird's-nests,
nor swung upon low branches
of the "mill-pines," nor dipped our feet
in mud-puddles to get "wedding-shoes"
on, nor sought berries along
the fences, unless it was to string them
on timothy-rods and present them
shyly for her acceptance.</p>

<p>Have we strength or inclination
for harvest work? Then to leaden
hearts and sluggish blood what pleasure
in moonlight sail, or midnight
sleigh-ride, or mad gallop over lift and
level!</p>

<p>Let us guard our sacred pictures.
To their scenes we will not return.
For if, instead of patches of sky, the
circle of the firmament were ours,
with changing glory of dawn, and
noon, and sundown, and deeps gleaming
with stars, yet our spirits would
not soar with their swallows. Their
mountains would not draw our feet
as they did when we believed that
every summit reached was a height
gained, knew not that the peaks
which pierced the clouds hid higher
ranges, yet no nearer the heaven of
hope than those which limited our
sight.</p>

<p>Is there no spot, dear friend, that
you and I would revisit?</p>

<p>Behold a worn foot-path in which
we may walk and gather immortelles!
It leads to a city whereof the
houses are low and hide none of the
sky; narrower than these, but straitness
does not inconvenience dwellers
who have no call to go to and fro;
not uniform&mdash;the occupants' names
are cut into fronts of marble and
granite and mossy red sand-stone.
Some are marked by columns, others
by crosses. Around many plants are
set. But here are others. The tenants
were poor or friendless folk, or
strangers; they have only clay walls
and roofs of sod, upon which every
blade, green or sere, all day long and
all night, bending lightly to airs of
summer or swept low by winter
winds, keeps sighing, "May he rest
in peace."</p>

<p>Old neighbors are here; but no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
looks of theirs question us as to what
we have done in the world, or in
what failed.</p>

<p>Did the sight of these at last turn inward?
and did lips that were so ready
with the Pharisee's prayer close with
the cry of the publican?</p>

<p>Old friends! But their hands are
cold and will never clasp ours again.
Enemies! Between them and us may
judgment be the offspring of Christian
kindness!</p>

<p>And here, hedged with arbor-vitæ,
is the place of our kin. Those of
them who passed hither before our
time we could never realize. Others
are dim remembrances; like the baby
sister that came one wild winter night,
to our great wonder, and, to our equal
sorrow, left us in spring for this small
habitation.</p>

<p>These were not long separated.
Dear old folks! one roof and one tablet
for two who had but one mind and
one heart. Here lies the little cousin
we quarrelled with at evening, to
shed over her in the morning our
first remorseful tears. Look through
the break in the hedge, on that square
slab&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Evelyn Grant.</span><br />
Aged 35.<br />
</p>

<p>Our first school-mistress. We hated
her with the impotent bitterness
of childish hearts outraged. For
did she not show partiality to the
dullest scholar she had?&mdash;because his
father was rich, the big boys said;
and thus we repeated it to our fond
if not judicious friend, old Diana,
when we complained to her of Miss
Evelyn's injustice in sending Alf
Whitfield up head every Monday.</p>

<p>"He is the oldest," she would say.
"As if oldness is any reason why a
great fellow like that should have a
better chance than the rest," we
would think. If we had understood how
much of Miss Evelyn's support depended
upon the favor of rich Squire
Whitfield, we might have felt differently.
They say that Alf's mother used
to beg of the mistress to encourage and
make much of the bashful half-wit,
who often wept because he could not
learn like the others.</p>

<p>We will pull the old weeds from
her grave. They shall not choke
flowers planted by the orphan nephews
she worked so hard to bring up
respectably&mdash;worked without a complaint
long after the cough we mocked
behind our primers had hacked
into her vitals.</p>

<p>Let us follow this road, beyond
the pines&mdash;a little higher&mdash;here.
The spot we have thought and dreamed
about but never before seen.</p>

<p>If any one should ask why we came,
hardly pausing, by so many mounds
of soldiers who died in the same
cause, as may be read on their tablets,
we would answer that, with the
soul of this one, all glory for us passed
out of our marvellous sunsets,
warmth from the color of our autumns,
charm from our ice-bound winters,
sweetness from the breath of
our springs.</p>

<p>Down there, bordering this field
consecrated to Catholic dead, is the
"colored folks' ground."</p>

<p>How tidy it looks. Formerly it
was a huddle of neglected hillocks;
many of them sunken as if they who,
deprecating scorn, had crept through
the world in the shadow of the wall,
shrank even here from obtruding.</p>

<p>How many of us Catholics, of the
thousands that crowd that church of
which we see the cross above the hill-top,
or lie here with hands crossed to
God, ever offered a prayer for those
neglected souls, living or dead?</p>

<p>Before that church was built there
came from the West Indies, following
the fortunes of an exiled family, a
gray-haired negro. He did not persevere
in hearing Mass because the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
children insulted him on the street&mdash;waited
for him with stones in their
hands at the corners of the church.
He died, and, to fulfil his last wish,
some of his people planted a cross
upon his unsodded grave.</p>

<p>I used to know every mound, from
that Egyptian-faced vault,</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Against whose portal I had thrown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In childhood, many an echoing stone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shrank to think, poor heart of sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was the dead that groaned within;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>to the cheerful nook where the nurseryman's
children sleep under their
coverlet of flowers. From the hero's
pillar by the highway, with the record,</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He lived as mothers wish their sons to live,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He died as fathers wish their sons to die,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>to the monument of the beloved woman
whose husband and daughters
came every year from distant homes
to add a tribute of plants and garlands
to the granite offering they
had raised to her memory.</p>

<p>Here, broken and half buried, is
the old slab with death's-head and
bones, and the verse exhorting all
Christians to pray for the soul of
Peter Curran.</p>

<p>Under this willow&mdash;she that planted
it, in the belief that it would shade
her rest, lies far away&mdash;our patriarch
is buried: a father to orphans; to
the poor a brother. That memorial
in the stranger's ground&mdash;the only
one&mdash;he caused to be placed above
the remains of the decayed gentleman
he entertained so many years
and laid to rest at his own cost. Another,
to whom he gave shelter, lies
beside "the chevalier." The droll
Swede, the whaleman, is buried behind
them both. In our village foreigners
were not looked upon with
favor in those ante-emigration times;
and this one was so blundering that
no one would give him work after his
honesty was proved. They were going
to send him to jail as a vagrant,
when Uncle Allan made up his mind
that he needed just such a man for
odd jobs. Bastian never learned
enough English to thank him, but
the tears that wet his parchment
cheeks the day they brought his benefactor
here were expressive.</p>

<p>Figures homely yet gracious, how
they rise in memory!</p>

<p>Some fell asleep in hope; others
drew back in doubt, or struggled
with doom. Some, having done their
best, lay down, offering it and that
wherein they had failed to God, beside
others who had nothing to offer
but remorse.</p>

<p>All these yet speak to us, with
more significance on this October
afternoon in the October of our life
than they did in past autumns; while
to every one, according to his need,
they teach a lesson.</p>

<p>They say to the covetous, "Not
one of your things shall pass through
the gate of this city."</p>

<p>To the envious, "Behold the state
of him you wished to change places
with yesterday."</p>

<p>They promise those who are kept
awake by care "a blessed sleep."</p>

<p>They speak of rest to the world-weary;
to the good, of beatitude; to
the bad, of judgment; to all, of the
end that is hastening on swift wings.</p>

<h2>FREE RELIGION.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></h2>


<p>This Free Religious Association
appears to be composed of men and
women who, some thirty years ago,
were, or would have been, called
<i>come-outers</i> in Boston and its vicinity,
but who are now generally called
radicals, a name which they seem
quite willing to accept. They are
universal agitators, and see or imagine
grievances everywhere, and
make it a point wherever they see
or can invent a grievance, to hit it;
at least, to strike at it. They were
conspicuous in the late abolition
movement, are strenuous advocates
for negro equality&mdash;or, rather, negro
superiority&mdash;stanch women's rights
men, in a word, reformers in general.
They claim to have a pure
and universal religion; and though
some of them are downright atheists,
they profess to be more Christian
than Christianity itself, and their aim
would seem to be to get rid of all
special religion, so as to have only
religion in general. They say, in the
first article of their constitution:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This association shall be called the
Free Religious Association&mdash;its objects being
to promote the interests of pure religion,
to encourage the scientific study of
theology, and to increase fellowship in the
spirit; and to this end all persons interested
in these objects are cordially invited to
its membership."</p></blockquote>

<p>Nothing can be fairer or broader,
so far as words go. Ordinary mortals,
however, may be puzzled to
make out what this religion in general,
and no religion in particular,
really is; and also to understand
how there can be pure religion and
scientific theology without God.
Our radical friends are not puzzled
at all. They have only to call
man God, and the scientific study
of the physiological and psychological
laws of human nature the scientific
study of theology, and every difficulty
vanishes. Whoever believes in
himself believes in God, and whoever
can stand poised on himself has in
himself the very essence of religion.
According to them, the great error of
the past has been in supposing that
religion consists in the recognition,
the love, and the service of a superior
power; but the merit of free religion is,
that it emancipates mankind from
this mother error, discards the notion
that they owe obedience to any
power above humanity, and teaches
that man is subject only to himself.
Hence the Emersonian maxim, Obey
thyself, which, translated into plain
English, is, Live as thou listest.</p>

<p>The aim of the association, the
president&mdash;whom we remember as a
handsome, fair-complexioned, bright-eyed
school-boy&mdash;tells us in his opening
address is Unity. He says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Our aim, let it be understood, is <em>unity</em>;
not division, discord, conflict&mdash;but unity.
We are not controversialists. We carry no
sword in our hands. We wear no weapons
concealed about our person. Our one word
is peace&mdash;the word which is always most
heartily responded to by earnest men. Religion
means unity; the very definition of it
signifies the power that binds men together;
that binds all souls to the divine. The communion
of saints&mdash;that is the religious
phrase; and yet you will pardon me if I say
that religion at present is the one word that
means division. As interpreted by the religious
world, it means war and discord.
Subjects are debated on other platforms&mdash;social
questions, political questions; they
are debated and dismissed. In the religious
world the discussion goes on more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
persistently, more bitterly than on any other
field; but the issues are always the same,
the venue is never changed, conclusions are
never reached, and we lack the benefit that
comes from the reconciliation of perpetual
discussion.</p>

<p>"Religion as organized is organized division.
The communion is a communion-table,
the Christ is a symbol of the sects, the
unity is a unity made up of separate departments
and families. The ancient religions
of the world still hold their own. Buddhism,
Brahminism, the religion of Zoroaster, the
religion of Confucius, Judaism, fetichism,
Sabaism&mdash;all stand where they did. All
gather in their population; all have their
organized activities, as they ever had. No
one of them has materially changed its
front; not one of them has been disorganized;
not one of them has retreated from the
ground that from time immemorial it has
occupied. They have stormed at each other,
they have been mortal enemies; but still
they stand where they stood. There is no
superstition, however degrading, that does
not exist to-day; and Christian missionaries,
Catholic and Protestant, have gone out
with hearts of flame and tongues of fire,
and souls that were all one solid single
piece of consecration, and have dashed
themselves in hosts with the utmost heroism
against those ancient lines of faith; and
their weapons have dropped harmless at
the foot. Here and there a few hundred, or
a few thousand, or a few tens or hundreds of
thousands, may have shifted from one faith
to the other; but the solid substance of
these great religions still endures. The
vast aggregates of millions and tens of millions
are unaffected. Christianity holds its
own, and no more. Buddhism and Brahminism
hold their own, and as much.
What shall we say to this? Does religion
mean unity? The world cannot be all of
one form of religion. Religion is deeper
than all its several forms. One religion
cannot dislodge another; one faith cannot
supplant another faith. Put Christianity in
the place of Brahminism and Buddhism,
and people would not be Christians. They
might change their name&mdash;they would not
change their nature. The inhabitants of
countries that have been under the sway of
those great faiths do not become Christian
men by becoming Christian peoples. The
Turks in European Turkey are better men
than the Greek Christians in European
Turkey. The religions, as such, must hold
their places essentially undisturbed. Harmony
is not possible at present on that
ground&mdash;on any sectarian ground.</p>

<p>"Christianity itself is a bundle of religions.
There is the vast Greek Church,
with its patriarchs; there is the enormous
Catholic Church, with its pope; here are
all the families of the Protestant Church,
with their clergy. They hold the same relative
position. Protestantism does not subdue
Romanism; Romanism will never subdue
Protestantism. The Protestant Church
and Roman Church have stood face to face
for centuries; and thus they will continue to
stand, as long as the populations have the
genius that God gave them. What is
Christendom but an army divided against
itself? What is Protestantism but a mingling
of warring sects?&mdash;each sect falling in
pieces the moment it becomes organized for
work. Unitarianism does not gain on Orthodoxy;
Orthodoxy does not gain on Unitarianism.
Each sect takes up the little
portion that belongs to it, and must rest
contented; and all the power of propagandism,
of sectarian zeal, of fire and earnestness,
does but cause the little flame to burn
up more brightly for an instant on the local
altar; and, when it dies down, the ashes remain
on that altar still.</p>

<p>"Our word, then, is Unity. But how
shall we get it? Not by becoming Catholics;
not by making another order of Protestants;
not by instituting another sect;
but by going down below all the sects&mdash;going
down to faith. For faith, hope, aspiration,
charity, love, worship, we believe, are
inherent, profound, indestructible elements
of human nature." (Pp. 7-9.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The rhetoric is not bad; but in
what does the unity aimed at consist,
and how is it to be obtained? Religion,
by the speakers who addressed
the association, is assumed to be a
sentiment, and faith and hope and
charity are, we are told, indestructible
elements of human nature; then
since human nature is one, what
unity can the free religionists aspire
to that they and all men have not
already, or have not always had?
Pass over this; whence and by what
means is the unity, whatever it consists
in, to be obtained? The answer
to this question is not very definite,
but it would seem the association expect
it from below, not from above;
for the president says, we are to obtain
it only by "going down below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
all sects&mdash;going down to faith." A
Catholic would have said, We attain
to unity only by rising above all sects,
to a faith which is one and universal,
and which the sects rend and divide
among themselves. But the radicals
have outgrown Catholicity, outgrown
Christianity, and very properly look
for faith and unity from below. But
when they get down, down to the lowest
deep, will they find them? What
faith or unity will they find in the
lowest depths of humanity in addition
to what all men have always
had? If, notwithstanding the unity
of nature, sects and divisions prevail,
and always have prevailed, how, with
nothing above nature or in addition
to it, do you expect to get rid of them,
and establish practical unity, or to
obtain the charity that springs from
unity?</p>

<p>The radicals deny that they are
destructives, that they have only negations,
or that they make war on
any existing church, religion, sect, or
denomination; they will pardon us,
then, if we are unable to conceive
what they mean by unity, or what unity,
except the physical unity of nature,
there is or can be among those who
divide on every subject in which they
feel any interest. Does the association
propose to get rid of diversity by indifference,
and of divisions simply
by bringing all men to agree to differ?
We certainly find only unity in denying
among the individuals associated,
who agree in nothing except that
each one holds himself or herself
alone responsible for his or her own
personal views and utterances. Some
of them would retain the Christian
name, and others would reject it.
Mr. Francis Ellingwood Abbott argues
that it is not honest to hold on
to the name after having rejected the
thing. By professing to be a Christian
a man binds himself to accept
Christianity; and whoso accepts Christianity,
binds himself to accept the
Catholic Church, which embodies and
expresses it. We make an extract
from his address:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As I look abroad in the community, I
see two extreme types of religious faith.
One is represented in the Roman Church,
the great principle of authority. That
church has been, and, I think, will always
be, the grandest and the greatest embodiment
of Christianity in social life. It is
worthy of profound respect; and I, for one,
yield it profound respect. It took an infidel,
Auguste Comte, to portray fairly the
service done to the world by the Christian
Church&mdash;the great Catholic Church&mdash;of the
middle ages; and we radicals are false to
our principles, if we do not do homage to
every thing that is great and good and serviceable
in its season, even although we
think its day of usefulness may have passed.
The fundamental principle of the Roman
Church is authority, pure and simple.
The theology of Rome carries that principle
out to the extremest degree. Its hierarchy
embodies it in an institution; and,
from beginning to end, from centre to periphery,
the Roman Catholic Church is consistent
with itself in the development of
that one idea in spiritual and social and ecclesiastical
life.</p>

<p>"At the other pole of human thought
and experience, I see a very few persons&mdash;indeed,
so few that I might, perhaps, almost
count them on the fingers of one hand&mdash;who
plant themselves on the principle of
liberty alone; who want nothing else; who
stand without dogma, without creed, without
priesthood, without Bible, without
Christ, without any thing but the Almighty
God working in their hearts. These two
principles of authority and freedom have
thus worked out for themselves, at last,
consistent expression. Here are the two extremes&mdash;Romish
Christianity and free religion;
and between these two extremes we
see a compromise, Protestant Christianity&mdash;the
compromise between Catholicism and
free religion. Every compromise is weak,
because it contains conflicting elements.
Protestant Christianity is like the image
with head of gold and feet of clay. It cannot
stand for ever. Either Christianity, as
embodied in the Roman Church, is right,
or else free religion is right. Have we not
learned yet to give up these combinations
of opposites, contraries, and incompatibles?
Has the war taught us nothing? Are we
still trying to make some chimerical mixture,
some impossible union of freedom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and slavery? I trust not. For my own
part, I stand pledged to liberty, pure and
simple; and I have come to view all compromises
alike, and to cast them utterly
away, whether they clothe themselves in the
garments of Geneva, or in the last expression
of Dr. Bellows and the Unitarian
Church." (Pp. 32-33.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Abbott is not quite exact in
his phraseology, and does not state
the Catholic principle correctly. The
principle on which the church rests,
and out of which grow all her doctrines
and precepts, is not authority,
but the mystery of the Incarnation,
or the assumption of human nature
by the Word. Nor is he himself
quite honest according to his own
test of honesty. To be consistent
with himself, he must reject not only
the term <em>Christian</em>, but also the term <em>religion</em>,
and put the alternative, Either
Catholicity or no religion. The word
religion&mdash;from <i>religare</i>&mdash;means either
intensively to bind more firmly, or
iteratively, to bind again, to bind
man morally to God as his last end,
in addition to his being physically
bound to God as his first cause.
<em>Free religion</em> is a contradiction in
terms, as much so as free bondage.
Religion is always a bond, a law that
binds.</p>

<p>Ralph Waldo Emerson differs from
Mr. Abbott, and would retain the
name Christian, though without the
reality. We quote a long passage
from his not very remarkable speech,
out of deference to his rank as one
of the originators of the movement:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We have had, not long since, presented
to us by Max Müller a valuable paragraph
from St. Augustine, not at all extraordinary
in itself, but only as coming from
that eminent father in the church, and at
that age in which St. Augustine writes:
'That which is now called the Christian religion
existed among the ancients, and never
did not exist from the planting of the
human race until Christ came in the flesh,
at which time the true religion, which already
subsisted, began to be called Christianity.'
I believe that not only Christianity
is as old as the creation&mdash;not only every
sentiment and precept of Christianity can
be paralleled in other religious writings&mdash;but
more, that a man of religious susceptibility,
and one at the same time conversant with
many men&mdash;say a much travelled man&mdash;can
find the same idea in numberless conversations.
The religious find religion
wherever they associate. When I find in
people narrow religion, I find also in them
narrow reading.</p>

<p>"I object, of course, to the claim of
miraculous dispensation&mdash;certainly not to
the doctrine of Christianity. This claim
impairs, to my mind, the soundness of him
who makes it, and indisposes us to his communion.
This comes the wrong way; it
comes from without, not within. This positive,
historical, authoritative scheme is not
consistent with our experience or our expectations.
It is something not in nature, it is
contrary to that law of nature which all wise
men recognized, namely, never to require a
larger cause than is necessary to the effect.
George Fox, the Quaker, said that, though
he read of Christ and God, he knew them
only from the like spirit in his own soul.
We want all the aids to our moral training.
We cannot spare the vision nor the virtue
of the saints; but let it be by pure sympathy,
not with any personal or official claim.
If you are childish and exhibit your saint
as a worker of wonders, a thaumaturgist, I
am repelled. That claim takes his teachings
out of logic and out of nature, and
permits official and arbitrary senses to be
grafted on the teachings. It is the praise
of our New Testament that its teachings
go to the honor and benefit of humanity&mdash;that
no better lesson has been taught or
incarnated. Let it stand, beautiful and
wholesome, with whatever is most like it in
the teaching and practice of men; but do
not attempt to elevate it out of humanity
by saying, 'This was not a man,' for then
you confound it with the fables of every
popular religion; and my distrust of the
story makes me distrust the doctrine as
soon as it differs from my own belief.
Whoever thinks a story gains by the prodigious,
by adding something out of nature,
robs it more than he adds. It is no longer
an example, a model; no longer a heart-stirring
hero, but an exhibition, a wonder,
an anomaly, removed out of the range of
influence with thoughtful men." (Pp. 42-44.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Emerson cannot be very deeply
read in patristic literature, if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
is obliged to go to Max Müller for a
quotation from St. Augustine, and he
proves by his deductions from the
language of this great doctor and father
that he knows little of the Catholic
Church. St. Augustine was a
Catholic, and taught that, though
times vary, faith does not vary, and
that as believed the patriarchs so believe
we, only they believed in the
Christ who was to come, and we in
the Christ who has come; and the
church teaches through her doctors
that there has been only one revelation,
that this was made, in substance,
to our first parents in the garden.
She teaches us that Christianity is not
only as old, but even older than creation;
for creation with all it contains
was created in reference to Christ the
Incarnate Word, and consequently
Christianity, founded in the Incarnation,
is really the supreme law according
to which the universe was created
and exists. It precedes all other
religions, and the various heathen or
pagan religions and mythologies are
only traditions, corruptions, perversions,
or travesties of it. To the
question, "How is the church catholic?"
the very child's catechism
answers, "Because she subsists in all
ages, teaches all nations, and maintains
all truth." How otherwise
could she be Catholic?</p>

<p>That "every sentiment [doctrine?]
and precept of Christianity can be
paralleled in other religious writings"
(religions, for Christianity is not a
writing) may be true in part, if taken
separately and in an unchristian
sense; but certainly not as a connected
and self-consistent system, in
its unity and integrity. But suppose
it, what then? It would only prove
that all religions have retained more
or less of the primitive revelation,
which all men held in common before
the Gentile apostasy and the
dispersion of the race consequent on
the attempt to build the Tower of
Babel; not that all religions have
had a common origin in human nature.
What we actually find in pagan
religions and mythologies that is
like Christianity, is no more than we
should expect on the supposition of
a primitive revelation held out of
unity, and interpreted by pride, folly,
and ignorance, the characteristics of
every pagan people. But Mr. Emerson
is true to the old doctrine which
he chanted years ago in <cite>The Dial</cite>:</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Out from the heart of nature rolled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The burdens of the Bible old;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The litanies of nations came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the volcano's tongue of flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up from the burning core below&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The canticles of love and woe."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Nothing can roll out of the heart of
nature but nature itself; and hence,
in order to derive Christianity from
within, Mr. Emerson eliminates whatever
is supernatural and external and
reduces it to simple nature, which
every man from the beginning to the
end of the world carries within him,
and of which he cannot divest himself.
He unchristianizes Christianity,
makes it an element of human nature,
confounds it with the natural
laws of the physicists, and then tells
us it is as old as creation, which is
about as much as telling us man is as
old as&mdash;man, or nature is as old as&mdash;nature.
Well may Mr. Emerson be
called the Sage of Concord, and be
listened to as an oracle.</p>

<p>All the speakers, with three exceptions,
seemed anxious to have it understood
that the Free Religious Association
has some great affirmative
truth which is destined to redeem
and save the world. Colonel Higginson,
the successor of Theodore Parker,
tells us with great earnestness:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If this movement of ours means any
thing, it means not a little petty denial, not
a little criticism, not a textual discussion,
not a sum in addition or subtraction, like
Bishop Colenso's books, not a bit of historical
analysis, like Strauss or Renan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
These are trivial things; these do not
touch people; these do not reach the universal
heart. The universe needs an affirmation,
not a denial; and the religious
movement that has not for its centre the
assertion of something, would be condemned
already to degenerate into a sect by the
time it had the misfortune to get fairly
born." (P. 58.)</p></blockquote>

<p>And again:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Affirmation! There is no affirmation
except the belief in universal natural religion;
all else is narrowness and sectarianism,
though it call itself by the grandest
name, compared with that. It impoverishes
a man; it keeps his sympathy in one
line of religious communication; it takes
all the spiritual life of the race, and says,
'All of this that was not an effluence from
Jesus you must set aside;' and so it makes
you a member in full standing of some little
sect, all of whose ideas, all of whose
thoughts, revolved in the mind of some one
narrow-minded theologian who founded it.
It shuts you up there, and you die, suffocated
for want of God's free air outside."
(P. 59.)</p></blockquote>

<p>But the reverend colonel here
affirms nothing not affirmed by
Christianity, nor any thing more than
belongs to all men. Natural religion
is simply the natural law, the moral
law, prescribed to every man through
his reason by the end for which he is
created, and is included in the Christian
religion as essential to the Christian
character. What the free religionist
does is not to affirm any thing
not universally insisted on by the
Catholic Church, but to deny all religion
but universal natural religion;
that is, he simply denies supernatural
revelation, and the supernatural order,
or that there is any reality broader than
nature or above it. Free religion, as
such, is, then, not affirmative, but purely
negative; the negation of all religions
in so far as they assert the supernatural.
The real thought and design
of the men and women composing the
association is to get rid of every thing
in every religion that transcends or
professes to transcend nature. They
make no direct war on the church or
even on the sects, we concede; for
they take it for granted that when
people are once fully persuaded that
nature is all, and that only natural
religion is or can be true, all else will
gradually die out of itself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lucy Stone agrees in this
with the others, and does not disguise
her thought. She says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We come into the world, I believe,
every one of us, with all that is needful in
ourselves, if we will only trust it&mdash;all that
is needful to help us on and up to the very
highest heights to which a human being
can ever climb; but we have covered it
over by dogma and creed and sectarian
theory, and by our own misdeeds, until
these angel voices that are in us cease to
be heard; not totally cease&mdash;I do not believe
they ever totally cease&mdash;but they become
less and less audible to us. But if we
learn to heed their faintest whisper, reverently
and obediently, I believe that there
is no path where the soul asks you to go
that you may not safely tread. It may carry
you to the burning, fiery furnace, but you
will come out, and the smell of fire even
will not be on your garments. It may
compel you into the lion's den, but the wild
beast's mouth will be shut. You may walk
where scorpions are in the way of duty, and
you will not be hurt. It is this 'inner light;'
it is not a text, it is not a creed, but it is this
in ourselves which, if trusted, will lead us

<p>"I said I did not believe this voice was
ever lost in the human soul. I do not
forget that men grow very wicked, and
women too, for that matter; I do not
forget that men and women sometimes appear
to us so lost and fallen that it seems
as if no power in themselves, or any human
power, could help them up; and yet to
these worst, men and women, in some hallowed
moment, is the word given, 'This is
the way: walk ye in it.' And if, at the
side of this man or woman, at that very
moment, is some helping hand, some voice
wise enough to counsel, he or she may be
started to walk in that way." (P. 100.)</p></blockquote>

<p>If Mr. Abbott is the logician of the
association, Mrs. Julia Ward Howe
is decidedly the wit. In the essay
she read to the meeting she, with
her keen woman's wit and her hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
common sense, shows up in admirable
style the ridiculousness and absurdity
of the whole movement.
She is not herself indeed free from all
taint of radicalism, and much she
says may be due to her facility in detecting
and satirizing the follies and
absurdities of her friends rather than
those of her foes; but her essay
proves that she has a soul, and
knows that it has aspirations that go
beyond nature, and wants which only
a supernatural religion can satisfy.
She evidently has glimpses of a truth
higher, deeper, broader, than any recognized
by any other radical who
spoke. She disposes of free religion
in a single sentence, "He is
not religious who does not recognize
the <em>obligations</em> of religion." We have
space only for the concluding paragraph
of her not very logical, self-consistent,
but witty, shrewd, and
satirical essay on <i>Freedom and Restraint
in Religion</i>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"But, friends, a sudden reaction comes
over me. I determine to profess and practise
the new religion. I have learned at
the free religious club that I possess the
first requisite for this, having never studied
any theology at all. The ex-divines whom
I have met there have so bewailed the artificial
ignorance which they acquired in
their divinity-school training, that I presume
my natural knowledge to be its proper
and desired antithesis. I have read
the Bhavadgheeta and Mr. Emerson's
poems, the psalms and gospel of the new
faith. To be no Christian is the next important
desideratum; and I believe that I
shall find this, as most people do, easier
than not. My first rule will be, 'Brahmins,
beware of intercourse with Pariahs!' The
three hundred incarnations of Vishnu, far
more imposing in number than the single
excarnation of which the old theology has
made so much, shall be preached by me
both as precept and example. The Confucian
moralities, as illustrated by Californian
experience, shall replace the Decalogue.
Mr. Emerson's crowning sentence, that he
who commits a crime hurts himself, will,
of course, suffice to convert a whole society
of criminals and reprobates. I will introduce
the Joss into prisons, and give the
myth of the Celestial Empire a literal interpretation.
Our railroad and steamboat
system will greatly facilitate the offering of
children to the river, with the further advantage
of offering the parents too. The
strangling of female infants will relieve the
present excess of female population in New
England, and postpone the pressure of woman
suffrage. The burning of widows
alone will save the country no small outlay
in pensions. Lastly, since the Turkish ethics
are coming so much into favor, I should
advise a more than Mormon application of
them in our midst. Coöperative housekeeping
could then be begun on the most
immediate and harmonious footing. And so
we will reconvert and transreform, and true
progress shall consist in regress.</p>

<p>"But, as Archimedes asked to get out of
the world in order to move it, we shall be
forced to go outside of Christendom in
order to accomplish this revolution. And
if I may believe my friends of the Free Religious
Association, the surest way to do
this will be to keep closely in their midst.
For, elsewhere, between steamboats and
missionaries, we cannot be sure of meeting
people who shall be sure of not being
Christians.</p>

<p>"Perish the jest, and let the jester perish,
if in aught but saddest earnest she exchanged
the serious for the comic mask.
Laughter is sometimes made to convey pathos
that lies too deep for tears. I have
but faintly sketched the scene-painting that
would have to be done to-day, if religion
could slip back and miss the sacred and
indispensable mediation of Christianity.
Take back the English language beyond
the noble building of Shakespeare and
Milton; take back philosophy beyond the
labor of the Germans and the intuition of
the Greeks; take back mathematics beyond
Laplace and Newton; take back politics
from the enlargement of republican
experience&mdash;you will have yet a harder
task when you shall carry religion back to
its ante-Christian status and interpretation.</p>

<p>"Lastly, and to sum up. The freedom
of religion is the satisfaction of obeying the
innermost and highest impulses of the human
soul, to the disregard of all secondary
powers and considerations. I find this
freedom inseparable from the constraint
which obliges the man toward this highest
effort, as the laws of the tidal flow force the
wave to high-water mark. Our human
dignity consists in the assertion of this freedom,
the acknowledgment of this obligation.
Intellectual freedom is found in study
and the progress of thought, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
ever substituting enlarged and improved
for rude and narrow processes. But the
liberal heart precedes the liberal mind, and
conditions it. To be careless as to authority
and rash in conclusions, is not to be free;
to be strict in logic and scrupulous in derivation,
is not to be unfree. Let me end
my discursive remarks with one phrase
from a dear, melancholy, Calvinistic poet,
who passed his life in damning himself and
blessing others, repenting of a thousand sins
he was never able to commit:</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">And all are slaves beside.'"<br /></span>

<p>A stranger, who gave his name as
Gustave Watson, made a brief, modest,
sensible speech, which fully refuted
the radical pretensions. He told
them that he had listened in vain to
hear pronounced the great affirmative
truth the speakers professed to
have. An evangelical minister, a
Rev. Jesse H. Jones, took up the defence
of Christianity, but was too
ignorant of the Christian faith, and
too far gone himself in radicalism, to
be able to effect much. He took up
the weakest line of defence possible,
and labored chiefly to show the novelty
of Christianity against St. Augustine,
and its identity, under one
of its aspects, with carnal Judaism
or modern socialism. An orthodox
Jew sent an essay and a liberal Jew
spoke. A professor of spiritism made
a speech, and several radicals spoke
whose speeches we are obliged to
pass over, though as good as those we
have noticed.</p>

<p>We have refrained as far as possible
from ridiculing the proceedings
of the association, which is no association
at all, since it is founded on
the principle of free individualism;
for we wish to treat all men and women
with the respect due to ourselves,
if not to themselves. The
chief actors in the movement we
have formerly known, and some of
them intimately. We have no doubt
of their sincerity and earnestness; but
we must be permitted to say that we
have found nothing new or striking
in their speeches, and we cannot
remember the time when we were
not perfectly familiar with all their doctrines
and pretensions. Their views
and aims were set forth in the New
England metropolis nearly forty years
ago, if with less mental refinement
and polish, with an originality and
freshness, a force and energy, which
they can hardly hope to rival. They
were embodied in 1836, and attempted
to be realized in the Society for
Christian Union and Progress, which
its founder abandoned because he
would not suffer it to grow into a
sect, because he saw his movement
was leading no whither, and could
accomplish nothing for the glory of
God or the good of mankind here or
hereafter, and because, through the
grace and mercy of God, he became
convinced of the truth and sanctity
of the Catholic Church against which
the Protestant reformers in the sixteenth
century rebelled. He may
not now be very proud of these radicals,
but they are, to a great extent,
the product of a movement of which
he and Ralph Waldo Emerson were
the earliest and principal leaders in
Boston.</p>

<p>We readily acknowledge that the
pretensions of these radical men and
women are very great, but they show
no great intellectual ability, and are
painfully narrow and superficial.
The ministers and ex-ministers who
figured on the occasion exhibited
neither depth nor breadth of view,
neither strength nor energy of mind.
They proved themselves passable
rhetoricians, but deplorably ignorant
of the past and the present, of the
religions they believed themselves to
have outgrown, and especially of
human nature and the wants of the
human soul. They appeared to
know only their own theories projected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
from themselves, and which are as
frail and as attenuated as any spider's
web ever rendered visible by the
morning dew. They pretend to have
studied, mastered, and exhausted all
the past systems, religions, and mythologies;
they pride themselves on the
universality of their knowledge, and
their having lost all bigotry, intolerance,
or severity toward any
sect or denomination. They speak
even patronizingly of the church,
and are quite ready to concede that
she was good and useful to humanity
in her day, in barbarous times, and
in the infancy of the race; but humanity,
having attained its majority,
has outgrown her, and demands now
a more manly and robust, a purer
and broader and a more living and
life-giving religion&mdash;a religion, in a
word, more Christian than Christianity,
more Catholic than Catholicity.
Ignorant or worse than ignorant of
the lowest elements of Catholic
teaching, they fancy they have outgrown
it, as the adult man has outgrown
the garments of his childhood.
Their self-conceit is sublime. Why,
they are not large enough to wear
the fig-leaf aprons fabricated by the
reformers of the sixteenth century
with which to cover their nakedness.
The tallest and stoutest among them
is a dwarf by the side of a Luther or
a Calvin, or even of the stern old Puritan
founders of New England; nay,
they cannot bear an intellectual comparison
even with the originators of
New England Unitarianism.</p>

<p>Take the Reverend Colonel Higginson,
a man of good blood and rich
natural gifts, one who, if he had been
trained in a Christian school, and had
had his mind elevated and expanded
by the study of Christian dogmata,
could hardly have failed to be one of
the great men, if not the greatest
man of his age. He has naturally
true nobility of soul, rare intellectual
power, and genius of a high order;
yet he is so blinded, and so dwarfed
in mind by his radicalism, that he can
seriously say, "There is no affirmation
except the belief in universal natural
religion; all else is narrowness
and sectarianism." He has, then, no
views broader than nature, no aspirations
that rise higher than nature,
and labors under the delusion that
men, reduced to nature alone, would
really be elevated and ennobled.
He has never learned that nature
is not self-sufficing&mdash;is dependent;
that it has both its origin and end
as well as its medium in the supernatural,
and could not act or subsist
a moment without it&mdash;a truth
which the Catholic child has learned
before a dozen years old, and which
is a simple commonplace with the
Christian; so much so, that he rarely
thinks it necessary to assert it, far
less to prove it.</p>

<p>This utterance of the reverend
colonel is accepted by all the radicals.
None of them get above second
causes; for them all God and nature
appear to be identical and indistinguishable;
and this appears to
be their grand and all-reconciling
doctrine. Hence the religion which
they propose has no higher origin
than man, and no higher end than
the natural development and well-being
of man, individual and social,
in this earthly life. It is the religion
of humanity, not the religion of God,
and man, not God, is obeyed and worshipped
in it; yet it seems never to occur
to these wise men and women that
nature either separated from or identified
with God vanishes into nothing,
and their religion with it. But is a
religion that is simply evolved from
humanity, that has no element above
the human, and is necessarily restricted
to man in this life, and that contemplates
neither fore nor after, higher,
deeper, and more universal than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Christianity which asserts for us the
nature and essence of God, teaches us
the origin and end of all things, the real
relations of man to his Maker and to
universal nature through all the degrees
and stages of his existence?
No; it is your naturism that is "narrowness
and sectarianism."</p>

<p>Radicalism has heard of the mystery
of the Incarnation, and interprets
it to mean not the union of two
for ever distinct natures, the divine
and human, in one divine person,
but one divine nature in all human
persons. Hence, while the person is
human, circumscribed, and transitory,
nature in all men is divine, is God
himself, permanent, universal, infinite,
immortal. This is what the Christian
mystery, according to them, really
means, though the ignorant, narrow-minded,
and blundering apostles never
knew it, never understood its profound
significance. The church took the
narrow and shallow view of the apostles;
and hence our radicals have outgrown
the church, and instead of
looking back or without, above or
beyond themselves, they look only
within, down into their own divine
nature, whence emanates the universe,
and in which is all virtue, all
good, all truth, all force, all reality.
The aim of all moral and religious discipline
must be to get rid of all personal
distinction, all circumscription, and
to sink all individuality in the divine
nature, which is the real man, the
"one man," the "over-soul" of which
Mr. Emerson in his silvery tones formerly
discoursed so eloquently and
captivated so many charming Boston
girls, who understood him by sympathy
with their hearts, not their heads,
though what he said seemed little
better than transcendental nonsense
to the elder, graver, and less susceptible
of both sexes. Impersonal nature
is divine; hence the less of persons
we are the more divine we are, and
the more we act from the promptings
of impersonal nature the more god-like
our acts. Hence instinct, which
is impersonal, is a safer guide than
reason, which is personal; the logic
of the heart is preferable to the logic
of the head, and fools and madmen
superior to the wise and the sane.
Hence, are fools and madmen profoundly
reverenced by Turks and
Arabs.</p>

<p>But impersonal nature is one and
identical in all men, and identical,
too, with the divine nature. There
are no distinct, specific, or individual
natures; there is only one nature in
all men and things; for all individuality,
all difference or distinction, is
in the personality. Hence when you
get rid of personality, which, after all,
has no real subsistence, and sink back
into impersonal nature, you attain at
once to absolute unity, always and
ever present under all the diversity
of beliefs, views, or persons. Men and
women are mere bubbles floating on
the face of the ocean, and nothing
distinguishes them from the ocean
underlying them but their bubbleosity.
Destroy that, and they are the
ocean itself. Get rid of personality,
sink back into impersonal nature, and
all men and women become one, and
identical in the one universal nature.
Vulgar radicals and reformers seek to
reform society by laboring to ameliorate
the condition of men and women
as persons, and are less profitably
employed than the boy blowing
soap-bubbles; for the reality is in the
ocean on the face of which the bubble
floats, not in the bubbleosity.
The true radicals, who radicalize in
satin slippers and kid gloves, seek not
to ameliorate the bubbleosity which
is unreal, an unveracity, a mere apparition,
a sense-show, but to ameliorate
man and society by sinking it,
and all differences with it, in universal
impersonal nature.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet what amelioration is possible
except personal? If you get rid of
men and women as persons, you annihilate
them in every sense in which
they are distinguishable from the one
universal nature; and suppose you to
succeed in doing it, your reform, your
amelioration would be the annihilation
of man and society; for you can
have neither without men and women
as individuals&mdash;that is, as persons.
To reform or ameliorate them in their
impersonal nature is both impossible
and unnecessary; for in their impersonal
nature they are identical with universal
nature, and universal nature is
God, infinite, immutable, immortal,
incapable of being augmented or diminished.
Nothing can be done for or
against impersonal nature. We see,
then, nothing that these refined and
accomplished radicals can propose as
the object of their labors but the
making of all men and women, as
far as possible, talk and act like fools
and madmen. This would seem to be
their grand discovery, and the proof
of their having outgrown the church.</p>

<p>But we should be ourselves the
fool and madman if we attempted
to reason with them. They discard
logic, reject reason, and count the
understanding as one of the poorest
of our faculties; as mean, narrow,
personal. Reason and understanding
are personal; and all truth,
all knowledge, all wisdom, all that
is real is impersonal. Is not the
impersonality of God, that is, of
nature, a primary article of their
creed? How, then, reason with
them or expect them to listen to
the voice of reason? Reason is too
strait for them, and they have outgrown
it, as they have outgrown the
church! They do not even pretend
to be logically consistent with themselves.
No one holds himself bound
by his own utterances, any more than
he does by the utterances of another.
They are free religionists, and scorn
to be bound even by the truth.</p>

<p>But suppose they wish to retain
men and women&mdash;or women and men,
for with them woman is the superior&mdash;as
persons, how do they expect by
restricting, as they do, their knowledge
to this life, and making their
happiness consist in the goods of
this world alone, to effect their individual
amelioration? Socialism secures
always its own defeat. The
happiness of this life is attainable
only by living for another. Restricted
to this life and this world, man has
play for only his animal instincts,
propensities, and powers. There is
no object on which his higher or
peculiarly human affections and faculties
can be exerted, and his moral,
religious, rational nature must stagnate
and rot, or render him unspeakably
miserable by his hungering and thirsting
after a spiritual good which he
has not, and which is nowhere to be
had. The happiness of this life
comes from living for a supernatural
end, the true end of man, in obedience
to the law it prescribes. When
we make this life or this world our
end, or assume, with Mr. Emerson,
that we have it within, in our own
impersonal nature, we deny the very
condition of either individual or social
happiness, take falsehood for
truth; and no good ever does or can
come from falsehood.</p>

<p>It will be observed by our readers,
from the extracts we have made, that
the radicals not only confine their
views to humanity and to this life, but
proceed on the assumption of the sufficiency
of man's nature for itself. They
appear to have, with the exception
of Mrs. Howe, no sense of the need
of any supernatural help. They
have no sense of the incompleteness
and insufficiency of nature, as they
have no compassion for its weakness.
They never stumble, never fall, never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
sin, are never baffled, are never in
need of assistance. It is not so with
ordinary mortals. We find nature insufficient
for us, our own strength inadequate;
and, voyaging over the
stormy ocean of life, we are often
wrecked, and compelled to cry out in
agony of soul, "Lord, save or we
perish." Whosoever has received any
religious instruction knows that it is
not in ourselves but in God that we
live and move and have our being,
and that not without supernatural assistance
can we attain true beatitude.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we may say, these
radical men and women set forth
nothing not familiar to us before the
late Theodore Parker was an unfledged
student of the Divinity School, Cambridge,
and even before most of them
were born. We know their views
and aims better than they themselves
know them, and we have lived long
enough to learn that they are narrow
and superficial, false and vain. We
have in the church the freedom we
sighed for but found not, and which
is not to be found, in radicalism. God
is more than man, more than nature,
and never faileth; Christ the God-man,
at once perfect God and perfect
man, two distinct natures in one divine
person, is the way, the truth,
and the life; and out of him there is
no salvation, no true life, no beatitude.
We do not expect these radicals
to believe us; they are worshippers
of man and nature, and joined
to their idols. Esteeming themselves
wise, they become fools; ever learning,
they are never able to come to the
knowledge of the truth, any more than
the child is able to grasp the rainbow.</p>

<h2>MEMENTO MORI.</h2>


<p class="center">"Come and see how a Christian can die."&mdash;<i>Addison to his step-son.</i></p>

<p>We read that the celebrated Montaigne
wished to make a compilation
of remarkable death-bed scenes; for,
as he said, "he who should teach
men how to die would teach them
how to live." It may not be unprofitable
for us to recall the last moments
of some who have died in the
Catholic Church. It may give us
some new idea of the power of faith
to sustain the soul in that supreme
moment, and show us in what a super-eminent
degree the spirit of the
church fits one for the last great
change, and fortifies him to meet it
hopefully if not triumphantly. Let
us, then, in this month, consecrated by
so many pious Catholic hearts to the
memory of the dead, draw around
the death-beds of some who are remarkable
in various ways, and see if
we would not have our last end like
theirs. There is a horrid curiosity, if
no higher feeling, which attracts us to
the side of the dying, "to observe
their words, their actions, and what
sort of countenance they put upon
it." It is as if we would read the
final conflict of the soul, obtain some
new insight into the great mystery
of death, and perhaps catch some
glimpse of what awaits us beyond its
shadows. Even the unbeliever at
such a moment, forced to reflect on
the destiny of the soul, exclaims,
"Soul, what art thou? Flame that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
devourest me, wilt thou live after me?
Must thou suffer still? Mysterious
guest, what wilt thou become? Seekest
thou to reunite thyself to the great
flame of day? Perhaps from this fire
thou art only a spark, only a wandering
ray which that star recalls. Perhaps,
ceasing to exist when man dies, thou
art only a moisture more pure than the
animated dust the earth has produced."
The mind thus excited to
doubt and question is already on
the road to conviction. To see how
a good man meets his fate, is a lesson
of heavenly love which fastens itself
in the memory; the words that consoled
him and that he uttered sink
into the heart, perhaps to diffuse
light when our own time comes.</p>

<p>If Addison found nothing more
imposing, nothing more affecting, than
accounts of the last moments of the
dying; if the great Montaigne loved
the most minute details respecting
them, we need not turn with repugnance
from what we have a vital interest
in, and what may give us
some new idea of the blessing of dying
in the arms of our Holy Mother
the Church, fortified by her sacraments
and sustained by her spirit. The
French historian Anquetil, in giving
an account of the death of Montmorenci,
says, "It is instructive for persons
of all conditions in life to witness
the death of a great man who
unites noble sentiments with Christian
humility." It is true Dr. Johnson
says, "It matters not how a man
dies, but how he lives;" but a holy
death is generally the crown of a
good life, though "there are dark,
dark deaths which even the saints
have died, the aspect of whose
brightness was all turned heavenward,
so we could not see it."<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>I do not believe that "there is more
or less of affectation in every death-bed
scene." Young, rather, is right:</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A death-bed's a detector of the heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here tired dissimulation drops her mask<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through life's grimace, that mistress of the scene!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Father Faber says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Every Christian death-bed is a world&mdash;a
complete world&mdash;of graces, interferences,
compensations, lights, struggles, victories,
supernatural gestures, and the action of
grand spiritual laws. Each death-bed, explained
to us as God could explain it,
would be in itself an entire science of God&mdash;a
summa of the most delicate theology.
The varieties of grace in the individual soul
are so many infinities of the one infinite life
of God. No two deaths are quite alike.
The most delicate shades of difference between
one death and another would probably
disclose to us more of the ways of God,
and more of the capabilities of the soul
than philosophy has ever taught. Some
deaths are so beautiful that they can hardly
be recognizable for punishments. Such
was the death of St. Joseph, with his head
pillowed on the lap of Jesus. The twilight
bosom of Abraham was but a dull place
compared with the house of Nazareth
which the eyes of Jesus lighted. Such was
Mary's death, the penalty of which was rather
in its delay. It was a soft extinction,
through the noiseless flooding of her heart
with divine love. As nightingales are said
to have sung themselves to death, so Simeon
died, not of the sweet weariness of
his long watching, but of the fulness of his
contentment, of the satisfaction of his desires,
of the very new youth of soul which the
touch of the Eternal Child had infused into
his age, and, breaking forth into music
which heaven itself might envy and could
not surpass, he died with his world-soothing
song upon his lips&mdash;a song so sunset-like
that one might believe all the beauty
of all earth's beautiful evenings since creation
had gone into it to fill it full of peaceful
spells. Age after age shall take up the
strain. All the poetry of Christian weariness
is in it. It gives a voice to the heavenly
detachment and unworldliness of
countless saints. It is the heart's evening
light after the working hours of the day to
millions and millions of believers. The very
last compline that the church shall sing, before
the midnight when the doom begins and
the Lord breaks out upon the darkness from
the refulgent east, shall overflow with the
melodious sweetness of Simeon's pathetic
song."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus do our words&mdash;even dying
words&mdash;go on vibrating for ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>How many have died like St. Oswald,
Archbishop of York, and the
Venerable Bede, repeating the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gloria
Patri</i>&mdash;that act of praise which
St. Jerome found in constant use
among the oriental monks, and was
the means of introducing it into the
western church, where it is now daily
repeated by countless tongues.</p>

<p>St. Ignatius Loyola died with the
holy name of Jesus on his lips, that
watchword of his glorious order so
full of sweetness to the heart. So
did that angelic youth, St. Aloysius.
St. Hubert died repeating the Lord's
Prayer; St. Stephen of Grandmont
while saying, "Into thy hands, O
Lord, I commend my spirit." So
did St. John of the Cross, St. Catharine
of Genoa, and hundreds of
others.</p>

<p>St. Arsenius, after more than fifty
years spent in the desert, regarded
death with fear. His brethren, seeing
him weep in his agony, asked
him if, like other men, he feared to
die. "I am seized with great fear,"
he answered, "nor has this dread
ever left me since I first came into
the desert." Nevertheless, he expired,
in peace and humble confidence,
in his ninety-fifth year.</p>

<p>St. John Chrysostom, when dying,
had all his clothes changed, even to
his shoes, putting on his best garments,
which were white, as for his
heavenly nuptials; for "to one who
loves," says Novalis, "death is a
mystery of sweet mysteries&mdash;it is a
bridal night." He then received the
blessed sacrament and prayed, ending
according to his custom, with,
"Glory be to God for all things."
Then making the sign of the cross,
he gave up his soul.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>We read of the poet-monk Cædmon,
"That tongue, which had composed
so many holy words in praise
of the Creator, uttered its last words
while he was in the act of signing
himself with the cross, and thus he
fell into a slumber to awaken in paradise
and join in the hymns of the
holy angels whom he had imitated
in this world, both in his life and in
his songs."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>The account of the death of the
Venerable Bede is well known, but it
is one that can always be read again
and again with renewed profit, and
never without emotion.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"About a fortnight before the feast of
Easter," says his disciple Cuthbert, "he
was reduced to a state of great debility, with
difficulty of breathing, but without much
pain, and in that condition he lasted till the
day of the Lord's Ascension. This time he
passed cheerfully and joyfully, giving thanks
to Almighty God both by day and night, or
rather at all hours of the day and night. He
continued to give lessons to us daily, spending
the rest of his time in psalmody, and the
night also in joy and thanksgiving, unless
he were interrupted by a short sleep; and
yet, even then, the moment he awaked he
began again, and never ceased, with outstretched
hands, to return thanks to God.
I can declare with truth that I never saw
with my eyes, nor heard with my ears, of
any man who was so indefatigable in giving
thanks to the living God.</p>

<p>"O truly happy man! He chanted the
passage from the blessed Apostle Paul, 'It
is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of
the living God,' and several other passages
from Holy Writ, warning us to throw off all
torpor of soul, in consideration of our last
hour. And being conversant with Anglo-Saxon
poetry, he repeated several passages
and composed the following lines in our
tongue:</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Before the need-fare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None becometh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of thought more wise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than is his need.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To search out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere his going hence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What his spirit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For good or evil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After his death-day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doomed may be.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He also chanted the antiphons according
to his and our custom. One of these is, 'O
King of glory, Lord of hosts, who on this
day didst ascend in triumph above all the
heavens, leave us not orphans, but send
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
upon us the Spirit of truth, the promised of
the Father. Alleluia.' When he came to
the words 'leave us not orphans,' he burst
into tears and wept much; and after a while
he resumed where he had broken off, and
we who heard him wept with him. We
wept and studied by turns; or rather wept
all the time that we studied.</p>

<p>"Thus we passed in joy the quinquagesimal
days till the aforesaid festival, and he
rejoiced greatly, and gave thanks to God for
the infirmities under which he suffered, often
repeating, 'God scourgeth every son
whom he receiveth,' with other passages of
Scripture, and the saying of St. Ambrose,
'I have not lived so as to be ashamed to
live among you; nor do I fear to die, for we
have a gracious God.'</p>

<p>"During these days, beside the lessons
which he gave us, and the chant of the
psalms, he undertook the composition of
two memorable works; that is, he translated
into our language the Gospel of St. John
as far as 'But what are those among so
many?' [St. John vi. 9,] and made a collection
of extracts from the notes of Isidore the
bishop, saying, 'I will not suffer my pupils
to read falsehoods, and labor without profit
in that book, after my death.' But on the
Tuesday before the Ascension his difficulty
of breathing began to distress him exceedingly,
and a slight tumor appeared in his
feet. He spent the whole day and dictated
to us with cheerfulness, saying occasionally,
'Lose no time; I know not how long I may
last. Perhaps in a very short time my
Maker may take me.' In fact, it seemed to
us that he knew the time of his death. He
lay awake the whole night praising God,
and at dawn on the Wednesday morning
ordered us to write quickly, which we did
till the hour of tierce. At that hour we
walked in procession with the relics, as the
rubric for the day prescribed; but one of us
remained to wait on him, and said to him,
'Dearest master, there still remains one
chapter unwritten; will it fatigue you if I ask
more questions?' 'No,' said Bede; 'take
your pen and mend it, and write quickly.'
This he did.</p>

<p>"At noon he said to me, 'I have some
valuables in my little chest&mdash;pepper, handkerchiefs,
and incense. Run quickly and
bring the priests of the monastery to me,
that I may make to them such presents as
God hath given to me. The rich of this
world give gold and silver and other things
of value; I will give to my brethren what
God hath given to me, and will give it with
love and pleasure.' I shuddered, but did
as he had bidden. He spoke to each one
in his turn, reminding and entreating them
to celebrate masses, and to pray diligently
for him, which all readily promised to do.</p>

<p>"When they heard him say that they
would see him no more in this world, all
burst into tears; but their tears were tempered
with joy when he said, 'It is time that
I return to Him who made me out of nothing
I have lived long, and kindly hath my merciful
Judge forecast the course of my life for
me. The time of my dissolution is at hand.
I wish to be released and to be with Christ.'
In this way he continued to speak cheerfully
till sunset, when the fore-mentioned youth
said, 'Beloved master, there is still one sentence
unwritten.' 'Then write quickly,'
said Bede. In a few minutes the youth
said, 'It is finished.' 'Thou hast spoken
truly,' replied Bede; 'take my head between
thy hands, for it is my delight to sit opposite
to that holy place in which I used to pray;
let me sit and invoke my Father.' Sitting
thus on the pavement of the cell, and repeating,
'Glory be to the Father, and to the
Son, and to the Holy Ghost,' as he finished
the word 'Ghost,' he breathed his last and
took his departure for heaven."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We read that St. Dunstan had
Mass celebrated in his room on the
day of his death; and after communicating,
he broke forth into the following
prayer, "Glory be to thee,
Almighty Father, who hast given the
bread of life from heaven to those
that fear thee, that we may be mindful
of thy wonderful mercy to man
in the incarnation of thine only-begotten
Son, born of the Virgin. To
thee, Holy Father, for that when we
were not, thou didst give to us a being,
and when we were sinners, didst
grant to us a Redeemer, we give due
thanks through the same thy Son,
our Lord and God, who with thee
and the Holy Ghost maketh all
things, governeth all things, and liveth
through ages and ages without end."
Shortly afterward he died in the sixty-fourth
year of his age.</p>

<p>The Cistercian abbot Aelred of
Yorkshire died in wonderful peace
after eight years of monastic life, repeating
with his last breath, "I will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
sing eternally, O Lord, thy mercy,
thy mercy, thy mercy!"</p>

<p>While St. Wilfrid of York lay dying
in the fair town of Oundle, the monks
did not cease chanting night and day
around his bed, though with much
ado, so bitterly they wept. When
they came to the one hundred and
third psalm, and were sweetly and solemnly
singing the words, "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Emittes spiritum
tuum, et creabuntur, et renovabis
faciem terræ</span>," "Thou shalt send
forth thy spirit, and they shall be
created; and thou shalt renew the
face of the earth," the words stirred
the soul of the careworn abbot, by
whose pillow lay the Lord's body and
blood; he turned his head gently,
and without a sigh gave back his soul
to God.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>St. Gilbert, when he was more than
a century old, used to exclaim, "How
long, O Lord, wilt thou forget me for
ever? Woe is me, for the time of my
sojourning is prolonged!" His soul
was at last released one morning at
the hour of dawn, while the monks
were repeating the verse of the office,
"The night is far spent, the day is at
hand."</p>

<p>Twenty abbots assembled to witness
the death of St. Stephen Harding
at Citeaux. Hearing them whisper
that he had nothing to fear after
so holy and austere a life, he said to
them trembling, "I assure you I go
to God in fear and trembling. If my
baseness should be found to have
ever done any good, even in this I
fear lest I should not have preserved
that grace with the humility and care
I ought."</p>

<p>St. Francis of Assisi, when he found
he was dying, wished to be laid on
the bare ground. When this was
done, he crossed his arms and said,
"Farewell, my children. I leave
you in the fear of God. Abide therein.
The time of trial and tribulation
cometh. Happy are they who persevere
in well-doing. For me, I go
to God joyfully, recommending you
all to his grace." He had the passion
according to the Gospel of St.
John read to him, and then repeated
in a feeble voice the one hundred
and forty-first psalm. Having said
the final verse, "Bring my soul out
of prison," he breathed his last.</p>

<p>St. Thomas Aquinas died lying on
ashes sprinkled on the floor. When
he saw the holy viaticum in the
priest's hands, he said, "I firmly believe
that Jesus Christ, true God and
true man, is present in this august
sacrament. I adore thee, my God
and my Redeemer. I receive thee,
the price of my redemption, the viaticum
of my pilgrimage, for whose
honor I have studied, labored, preached,
and taught. I hope I have never
advanced any tenet as thy word
which I had not learned from thee.
If through ignorance I have done
otherwise, I revoke it all and submit
my writings to the judgment of the
holy Roman Church." Thus lying in
peace and joy, he received the last
sacraments, and was heard to murmur,
"Soon, soon will the God of all
consolation crown his mercy to me
and satisfy all my desires. I shall
shortly be satiated in him, and drink
of the torrent of my delights; be inebriated
from the abundance of his
house; and in him, the source of life,
I shall behold the true light."</p>

<p>When the viaticum was brought to
St. Theresa, she rose up in her bed
and exclaimed, "My Lord and my
Spouse! the desired hour has at
length come. It is time for me to
depart hence." Her confessor asked
her if she wished to be buried in her
own convent at Avila. She replied,
"Have I any thing of my own in this
world? Will they not give me a little
earth here?" She died with the
crucifix in her hands, repeating, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
long as she could speak, the verse of
the Miserere, "A contrite and humble
heart, O God, thou wilt not despise!"</p>

<p>There is a touching account of a
renowned and pious knight who, in
the ages of faith, made a pilgrimage
to the Holy Land. Following lovingly
the traces of our Saviour's steps,
his heart became so broken with sorrow
and love that his life flowed out
through the wound. He visited with
tender devotion Nazareth, whose hills
leaped for joy when the Divine Word
became incarnate in the womb of a
Virgin; Mount Tabor, whose summit
was lit up by God glorifying his only
Son; the river Jordan, consecrated by
the baptism our Lord received at the
hands of St. John the Baptist; Bethlehem,
where in a poor manger were
heard the first cries of the Infant
Word; the Garden of Gethsemane,
which Jesus bedewed with a bloody
sweat; Golgotha, where by his blood
the Redeemer reconciled earth with
heaven; and the glorious tomb
whence the God-man issued triumphant
over death. Finally, he came to
the Mount of Olives. Here contemplating
the sacred foot-prints left on
the rock by the ascending Saviour,
he pressed his lips upon them with
loving gratitude; then gathering together
all the strength of his love,
raising his eyes and hands toward
heaven, and longing to ascend by the
way taken by our Saviour, "O Lord
Jesus!" he cried in all the ardor of
his love, "I can no longer find thee
or follow thee in this land of exile;
grant that my heart may ascend to
thee on high!" And, as he uttered
these ardent words, his soul fled to
God like an arrow direct to its aim.</p>

<p>I find in an old book the following
affecting account of the death of Friar
Benedict, who died at La Trappe on
the twentieth of August, 1674:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Brother Benedict, of the diocese of
Rouen, died five years and a half after his
profession, the day of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</i> of our father
St. Bernard, aged thirty-two years. And as
God visited him peculiarly with his grace in
the progress of his disease, and at the time
of his death, it has been thought desirable,
in order both to recognize the mercy of
Christ and for the edification of his community,
to record the principal circumstances
of his life and death.</p>

<p>"He fell sick nearly four years before his
death of a disease upon his chest, and although,
after that time, he was almost continually
oppressed with a violent cough, with
extreme pain, and with an intermitting fever,
he never manifested even the slightest impatience
of his suffering or the least desire
to be cured. About Christmas of the year
1673, which preceded his death a few months,
his disease increased. But he did not cease
to discharge the peculiar offices prescribed
to penitents in the monastery. The fever
which seized him about the middle of Christmas
did not prevent his following the same
course of life he had long pursued. Five
days after Easter, his disease having considerably
advanced, the reverend father abbot
ordered him to be conducted to the infirmary.
There his fever immediately increased,
his limbs inflamed, his cough became
more violent, and the struggles in which he
passed his nights quite exhausted him. Notwithstanding
this, he continued to lie on a
hard bed of straw till the moment when they
removed him to the ashes, five hours before
his death. He rose at four in the morning;
he dined at the table of the infirmary, though
his weakness was such that he was evidently
unable to sustain the weight of his own
head. During this time nothing was to be
discovered upon his countenance which did
not evidence the most complete tranquillity.
He had been remarkably ingenious, and had
nothing about him which he had not both
invented and executed. Three weeks before
his death, he said to the father abbot that,
as he had been in the habit of constructing
many things for the convenience of the monastery,
and as it might be troublesome to
the abbot to find and introduce workmen
into the house after his death, he would on
this account, if agreeable to the abbot, instruct
one of the brothers in his various arts.
The abbot having consented, he instructed
a monk in less than a fortnight in the different
arts in which he had been accustomed
to be employed. And notwithstanding his
weakness and pain, he did all this with so
much patience and collectedness that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
seemed to have lost all remembrance of his
sufferings. The father abbot, knowing the
grace which God had given to him, and the
degree in which God had detached him from
the world, thought it his duty to follow up
what he believed to be the designs of Providence
in regard to him. This led him in
the various ordinances of religion to maintain
all the rigor which charity and prudence
would permit; though in all private communications
with him he treated him with
the tenderness of a father. One day, when
so overcome with pain that he could take
nothing, he described his state to the father
abbot, accompanying his description with
certain expressions of countenance which it
is almost impossible to restrain in such circumstances.
The father abbot, however,
said with severity, (as though he had no
compassion for those sufferings in which he
sympathized so truly,) that 'he spoke like a
man of the world, and that a monk ought to
manifest under the worst circumstances the
constancy of his soul.' Benedict in an instant
assumed that air of severity that never
afterward quitted him. The fear lest the
great exertions which he made by day and
by night, combined with his extreme debility,
might suddenly remove him, led them
to give him the holy sacrament and extreme
unction. He received both with every demonstration
of piety. Such, however, was
his weakness that he immediately fainted
away. The father abbot having asked, before
they brought him the extreme unction,
if he desired that the whole community
should be present at the ceremony, he
answered that, 'exterior ceremonies were
not of vital importance; that his brethren
would derive little edification from him; and
that he had more need of their prayers than
their presence.' All his conversation during
his malady was on the necessity of separation
from worldly things, of the joy which
he anticipated in death, and of the mercy
which God had shown him in suffering him
to end his days in the society of the father
abbot.</p>

<p>"Some days before his death, the father
abbot inquired minutely into the state of his
mind; he answered in these very words, 'I
consider the day of my death as a festival;
I have no desire for any thing here, and I
cannot better express my total separation
from things below than by comparing myself
to a leaf which the wind has lifted from the
earth. All that I have read in the sacred
Scriptures comes home to me and fills me
with joy. Nevertheless, I can in no action
of my life see any thing which can sustain
the judgment of God, and which is not
worthy of punishment; but the confidence
which I have in his goodness gives me hope
and consolation.' He added, 'How can it
be that God should show such compassion
to a man who has so miserably served him?
I desire death alone; what can a man be
thinking of, not always to desire it? What
joy, my father, when I remember that I am
about to refresh myself in the waters of life.'</p>

<p>"His ordinary reading, for many years of
his life, had been the sacred Scriptures,
which were so familiar to him that he spoke
of little else. He mentioned to the father
abbot so many passages, and repeated them
in a manner so touching, so animated, and
so devotional, that his hearers were at once
edified and astonished. Those passages
which were uppermost in his mind respected
chiefly the majesty of God; but as he had a
most humble opinion of his own life, which
had however been, in the main, faithful and
pure, he always reverted to the subject of
the divine compassion. It was in that he
found peace and repose.</p>

<p>"On the day of the Assumption, he felt
himself so weak that he was unable to leave
the infirmary. The father abbot carried
him our Lord, whom he received upon his
knees, leaning on two of his brethren. Two
days afterward, he fell into strong convulsions,
and imagined that the hour of his
deliverance was come. The father abbot
asked, 'Is it with joy that you depart?'
'Yes,' said he, 'from my very heart.' He
then added, 'Into thy hands I commend my
spirit.'</p>

<p>"The customary prayers were then offered
up for the dying; but the convulsions having
left him, the father abbot said that the
hour of God was not arrived; and having
given orders to remove him from the ashes to
his bed, he turned to the father abbot with a
serene countenance, and said, 'The will of
God be done.' He lived three days waiting
with anxiety the time when God would have
mercy upon him. And such was his desire
of death that the father abbot was obliged
more than once to say to him that it was not
for him to anticipate the designs of Providence.
His pangs lasted till within an hour
of his death, but he endured them with his
accustomed patience and serenity. He said
three days before his death that the most
dangerous moments were the last, and that
he did not doubt the great enemy of man
would seek to disquiet him, and therefore
requested the prayers of the community.
The father abbot, having asked, after some
other general discourse, if he knew the guilt
of sin, he answered sighing, and, as it were,
looking into the recesses of his own soul,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
and in language expressive of the intensity
of his feelings, 'Alas! once I knew it not;
but now I see in the Scripture that God
claims, as one of his chief attributes, the
power of pardoning sin; "I am he who blotteth
out your iniquities." I am therefore
convinced that sin is a tremendous offence.
I am far, indeed, from being like those who
are always overwhelmed with a consciousness
of their offences, but yet I believe, upon
the testimony of faith and Scripture, that sin
is a fathomless gulf of ruin.' These words
were accompanied with a manner so extraordinary
that they touched the very hearts of
those who surrounded him.</p>

<p>"His bones having pierced his skin, and
his shirt of serge sticking to his wounds, he
begged them to move him a little; but at
the end of the day, when the person who had
the care of him wished again to ease his
body, he said, 'My brother, you give me too
much ease.' The father abbot having ordered
some milk to be brought him, which was
the only nourishment he took, he said, 'You
wish then, my father, to prolong my life, and
are unwilling I should die on the day of St.
Bernard.' The father abbot having quitted
him, he begged, perceiving that his death
approached, that he might be called back.
As soon as he saw him, he said, 'Father, my
eyes fail me&mdash;it is finished.' The father
having asked him in what state he found
himself, and if he was about to approach
Christ, 'Yes, father,' said he, 'by the grace
of God, I am. I am not indeed sensible of
any extraordinary elevation of my mind to
God; but through his mercy I am in perfect
peace. God be thanked!' This he repeated
three times. The father abbot having
asked him if he wished to die upon the cross
and upon the ashes, 'Yes,' said he, 'from
my heart.' With these words he lost his
speech, or, at all events, it was impossible
to hear any thing intelligible from him except
the name of Jesus, which he pronounced
repeatedly. They carried him to the
straw spread out in his chamber. He was
nearly four hours in a dying state, and preserved
his recollection during the whole
time. His eyes indicating a wandering state
of mind, the father arose, took some holy
water, and, having scattered it around him,
repeated these words, 'Let God arise and
let his enemies be scattered.' His face at
this moment resumed its serenity. He
kissed the cross several times, and, wanting
strength to lay hold of it, they observed that
he advanced his head to reverence it every
time that it was presented to him. At
length all his disquietudes ceased; they beheld
him calm, peaceful, serene; and he
breathed his last sigh with so much tranquillity
that those who watched him scarcely
perceived his death."</p></blockquote>

<p>When William the Conqueror was
on his death-bed, he confessed all the
sins of his life, from his youth up,
aloud and before a large number of
priests and nobles from England and
Normandy. We read that, after a
long agony, on Thursday, the ninth
of September, as the sun rose in glorious
splendor, William awoke, and
presently heard the great bell of the
metropolitan church. He asked why
it was ringing. "Seigneur," replied
his servants, "it is ringing for prime
at the church of our Lady St. Mary."
Then the king raised his eyes to heaven
and, lifting up his hands, said,
"I recommend myself to holy Mary,
Mother of God, that by her holy
prayers she may reconcile me to her
dear and beloved Son, our Lord Jesus
Christ." With these words he expired.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Peter, King of Aragon, at the approach
of death, devoutly confessed
all his sins and received the sacraments.
After bidding his family farewell,
he took a cross in his hands, lifted
his streaming eyes to heaven,
crossed himself three times, kissed
the cross, and then said, "O Lord
our Father, Jesus Christ our true
God! into thy hands I commend my
spirit. Deign by thy holy passion to
receive my soul into paradise with
the blessed St. Martin, whose festival
Christians this day celebrate." And
with his eyes still raised heavenward,
he departed.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>When James, an unlearned lay
brother of the order of St. Francis,
came to die, he begged pardon of all
his brethren, took a wooden cross
from the head of his bed, kissed it,
put it to his eyes, and then said, with
tenderness, "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dulce lignum, dulces
clavos, dulcia ferens pondera, quæ
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
sola fuisti digna sustinere Regem
c&oelig;lorum et Dominum</span>," "O sweet
wood, sweet nails, supporting a sweet
burden! Thou alone wast worthy to
sustain the King and Lord of the
heavens." All around him were
greatly astonished, for he was unlearned,
and they had never heard
him speak in Latin.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>We read in the life of St. Gertrude
of the death of a young person, who
from her infancy upward had always
shown a real spirit of detachment
from the world. When she found
herself in the agony of death, she
bade farewell to all who were present,
promising to be mindful of them before
God. Then turning in her sufferings
toward the Heavenly Bridegroom,
she earnestly said, "O Lord,
who knowest the most secret thoughts
of my heart, thou hast known how
eagerly I have longed to spend all
the powers of my being, even unto
old age, in thy service; now that I
feel thou desirest to recall me to thyself,
all my desire of serving thee in
this world is changed to such an ardent
longing to behold thee, and be
united to thee, that death, however
bitter it may be to others, only seems
sweet to me." She wished the sisters
to read to her the account of the
sufferings of our Saviour in the Gospel
of St. John, and when they came
to the words, "He bowed his head
and gave up the ghost," she asked
for a crucifix. She lovingly kissed
the feet of the image of our Saviour,
thanked him for his graces, commended
her soul to his care, and
then slept peacefully in our Lord.</p>

<p>Our own Mother Seton, though
she saw the intense grief of all the
community, and heard the sobs of
her daughter, who fainted at her
side, died with the most profound
composure. Her whole appearance
indicated peace and resignation.
Lifting her hands and eyes to heaven,
she said, "May the most just, the
most high, and the most amiable will
of God be accomplished for ever."
Her last words were the sacred
names of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.</p>

<p>The poet Tasso, when informed
that his last hour was at hand, not
only received the warning without
alarm, but, embracing the physician,
thanked him for tidings so agreeable,
and, raising his eyes to heaven, returned
tender and devout thanks to his
Creator that, after so tempestuous a
life, he now brought him to a calm
haven. From this time he did not
speak willingly on terrestrial subjects,
not even of that fame after death of
which through life he had been most
solicitous; but resigned himself
wholly and with the liveliest devotion
to the last solemn offices prescribed
by his religion. After confessing
with great contrition, and receiving
twice the sacrament with a reverence
and humility that affected all the beholders,
he received the papal benediction
humbly and gratefully, saying
this was the chariot upon which he
hoped to go crowned, not with
laurel as a poet into the capital, but
with glory as a saint to heaven.
When he had arranged all his earthly
affairs, he begged to be left alone
with his crucifix and one or two spiritual
advisers, who by turns sung
psalms, in which he sometimes joined.
When his voice failed, his eyes still
remained fixed upon the image of the
crucified Redeemer. His last act was
to embrace it closely. His last words,
"Into thy hands, O Lord."</p>

<p>I quote the following account of
the death of the great Raphael, in the
form of a letter from Cardinal Bibbiena:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As I entered, he held in his hand a few
spring flowers, which he let fall as I handed
him the rosary. He pressed the cross to
his lips and whispered, 'Maria.' His voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
had a peculiar sound, clear but so low as
to be scarcely audible. In the sick-room I
found Count Castiglione, the good fathers
Antonio and Domenico, the painter Giulio,
and others. They had moved his couch to
the window which stood wide open. Was
it the effect of the softening light or of the
approaching triumph? Raphael had never
appeared more beautiful. His complexion
was more roseate, and his thoughtful,
brown artist-eyes larger and more luminous
than usual. I told him what his holiness
had requested me to say.</p>

<p>"'And so, dear Raphael,' I concluded,
'may the sympathy which the highest as
well as the lowest feels for you, have the
power to keep you long with us!'</p>

<p>"He smiled sadly.</p>

<p>"'You will, you must!' broke in Castiglione.
'Think what a longing for art
your attainments have awakened within us.
Think of your favorite plan to rebuild classical
Rome, with its marble palaces and
temples, its triumphal arches and picture
galleries!'</p>

<p>"'Yes, I desired it,' replied he; 'and if
God had granted me longer life, I should
have succeeded.'</p>

<p>"'Do you still speak,' said I reproachfully,
'as if you would never recover?'</p>

<p>"'O father!' said he, 'the separation is
not easy for me. If I could describe to
you the longing which I have to retain the
departing day! How my heart cherished
the last ray of the sun that lingered on the
hill! How beautiful is the world, how
beautiful the faces of men! And now to
take leave of them for ever&mdash;to sleep without
hope of seeing the morrow!'</p>

<p>"'Beloved,' said I, 'do not forget that
to-day the Saviour died, that we might
throw off this mortal life and put on immortality.'</p>

<p>"'How should I forget Him from whom
I have received every thing?' he answered
softly. 'But even this mortal life was
beautiful.'</p>

<p>"There was a moment's silence. Castiglione
had taken Raphael's hand. The
latter was looking through the open window
at the distant hills that were lit up
with the soft glow of the setting sun.
Then his glance wandered, evidently in the
direction of his thoughts, to the blue heavens,
where the evening star looked down
quietly like a messenger from the other
world.</p>

<p>"'I shall see Dante,' said he suddenly.</p>

<p>"At this moment one of those present
took the cover from Raphael's last picture,
which hung on the wall opposite the couch.
It is, as you know, an altar-piece&mdash;the
<i>Transfiguration</i>. The sight of the immortal
work, the dying master, the subject of
the picture, and all remembrances associated
therewith, overpowered us, and we wept
aloud.</p>

<p>"His features began to change quickly,
he spoke still, but wearily and without connection,
though in significant phrases.
Twice we heard those words of Plato,
'Great is the hope, and beautiful the
prize!' He mentioned your name, too,
and begged that you would lay your hand
on his head.... The painter Giulio
threw himself on the couch and wept in
agony. I asked the others to kneel with
me and pray for the dying.</p>

<p>"Once more Raphael revived, and, supported
by two friends, arose and looked
around with wide-open eyes.</p>

<p>"'Whence comes the sunshine?' murmured
he.</p>

<p>"'Raphael!' cried I, and extended both
hands toward him, 'do you recognize me?'
For a moment it seemed as if he had not
heard me, then he spoke again, and the holy
calm of his expression, in spite of the
death-struggle, bore testimony to his words,
'Happy.'... He did not speak
again; but it was full night when a voice
broke through the long stillness, 'Raphael
is dead!'"</p></blockquote>

<p>He died on Good-Friday, 1520,
aged thirty-seven.</p>

<p>Besides these holy and edifying
deaths, which might be continued indefinitely,
we all have treasured up
in our heart of hearts the sacred
memory of some dear ones whose last
words will go on vibrating in our
hearts for ever.</p>

<h2>REPLY OF THE PRESBYTERIAN ASSEMBLIES TO THE
POPE'S LETTER.</h2>


<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">To Pius IX., Bishop of Rome</span>:</p>

<p>"In your encyclical letter, dated Sept.
13th, 1868, you invite 'all Protestants' to
'embrace the opportunity' presented by the
council summoned to meet in the city of
Rome during the month of December of the
current year, to 'return to the only one
fold,' intending thereby, as the connection
implies, the Roman Catholic Church. That
letter has been brought to the notice of the
two General Assemblies of the Presbyterian
Church in the United States of America.
Those assemblies represent nearly five thousand
ministers of the gospel, and a still
larger number of Christian congregations.</p>

<p>"Believing, as we do, that it is the will of
Christ that his church on earth should be
one; and recognizing the duty of doing all
we consistently can to promote Christian
charity and fellowship, we deem it right to
say in few words why we cannot comply
with your invitation, or participate in the deliberations
of the approaching council.</p>

<p>"It is not because we reject any article of
the Catholic faith. We are not heretics;
we receive all the doctrines contained in the
ancient symbol known as the Apostles'
Creed; we regard as consistent with Scripture
the doctrinal decisions of the first six
&oelig;cumenical councils; and because of that
consistency we receive those decisions as expressing
our own faith. We believe the
doctrines of the Trinity and Person of Christ
as those doctrines are set forth by the Council
of Nice, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 325; by that of Chalcedon,
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 451; and by that of Constantinople, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
680.</p>

<p>"With the whole Catholic Church, therefore,
we believe that there are three persons
in the Godhead, the Father, the Son, and
the Holy Ghost; and that these three are
one God, the same in substance, and equal
in power and glory.</p>

<p>"We believe that the Eternal Son of God
became man by taking to himself a true
body and a reasonable soul; and so was, and
continues to be, both God and man, in two
distinct natures and one person for ever.
We believe that our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ is the Prophet of God, whose teachings
we are bound to receive, and in whose
promises we confide. He is the high-priest
of our profession, whose infinitely meritorious
satisfaction to divine justice, and whose
ever-prevalent intercession is the only
ground of our justification and acceptance
before God. He is our King, to whom our
allegiance is due, not only as his creatures,
but as the purchase of his blood. To his
authority we submit; in his care we trust;
and to his service we and all creatures in
heaven and earth should be devoted.</p>

<p>"We believe, moreover, all those doctrines
concerning sin, grace, and predestination,
known in history as Augustinian.
Those doctrines were sanctioned by the
Council of Carthage, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 416; by a more
general council in the same place, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 418;
by Zosimus, Bishop of Rome, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 418; and
by the third &OElig;cumenical Council at Ephesus,
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 481. It is impossible, therefore,
that we should be pronounced heretical without
including the whole ancient church in
the same condemnation. We not only
'glory in the name of Christians, but profess
the true faith of Christ, and follow the communion
of the Catholic Church.' Still further
to quote your own words, 'Truth must
continue ever stable and not subject to any
change.'</p>

<p>"Neither are we schismatics. We believe
in true 'Catholic unity.' We cordially
recognize as members of Christ's visible
church on earth all who profess the true
religion, together with their children. We
are not only willing, but earnestly desire, to
maintain Christian communion with them,
provided they do not prescribe as a condition
of such communion that we should profess
what the word of God condemns, or do
what that word forbids. If any church prescribes
unscriptural conditions of fellowship,
the error and the fault are with such church,
and not with us.</p>

<p>"But, although neither heretics nor schismatics,
we cannot accept your invitation, because
we still hold the principles which
prompted our 'ancestors,' in the name of
primitive Christianity, and in defence of the
'true faith,' bravely to protest against the
errors and abuses which had been foisted
upon the church&mdash;principles for which our
fathers were, by the Council of Trent, representing
the church over which you preside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
excommunicated and pronounced accursed.
The most important of those principles
are the following:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">First.</span> That the word of God, as contained
in the Scriptures of the Old and New
Testament, is the only infallible rule of faith
and practice. The Council of Trent, however,
demands that we receive, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pari pietatis
affectu</i>, the teachings of tradition as supplementing
and interpreting the written word
of God. This we cannot do without incurring
the condemnation which our Lord pronounced
on the Pharisees when he said,
'Ye make void the word of God by your
traditions.'</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Second.</span> The right of private judgment.
When we open the Scriptures, we find them
addressed to the people. They speak to us;
they command us to search their sacred pages;
they require us to believe what they
teach, and to do what they enjoin; they hold
us personally responsible for our faith and
conduct. The promise of the inward teaching
of the Spirit to guide men into the
knowledge of the truth, is made to the people
of God; not to the clergy exclusively;
much less to any special order of the clergy
alone. The Apostle John says to believers,
'Ye have an unction from the Holy One, and
know all things; and the anointing which
ye have received of him abideth with you,
and ye have not need that any man teach
you.' (1 John ii. 20 and 27.) The Apostle
Paul commands us (the people) to pronounce
accursed an apostle, or an angel
from heaven, who teaches any thing contrary
to the divinely authenticated word of God.
(Gal. i. 8.) He makes the people the judges
of truth and error as accountable to God
only; he places the rule of judgment in
their hands, and holds them responsible for
their decisions. Private judgment, therefore,
is not only a right, but a duty, from which no
man can exonerate himself or be exonerated
by others.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Third.</span> We believe in the universal
priesthood of believers; that is, that all
men have, through Christ, access by one
Spirit unto the Father. (Eph. ii. 18.) They
need no human priest to secure their access
to God. Every man for himself may come
with boldness to the throne of grace to obtain
mercy and find grace to help in time of
need. (Heb. iv. 16.) 'Having, therefore,
boldness to enter into the holiest by the
blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, ...
and having a High-Priest over the house of
God, we may all draw near with a true heart
in full assurance of faith, having our hearts
sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our
bodies washed with pure water.' (Heb. x.
19-22.) To admit, therefore, the priesthood
of the clergy, whose intervention is necessary
to secure for the people the remission
of sins and other benefits of redeeming grace,
we regard as involving either the rejection
of the priesthood of Christ, or a denial of
its sufficiency.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Fourth.</span> We deny the perpetuity of
the apostleship. As no man can be a prophet
without the spirit of prophecy, so no
man can be an apostle without the gifts of
an apostle. Those gifts, as we learn from
Scripture, are plenary knowledge of the gospel,
derived by immediate revelation from
Christ, (Gal. i. 12,) and personal infallibility
in teaching and ruling. What are the seals
of the apostleship, we learn from what St.
Paul says to the Corinthians, 'Truly the
signs of an apostle were wrought among you
in all patience, in signs, in wonders, in mighty
deeds.' (2 Cor. xii. 12.) Modern prelates,
although they claim apostolic authority, do
not pretend to possess the gifts on which
that authority was founded; nor do they
venture to exhibit the 'signs' by which the
commission of the messengers of Christ was
authenticated. We cannot, therefore, recognize
them, either individually or collectively,
as the infallible teachers and rulers of the
church.</p>

<p>"Much less can we acknowledge the
Bishop of Rome to be Christ's vicar upon
earth, possessing 'supreme rule.' We acknowledge
our adorable Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ to be the only head of the
church, which is his body. We believe
that although now enthroned at the right
hand of the Majesty on high, he is still present
with his people on earth, whom he
governs by his word, providence, and spirit.
We cannot, therefore, put any creature in
his place, or render to a man the obedience
which is due to Christ alone.</p>

<p>"As the Church of Rome excommunicates
all those who profess the principles
above enumerated; as we regard these principles
to be of vital importance, and intend
to assert them more earnestly than ever;
as God appears to have given his seal and
sanction to these principles by making the
countries where they are held the leaders in
civilization&mdash;the most eminent for liberty,
order, intelligence, and all forms of private
and social prosperity&mdash;it is evident that the
barrier between us and you is, at present,
insurmountable.</p>

<p>"Although this letter is not intended to
be either objurgatory or controversial, it is
known to all the world that there are doctrines
and usages of the church over which
you preside which Protestants believe to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
not only unscriptural, but contrary to the
faith and practice of the early church. Some
of those doctrines and usages are the following,
namely, The doctrine of transubstantiation
and the sacrifice of the mass; the
adoration of the host; the power of judicial
absolution, (which places the salvation of the
people in the hands of the priests;) the doctrine
of the grace of orders, that is, that supernatural
power and influence are conferred
in ordination by the imposition of hands;
the doctrine of purgatory; the worship of
the Virgin Mary; the invocation of saints;
the worship of images; the doctrine of reserve
and of implicit faith, and the consequent
withholding the Scriptures from the
people, etc.</p>

<p>"So long as the profession of such doctrines
and submission to such usages are
required, it is obvious that there is an impassable
gulf between us and the church by
which such demands are made.</p>

<p>"While loyalty to Christ, obedience to
the holy Scriptures, consistent respect for
the early councils of the church, and the
firm belief that pure 'religion is the foundation
of all human society,' compel us to
withdraw from fellowship with the Church
of Rome, we, nevertheless, desire to live
in charity with all men. We love all who
love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity.
We cordially recognize as Christian brethren
all who worship, trust, and serve him
as their God and Saviour according to the
inspired word. And we hope to be united
in heaven with all those who unite with us on
earth in saying, 'Unto him who loved us,
and washed us from our sins in his own
blood, and hath made us kings and priests
unto God&mdash;to him be glory and dominion
for ever and ever. Amen.' (Rev. i. 6.)</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>We will preface our remarks upon
the foregoing document by a few words
of explanation to our European readers
respecting the bodies whose joint
manifesto it is.</p>

<p>The Presbyterians of the United
States are quite distinct from the Congregationalists
of New England, the
descendants of the English Puritans,
although the two fraternize together
to a great extent. The Presbyterian
Church is the daughter of the Kirk
of Scotland, having its home in the
Middle States, whence it has spread
through the country, especially toward
the West. Its government is more
vigorous than that of any other church
except the Methodist, and its doctrinal
strictness surpasses that of all
other large societies. Its clergy number
about five thousand, having, we
believe, somewhere near a half a million
of communicants, and three or
four times as many members in a
looser sense. It is, on the whole, the
first denomination as regards respectability,
taking the country generally,
and in all its periods of history; and,
if we reckon its allies, the Dutch
Reformed and Congregationalist societies,
with it, as representing the
Calvinistic phase of Protestantism,
this is the system which has possessed
the same vantage-ground in the British
colonies of the United States
that the Episcopal Church has taken
in England.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
Some thirty years ago,
the Presbyterian body split into two
great divisions by means of a dispute
about rigid and moderate Calvinism,
and rigid or lax enforcement of the
Presbyterian polity. The two General
Assemblies which recently met in
this city adopted a plan of reunion
which will probably receive general
acceptance, and fuse the Old and
New School Presbyterians together
again in one body. The letter to the
pope proceeds from the two assemblies,
acting through their respective
moderators in virtue of a resolution
which passed both houses, which explains
the fact that it is signed by two
distinct presiding officers. With these
few prefatory remarks, we pass to the
consideration of the document itself.</p>

<p>We are very glad that the Presbyterian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Assemblies have replied to the
pontifical letter. We are sure that
all calmly-reflecting persons will agree
that in doing so they have fulfilled an
obligation of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bienséance</i> required by
a sense both of the dignity of the
Roman see and of their own respectability.
They have shown, therefore,
more courtesy and more self-respect
than either the Eastern patriarchs
or the Protestant Episcopal
bishops, and, so to speak, have taken
the water of their haughty rival, the
General Convention. The tone of
the document is remarkably dignified
and courteous, and it will undoubtedly
be so considered by the prelates of
the council and the Holy Father. We
would suggest to the gentlemen whose
signatures are appended the propriety
of making an authentic translation of
the document into the Latin language,
and of sending this, with the original,
in an official manner, properly certified,
to Rome. The editor of
the <cite>Evangelist</cite> seems to apprehend
that the addressing of this letter to
the pope might be deemed officious
or impertinent. We can assure him,
however, and all other persons concerned,
that this is by no means the
case. The address of the pope to all
Christians not in his communion was
no mere formality, but perfectly sincere
and in earnest. The Nestorian and
Eutychian, as well as the Greek
bishops, were invited to present themselves
at the council, although these
are far less orthodox on the fundamental
doctrines of the Trinity and
Incarnation than the Presbyterian
Assemblies have proved themselves to
be, by their full confession of agreement
with the faith of the Roman
Church on these articles. It is true
that the above-mentioned bishops
were invited on a different footing&mdash;not
merely as Christians, but as bishops.
The reason of this is, that their
episcopal character is recognized and
does not need to be proved. Therefore,
all they have to do is to purge
themselves of heresy and schism in
order to be entitled, <i>ipso facto</i>, to
take their places as constituent members
of the council, with the
right of voting, which will most
certainly not be otherwise conceded
to them. The Protestant bishops
could not be invited as bishops,
because their episcopal character is
not recognized. If some of them
should appear to put in their claim,
we have no doubt, from the tenor of
letters published in the English Catholic
papers, that they would be received
with great respect and consideration,
and be allowed to argue their
cause either before the council or a
special congregation. It is not yet
too late for some of them, who have
sufficient courage and confidence in
their cause, to do it, and we hope they
will. Presbyterian Protestants make
no claim to episcopal succession or
ordination. Consequently they, by
their own admission, must be regarded
by the council, and by all who
adhere to the hierarchical principle on
which the first six councils were constituted,
as destitute of any right to
a position above that of laymen.
Nevertheless, they are the heads and
teachers of large and respectable societies,
equal in point of fact, in our
judgment, to those who call themselves
bishops or presbyters in episcopally-governed
Protestant societies,
and therefore entitled to respect and
consideration. No doubt they would
receive all this were they to present
themselves at the council as representatives
of their religious societies.
Of course, a council cannot consent
to treat as open questions any matters
already defined by previous councils,
or enter into a controversial discussion
of doctrines with men who,
like Dr. Cumming, would wish to go
there as champions of Protestantism.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
The only attitude in which it would
be proper to appear at a council would
be that of persons asking for an explanation
of the Catholic doctrines,
and of the motives on which they are
based, which implies a disposition to
reconsider anew the grounds of the
original separation. That this disposition
does not exist at present very
extensively we are well aware, and
cannot, therefore, expect that there
will be at the approaching council
any thing like a conference of the
heads of Protestantism with the Catholic
prelates. There may be other
councils, however, at no very distant
period, where this may take place
with very great advantage, and with
the happiest results in reuniting
all Christians within the one fold of
Christ's church. It is something, however,
to get from a great religious society
like the Presbyterian body of the
United States a formal statement of
the reasons why they remain separated
from the Catholic Church, in the
shape of a letter to the pope. Such
a statement has very great interest
and great weight, and the document
before us is certainly far superior to
the encyclical of the Pan-Anglican
Synod, or the other manifestoes of a
similar kind which have been issued
from various Protestant assemblies.
The amiable editor of the <cite>Evangelist</cite>
compares it to "a hand of iron under
a velvet glove." We will venture,
however, until some stronger and
more authoritative hand shall be
stretched out to measure strength
with it, to submit our own, though a
small one, to its grasp, wearing a
glove of the same material. We do
this without fear and without ill-will,
though our remarks are only those of
a private individual, having no force
beyond the reason that is in them.
We do it the more readily, and with
greater interest, as the writer of this
article is the son of a former moderator
of one of these assemblies, and is
indebted to that respectable body for
some special prayers which it charitably
offered for his spiritual welfare.</p>

<p>The first and most striking feature
noticeable in the letter is the exculpation
from heresy and schism which
it puts forward. Nothing could
show more clearly that the compilers
feel that there is a <i>prima-facie</i> case
against them. They are in the attitude
of men who have broken off
from the body of Christendom, separated
from the communion which
once included all Christians, and put
forth a doctrine special to themselves,
thus "condemned by their own judgment,"<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
as St. Paul says is characteristic
of those who turn aside from
sound doctrine. We do not judge
any one individual among the Presbyterians
to be a formal heretic or
schismatic. The authors of the separation
lived centuries ago, and men
of this generation have been placed
in their state of separation by the act
of their ancestors. We speak, therefore,
only of material heresy and
schism, not in an offensive sense,
but from the necessity of being distinct
and adhering to the phraseology
which the document before us
itself uses. We are obliged to say,
therefore, that the very exculpation it
presents is a proof of the existence of
that state of heresy and schism which
is denied. The fact of having departed
from the doctrine and communion
in which the authors of Presbyterianism
were educated, and which
is that of the great body of Christians
descending in unbroken continuity
from the past, is acknowledged. The
excuse given is, that the church had
erred, added to the faith, changed
the law, and was therefore herself
responsible. The very justification
which is made establishes the truth
of the charge. It establishes the fact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
that particular members of the church
set up a private doctrine and a private
organization against the Catholic
doctrine and communion, which is
precisely what is meant by heresy
and schism.</p>

<p>It is thus that a person who refuses
to submit to the judgment of the
church judges himself. So long as
he professes to submit to the church,
and disputes not the binding authority
of her doctrines, but their proper
sense and meaning, his case is one for
adjudication, like that of Pelagius;
but as soon as he rejects the acknowledged
doctrine of the church, defined
by a competent tribunal, as erroneous,
he at once pronounces himself an
alien from the commonwealth, and by
his own sentence forfeits all the rights
of his citizenship in it. The Presbyterian
judicatories act on this principle.
The test of heresy with them
is denial of the doctrines defined in
their confession of faith. The individual,
or even the congregation, is not
the final authority. The presbytery,
the synod, the general assembly, are
all legislative and judicial courts, deciding
questions of doctrine and discipline
with authority, and exacting
submission from each individual clergyman
and layman as a condition
of church fellowship. They avow,
therefore, and act on the principle,
that the revolt of the individual
against church discipline is, <i>ipso facto</i>,
schism, and his revolt against church
doctrine, <i>ipso facto</i> heresy; so that by
his very declaration, that he is in the
right and the church in the wrong, he
judges himself as a schismatic or heretic.
Yet they themselves in judging
their own refractory members have
given a far more signal example of
that self-judgment which St. Paul
speaks of. For they have acted in
the same manner toward the church
universal as their own condemned
members have acted toward them,
and have thus sentenced themselves
in pronouncing upon these their ecclesiastical
censure.</p>

<p>This principle is capable of a more
amplified statement and application.
Heresy consists essentially in the denial
of a part of the Catholic faith,
coupled with the profession of the
remaining parts. It is an affirmation
and negation, in the same breath,
of the same principles. It is, therefore,
self-judged, because the affirmation
which it makes in general terms
of the truth of the Catholic faith, and
of a greater or lesser number of the
distinct dogmas of the faith, condemns
and contradicts the denial
which it makes of some one or more
particular doctrines of the same faith.
Moreover, every sect condemns all
the other errors condemned by the
church, except its own; so that, taking
all heresies in the aggregate, they
condemn and destroy each other; according
to the declaration of holy
Scripture, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mentita est iniquitas sibi</i>&mdash;unrighteousness
has proved false
to itself.</p>

<p>We find, therefore, that the spokesmen
of the Presbyterian assemblies
admit the obligation of Catholic
unity, profess their belief in the Catholic
church and the Catholic faith,
and yet do not venture to assert that
the Presbyterian family is the Catholic
Church, its doctrine the Catholic
faith; that it possesses unity in itself,
and that all those Christians who are
separated from it are bound to seek
admission into its fold. They take
what they implicitly admit to be an
exceptional, abnormal position; they
profess themselves to be only a fragmentary
portion of Christendom, and
excuse themselves for their isolation
on the plea that there is a chasm
separating them from the great mass
of Christians which they cannot pass.
When we examine the special points
made in this plea more closely, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
find that all the positive affirmations
of doctrine are affirmations of truths
held in common with the Catholic
Church, and that all the statements
peculiar to the authors of the document
are protests or negations. The
Trinity, Incarnation, Redemption,
etc., are palpably Catholic doctrines.
The Augustinian doctrines of sin,
grace, and predestination, so far as
they are the statements or definitions
of Catholic faith in opposition
to the heresy of Pelagius, are dogmas,
and so far as they are the opinions
of a school, are sound opinions,
though open to discussion. No Catholic
writer ever dreamed of censuring
them as heretical. The inspiration
and infallibility of the holy
Scriptures, the priesthood of all Christians,
the right and duty of private
judgment, the illumination and inward
guidance of individual believers
by the Holy Spirit, are all sound Catholic
doctrines, when properly explained
and harmonized with other
doctrines. These are the principal positive
statements of the document, and
they add nothing whatever in the
shape of new, living, constructive principle
of belief or organization to that
sum of truth which the Presbyterians
have received from the old tradition.
Although some of the negations of Catholic
doctrine are put in a positive
form, yet it is only the mode of expression
which is positive, while the
substance of the proposition is a negation.
For instance, the proposition
that Scripture is the sole authority,
so far as it enunciates a truth which is
positive, declares the inspiration and
infallibility of the Scripture; but so far
as it goes beyond that declaration, is
really a negation of the authority of
the unwritten word, expressed in the
form of an affirmation that the Scripture
is the <em>sole</em> authority. So, also,
the whole of what is peculiar to the
Presbyterian doctrine as distinguished
from the Catholic, in the affirmation
of the universal priesthood, the
rights of individual reason, the inward
light of the Holy Spirit, is derived
from a negation of the hierarchical
and sacerdotal orders, the
authority of the church, and her infallibility.
Then follows a long list
of Catholic doctrines which are denied,
and which the Roman Church is
accused of having added to the ancient
creed. We cannot be expected
to go into the details of these doctrines
singly, for the purpose of proving
that the church has defined and
proposed them on sufficient motives.</p>

<p>There are plenty of books in which
the reverend gentlemen of the Presbyterian
Church, and the intelligent
laymen who adhere to that communion,
can find the full and complete
statement, with the proofs, of
every portion of Catholic doctrine
and discipline. For certain portions
of it, they need not look beyond the
bounds of Protestantism. The divines
of the Church of England, and
the controversial writers of the High-Church
party in the United States,
have proved the hierarchical principle,
the episcopal succession, the grace of
the sacraments, the real presence,
and other doctrines akin to these,
with solid arguments from Scripture
and history which the advocates of
Presbyterianism have never been able
to refute. A section of the clergy
of another Presbyterian communion,
to wit, the German Reformed, have
been led by their study of Scripture
and the ancient authors to adopt and
advocate similar principles totally contrary
to those of the reverend moderators.
They certainly cannot put
forth their statements, therefore, as
certain and evident facts or truths,
admitted by all who have studied the
Scriptures and ancient authors, even
among Protestants. Their reiteration
of them consequently establishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
nothing, proves nothing; in no wise
can be alleged as a justification of
their position. It is a mere defining
of their position, which gives no new
information whatever to any person,
and therefore the discussion may
justly be relegated to the arena of
regular polemics.</p>

<p>So far as the reverend doctors have
made use of arguments, however, it
is proper that we should pay some
attention to these, and this they have
done in regard to a few points, although
with the brevity to which the
nature of their document restricted
them.</p>

<p>(1.) Their first argument is against
the authority of tradition. It is that,
by receiving the teachings of tradition
as of equal authority with the teachings
of Scripture, we incur the
condemnation pronounced by our
Lord against the Pharisees when he
said, "<i>Ye make void the word of God
by your traditions</i>." The answer to
this is obvious. The traditions of the
Pharisees were private, human, recent
traditions, not derived from the oral
teaching of Moses or other inspired
prophets, but from the unauthorized
glosses or interpretations of the text
of the law, made by the rabbis and
scribes exercising their own private
judgment. They were contrary to
the true sense of the law, subversive
of it, and maintained in opposition to
the authority of Jesus Christ, the divinely
commissioned interpreter and
judge of doctrine. What has this to
do with a tradition descending from
the oral teaching of Jesus Christ and
the apostles, agreeing with, explaining,
and supplementing the teaching
of the Scripture? The canon of the
New Testament is such a tradition,
and the Presbyterians have, consequently,
if their opinion is a true one,
incurred the condemnation of the
Lord by receiving it. That traditions
which are derived from the pure,
original source of revelation are to be
received, is proved by the commandment
of St. Paul to the Thessalonians
to "<i>Stand firm: and hold the traditions
which you have learned, whether
by word or our epistle</i>."<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
This is precisely
what Catholics do. We hold
all that has been delivered to us
by the apostles, whether transmitted
through the Scriptures or through
tradition. Presbyterians reject apostolic
and Catholic tradition, but make
void the word of God; that is, they
pervert or deny a great portion of the
doctrine revealed by Jesus Christ
through the apostles, by their own
human, unauthorized traditions.
Thus, they reject a number of the
books of the Old Testament declared
canonical by the same apostolic tradition
which fixes the canon of the
New Testament, by following the
tradition of the Jews. They follow,
in respect to divers other essential
points of doctrine as well as discipline,
the traditions of Luther and Calvin.
Practically, they are entirely under
the control of this human, modern
tradition, which is designated by the
reverend moderators as "the principles
which prompted our 'ancestors,'
in the name of primitive Christianity,
and in defence of the 'true faith,'
bravely to protest against the errors
and abuses which had been foisted
upon the church;" that is to say,
against Catholic and apostolic tradition.</p>

<p>(2.) Their second argument is in
favor of the right of private judgment&mdash;that
is, according to their way of
understanding this right&mdash;against the
authority of the teaching church as
the final, supreme judge of doctrine.
The argument in brief is, that the
Scriptures address the individual
mind and conscience of every reader
in an authoritative manner, commanding
him to search their pages, promising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
him the divine illumination
to understand their meaning, holding
him responsible to God for the belief
and practice of their teachings, and
forbidding him to listen to any teacher
who shall present to him any doctrine
differing from that which they
contain. Suppose we grant all this.
What then? Presbyterianism gains
nothing. It cannot defend itself
against other forms of Protestantism.
It cannot establish its system either
of doctrine or discipline. Moreover,
an able, profound, biblical scholar,
such as is Dr. Pusey, for example,
will be able to prove from the Scripture
the greater number of all those
Catholic doctrines against which
these divines protest as errors of the
Roman Church. Among these doctrines
thus contained in Scripture,
and ascertainable even by one who
begins his search properly qualified
and disposed, but without any other
authority except private judgment to
direct him, are the authority of tradition
and of the church. What now
is the individual to do? The Scripture,
as he supposed when he began
to search it, teaches the right and
duty of private judgment upon its
own contents, as the exclusive method
of learning the truths revealed from
heaven to men. He has followed
this method conscientiously, relying
on the promise of divine illumination
made to all sincere seekers after
truth, and he now finds himself referred
to another authority, that of
the church. What is he to do now?
Reject the Scriptures and the whole
system of positive Christianity as
inconsistent and self-contradictory?
The Presbyterian divines cannot
sanction this conclusion. Then he
must conclude that he had imperfectly
apprehended what the Scriptures
teach respecting the right and
duty of the individual to judge of
their true sense and meaning, and
must harmonize in some way their
teaching on this point with their
teaching on the other point, namely,
the authority of the church. This is
the way in which many have reached
the church by the road of private
judgment. They have opened and
searched the Scriptures, assuming at
the outset that they are the inspired
word of God, addressed to them as
individuals and intelligible to their
own private reason, assisted by grace,
without any extrinsic aid or interpreter.
The fact that they have been
able to reach the same knowledge of
their true sense which the Catholic
Church imparts to her children in a
shorter way, is no proof, however,
that this is the ordinary way in which
the Lord intended that men should
gain this knowledge. We deny totally
that it is. It is very easy to
assume the Scriptures in arguing with
Catholics who affirm their authority.
We deny, however, that the assumption
is justifiable on Protestant principles.
When the reverend doctors
quietly say, "We open the Scriptures,"
we meet them at once with a
denial of their logical right to assert
that there are any Scriptures to be
opened. If the word of God is manifested
to each individual directly
through a book, without human
media, that book must be a miraculous
work of God created by him immediately,
and authenticated by some
manifest sign from heaven. The
Bible is not such a book. It is not a
book at all, in the strict sense of the
word. It is a collection of writings
made by the church, authenticated as
divine by her authority, and therefore
always presupposing her existence
and the existence of that faith and
those laws by which she is constituted
the church. To say that the exhortations
of the sacred books of Scripture
are addressed to each individual
singly, without reference to the church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
of which he is a member or of the
doctrine which she teaches, is about
as sensible as to say that St. Paul's
direction to "salute Andronicus and
Junias" was directed to the moderators
of the two assemblies.</p>

<p>If all explicit teaching of the revealed
truths were contained in the Scripture,
exclusively, and sufficiently for
the immediate instruction of all the
faithful, the Scripture would clearly
and distinctly affirm this, and furnish
us with a description of itself or
canon specifying the books which are
inspired, duly authenticated by St.
John, the last of the apostles. It
does nothing of the kind, and the
moderators are forced to allude to
certain indirect references which are
made to the authority of the Scripture
in some of the sacred books.
These indirect statements are not
without their value as proofs of the
Catholic doctrine of inspiration, but
they by no means support the position
of the moderators. Our Lord
directs the unbelieving Jews to search
the Scriptures of the Old Testament,
because they testify of him, the living
teacher, as the Vicar of Christ now
points to the pages of the New Testament,
where Protestants may find the
proofs of his divine commission and
authority. St. Timothy is commended
as having studied the same Scriptures
of the old law, which made
him "wise unto salvation" by preparing
him to receive the oral teaching
of St. Paul. St. Peter incidentally
informs us that the epistles of St. Paul
are a portion of the inspired Scripture,
when he gives the caution to all who
read them that in them "<i>are some
things hard to be understood, which the
unlearned and unstable wrest, as also
the other Scriptures, to their own perdition</i>."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
All this is in perfect harmony
with the teachings of the Catholic
Church, as any one may see without
our taking the trouble to develop the
matter any further.</p>

<p>The promise of the Holy Spirit to
the faithful generally is not in the
least contrary to the doctrine of the
infallibility of the teaching church,
and the duty of obeying its decisions.
It is a necessary condition to the
participation in this light of the Holy
Spirit that an individual should be a
member of the body of Christ&mdash;the
church&mdash;in which the Spirit resides.
He must be instructed and baptized
in the faith, the true doctrine must be
given to him, the key to the sense of
the sacred writings must be furnished
him, the criterion of discernment between
true and false interpretations of
the revelation of Christ must exist in
his mind, in order that he may exercise
his judgment rightly. Under
these conditions, the private Christian
can possess the faith in himself in
such a way that he needs no man to
tell him what the true doctrine of
Christ is, and detects at once the
heresy of any false teacher, even
though he be a priest or bishop, who
attempts to preach his own new and
private opinions contrary to the
Catholic faith. This is that supernatural,
Catholic instinct pervading the
church and keeping the faithful loyal
to their religion, under the longest
and bloodiest persecutions, like those
which the Irish and the Poles have
endured with such martyr-like constancy.
This "unction from the Holy
One" was in the fathers of the first
six councils, by the confession of the
reverend doctors themselves, and in
the universal church which adhered
to the true faith attacked by the
Arian, Nestorian, and Monophysite
heretics. And if so, this same unction
must have enabled them to understand
the true doctrine of the apostles
on all other points of the Christian
faith, as well as on the Trinity and
Incarnation. If this unction is in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
true Christians, then they must all
believe alike, in all ages and all
places. Why, then, do the Presbyterian
divines reject the doctrines of the
fathers of the first six centuries, and
the doctrines of all Christendom during
these and subsequent centuries,
until the revolution of the sixteenth
century, concerning the sacraments,
the priesthood, and other matters of
the most essential character?</p>

<p>(3.) The third argument is, that the
doctrine of a human priesthood implies
a denial of the priesthood of
Jesus Christ, or of its sufficiency. We
are surprised to see such manifestly
inconsequent reasoning in a document
coming from a body of such high repute
for ability and learning as the
Presbyterian clergy. The affirmation
that the Bible is the word of God implies,
then, a rejection of Jesus Christ
as the Word of God, or a denial of
his sufficiency. The recognition of
human teachers and pastors implies,
then, the rejection of Jesus Christ as
the teacher and pastor, or the denial
of his sufficiency. What, then, are
the five thousand Presbyterian pastors
but so many usurpers of the titles
and offices of Jesus Christ? Christ
and the Holy Spirit are sufficient for
each man without any human intervention.
Away, then, with your
church, your sacraments, your assemblies,
your ministers, your confession
of faith, your bibles. Every man is
enlightened by the Holy Spirit, and
has unrestricted access to God
through Jesus Christ, as the fanatics
said in the time of Luther, who had
no argument by which he could refute
them, and was forced to call on the
princes to use the more efficacious
weapon of the sword, and to sweep
away the too consequent but most
unfortunate imitators of his own example
by a deluge of blood.</p>

<p>(4.) The fourth argument is, that
there can be no apostolic succession
in the church, because bishops do
not possess the gifts and perform the
miracles of the apostles. This argument
merely proves that the apostles
can have no successors in that which
was peculiar to themselves as founders
of the church, or fathers in the spiritual
order of the line of succession.
They alone received immediately from
Jesus Christ the revelation of Christian
faith and Christian law. Their
successors received this deposit from
their hands without any power to add
to it or take from it. There is no necessity
that the successors of the
apostles should receive by a new revelation
that which they have received
from the apostles themselves by tradition.
They need not the gifts necessary
to originate, but only those necessary
to preserve and continue the
work of Christ, committed to the
apostles. It is, therefore, no argument
against the infallibility of the
episcopate in preserving, proclaiming,
explaining, or protecting against contrary
errors the deposit of faith received
from the apostles, to say that
it lacks the immediate inspiration necessary
to an infallible proclamation
of revealed truths at first hand. The
miracles wrought by the apostles as
signs of their apostleship authenticate
this revelation as taught by their successors
to the end of time, and seal
the credentials of the episcopal line
which they founded throughout its
entire length without any new miracles.
As to the fact of the establishment
of the hierarchy containing the
three distinct grades of bishop, priest,
and deacon, deriving its power through
episcopal ordination from the apostles,
it is enough to refer to the learned
works of Protestant authors who have
fully proved it. Catholic authors do
not teach that bishops succeed to the
extraordinary apostolic office of the
apostles, but only to their episcopal
office. We hold that St. Peter alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
has successors to the plenitude of his
apostolic power, with the reservation
of so much as only the founder of the
line could or need exercise. To this
supremacy of the successor of St.
Peter the divines object still more
strongly than to the power of the
episcopate, that it substitutes the pope
in the place of Jesus Christ. It is
very hard to find by what logical process
this conclusion is reached. The
divines admit that St. Peter and the
apostles were the infallible teachers
and rulers of the church. If their
argument is sound, they cannot admit
this without substituting the apostles
in the place of Jesus Christ. If
the church could be governed by a
human, infallible authority for half a
century, without prejudice to the
supreme authority of Jesus Christ, it
could be governed for an indefinite
number of centuries in the same way,
without any such prejudice. It is
quite irrelevant to this side of the
question whether this authority is
exercised by one or by several, over
local churches or over the church of
the whole world, Christ is the head
of all particular churches as well as
of the church universal. If it is compatible
with this headship of Christ
that a man should be the pastor of a
single congregation, it is quite as much
so that he should be a pastor over a
diocese, over a province, over a nation,
over a collection of nations, or
over the whole world. The reverend
doctors have therefore confused the
issue. It is simply a question of fact
as to what constitution Jesus Christ
actually gave the church, and what
powers he delegated to his ministers.
The Presbyterians, on their own principles,
are bound to prove from the
New Testament alone that our Lord
did not give the church an episcopal
and papal constitution, but did give
it a Presbyterian polity. When they
made their case out against the Episcopalian
divines on the one side, and
against such Catholic authors as Archbishop
Kenrick, Mr. Allies, F. Bottalla,
and F. Weninger, on the other, it
will be time to listen to them, but not
sooner.</p>

<p>We have done with the arguments
of the reverend doctors, but we cannot
withhold an expression of surprise
at the signs of the divine sanction to
their principles which they appeal to,
apparently in lieu of the miracles
which are wanting, or of the four
marks by which the church used to
be known in the old times. That
men believing in total depravity and
election should appeal to the temporal
prosperity of nations&mdash;the mass of
whom, on their principles, are hopelessly
doomed to everlasting fire, there
to be tormented for ever, even for
those actions which the world calls
virtuous and brilliant&mdash;as a proof of
the divine favor, is somewhat strange.
We wonder they did not add, "Behold
we are rich and increased in goods;
in this great capital where we are assembled,
our churches are principally
in the upper portion of the city, handsomely
carpeted, richly cushioned, and
principally frequented by the wealthier
classes. Indeed, we are the church
both of the <i>élite</i> and of the elect."</p>

<p>We have done with the arguments
by which the reverend doctors sustain
their protest against the Roman
Church, and will devote the rest of
our space to a consideration of those
by which they sustain their claim to
be recognized as orthodox, Catholic
Christians. Their line of argument
is certainly remarkable, and must
strike many of their readers with
surprise. It is an attempt to take the
position held by the Catholic Church
during the first five or six centuries, to
identify their cause with that of the
early fathers and councils, to shelter
themselves under the ægis of a Catholic
creed, to use Catholic language,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
appropriate the Catholic name, and
make profession of adhering to Catholic
unity and the communion of the
Catholic Church. There must be a
wonderful charm and power about
this word when even Presbyterians
are compelled to bow before its majesty,
and to acknowledge that their
cause is lost if they cannot indicate
their right to inherit and blazon on
their escutcheon this glorious, world-subduing
title. "The name itself of
Catholic keeps me," says St. Augustine,
the favorite doctor of the Presbyterians.
The divines of the assemblies
are, therefore, compelled by the
very attitude they have taken, in
justifying themselves as orthodox believers
before the holy see, to claim
that appellation which was the distinctive
mark and sign of that ancient
body whose faith is acknowledged by
both sides as the standard and criterion
of orthodoxy. This language is,
however, evidently only adopted for
the occasion. It is not the natural,
ordinary phraseology of Presbyterians,
who are not accustomed to teach and
preach to their own adherents the necessity
of Catholic unity, communion in
the Catholic Church, agreement with
the first six councils, or to call their
doctrine the Catholic faith. These
words must have a definite meaning.
They are not mere phrases or pure
synonyms of other words equally significant
of the same ideas. Catholic
is not merely another name for true,
or scriptural, or apostolic. It will not
do for one to give out a system of
doctrine which he has constructed by
his own private judgment upon the
Scripture, or learned by a private illumination,
or taken from the writings
of a particular set of religious teachers,
and call it Catholic because he thinks
it is proved to be true, and ought to
be universally received. The term
Catholic includes in its signification
completeness and integrity of truth;
but its specific sense is concrete, visible
universality of outward profession,
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quod semper, quod ubique, quod
ab omnibus</i>, of Vincent of Lerins.
This universality in time and space is
the mark and outward manifestation
of the integral, divine truth, and those
who accept it and proclaim it as such
must necessarily hold that the indefectibility
of the visible church is
guaranteed by Almighty God. It is
unmeaning for those who hold that
the body of the visible church, as
organized under its legitimate pastors,
can apostatize from the pure faith of
the gospel, and the line of true believers
be continued invisibly, or in a
small, separated section of professed
Christians, to make use of the word
Catholic, or pretend to agree with
the fathers of the first six centuries
in their profession of Catholicity as
opposed to heresy. The marks of the
church, unity, sanctity, catholicity,
and apostolicity, if they are really
marks, as declared by all who profess
to be Catholics in the genuine, natural,
commonly accepted sense of the
word, must be so burnt into the object
they are intended to mark that they
are ineffaceable and easily read and
known by all men. The young
Mohican hero Uncas was recognized
by the aged Indian chief and prophet
Tamenund as the legitimate heir of
the noblest and most royal line of the
northern sachems, by the figure of
its sacred emblem, the tortoise, tattooed
upon his breast. The name <em>Catholic</em>
is, as it were, the <em>totem</em> which marks a
peculiar ecclesiastical race, descended
from the ancient fathers, indelibly
stamped upon its breast as the sure
sign of its legitimacy. It is in vain,
therefore, that the Presbyterian doctors
vaunt their acceptance of the
Catholic symbol, the Apostles' Creed,
including as one of its essential articles,
"I believe the holy, Catholic
Church." They do not believe this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
article in the Catholic sense, as understood
by the whole ancient church,
namely, as designating a well-known,
specific, visible body, and implying
a full belief of all the doctrines
authoritatively proclaimed by that
body. Among a thousand others
we take one text of St. Augustine,
which we have hit upon at random,
expressing this sense: "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Catholica
fides est autem hæc&mdash;constitutam ab
illo matrem ecclesiam, quæ Catholica
dicitur, ex eo quia universaliter perfecta
est, et in nullo claudicat, et per
totum orbem diffusa est.</span>" "The Catholic
faith is this&mdash;that the mother
church was constituted by him, which
is called Catholic, because it is universally
perfect, and is diffused through
the whole world."<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
Moreover, the
profession in general terms of holding
the Catholic faith, or the avowal even
of a creed completely orthodox, avails
nothing to those who are outside the
Catholic communion, and make their
orthodox profession a pretext for
keeping up a separate organization
in opposition to the legitimate pastors.
All the ancient separatists made a loud
outcry that they were true, genuine
Catholics. The modern ones, from
the Greeks to the Presbyterians, imitate
their example. There is a power
residing in that name which all acknowledge.
They feel that their
claim to be truly apostolic, orthodox
churches, holding the pure doctrine
and order established by the apostles
and apostolic men, will be utterly demolished
if they yield the title to
Catholicity. Hence they have tried
to arrogate it to themselves, and
to affix nicknames to the Catholic
Church. But their efforts have always
been in vain. When they are divested
of the disguises and borrowed raiment
which they throw around their own
proper form, the sign on their breast is
wanting, and none of the black paint
with which they strive to smear it
over can mar or cancel the indelible
imprint which the numberless lancets
of persecution have cut and
graven into the very flesh of the majestic
figure of the true body of the
Son of God. Hear once more St.
Augustine: "The Christian religion
must be held by us, and the communion
of that church which is Catholic,
and is called Catholic, not only by its
own members, but also by all its enemies.
For, whether they will or no,
the very heretics themselves and the
offspring of schisms, when they talk
not with their own friends, but with
people outside, call the Catholic
Church nothing else but Catholic.
For they cannot be understood unless
they designate her by that name by
which she is denominated by the whole
world."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>The profession of agreement with
the first six councils is equally fallacious.
Why the first six and not the
last twelve? The Catholic Church
receives all the eighteen councils with
equal veneration, and is now preparing
herself to celebrate the nineteenth,
which will have equal authority with
the first, because the fathers will be
equally congregated together in the
Holy Ghost, with the presence of
Christ in the midst of them, and the
inexhaustible virtue of his promise,
<i>Lo! I am with you always, even to
the consummation of the world</i>. The
separated bodies of Christians are
ranged in an ascending series of protesters
against these councils, who reject
a greater or lesser number according
to the date or reason of the judgment
pronounced in them against
their several errors. The Greeks reject
all but the first seven, the orthodox
Protestants all but six; the Monothelites
rejected the sixth, the Eutychians
the fourth, the Nestorians the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
third, the Macedonians the second,
the Arians the first, in which they are
followed by the modern Unitarians.
It is evident enough that there is a
principle of consanguinity binding
together all these families, from those
who reject the Council of Nice to
those who repudiate the Council of
the Vatican. The Catholic Church
is marked by the unbroken continuity
of &oelig;cumenical councils. The other
churches reject as many of these
councils as seems good in their eyes,
and accept the decisions of the others
because they are in accordance with
their own opinions. They do not
submit to the councils; they judge
them, and ratify such of them as they
approve. The profession made by
the Presbyterian doctors of receiving
six councils amounts, therefore, to
nothing as a plea in defence of their
orthodoxy. Upon their own principle,
they might just as rightfully reject
these six councils as the seventh.
They really reject and deny their
authority as councils, they repudiate
the very principle on which they
were constituted, and affirm their own
supreme right to judge. They acknowledge
the truth of the doctrines which
they defined; but it is purely on the
ground that these doctrines agree
with their own private opinions respecting
the sense of the New Testament.
The whole of this portion of
the letter, in which the Presbyterian
doctors attempt to use Catholic
phraseology, is evidently nothing but
a piece of special pleading. They
do not venture the assertion that the
church of the period of the six councils&mdash;that
is, the three centuries and a
half between the years 325 and 680&mdash;was
identical in doctrine or discipline
with the Presbyterian Church of the
United States, which they represent.
Nevertheless, they seem to wish to
leave the impression on the minds of
their readers that the fathers, the
councils, the common belief and practice
of those ages sustain their cause.
The editorial comment in the <cite>Evangelist</cite>
boldly asserts that such is the
case. The small number of scholars
well read in patristic theology who
are found among the Presbyterian
clergy will probably not risk their reputation
for learning or put at hazard
the success of their cause by any such
rash statement. As a general rule,
however, the Presbyterian clergy and
theological students, though well-educated
scholars in the college curriculum
and certain special professional
branches taught at the seminaries,
have not turned their attention
to ancient Christian history and literature.
They know much more about
Turretin than they do about St. Augustine.
It is quite probable, therefore,
that a very general impression prevails
among them, that they are really
on the whole in conformity with the
doctrine of the great fathers of the
ancient church. This is a delusion
which a little study of the original
works of the fathers themselves would
soon dissipate. We could not desire
any thing more efficacious for this
purpose than the study of St. Augustine,
called by Luther the greatest
teacher whom God had given to the
church since the days of the apostles,
and revered in a most remarkable way
by all those who follow the Lutheran
and Calvinistic confessions.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
The
deeply learned men and independent
thinkers among Protestants understand
this well, and the notion of the
half-learned sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries that Protestantism can take
its stand on the era of the first six
councils is a mere remnant of mist
that hangs for a while over portions
of the landscape, but is destined soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
to disappear before advancing light.
St. Augustine is diametrically opposed
to the first principle of Presbyterianism
and all Protestantism, that principle
which is the dominant idea of
the Presbyterian reply to the Pope.</p>

<p>He says, "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non crederem Evangelio
nisi me commoveret Ecclesiæ
Catholicæ auctoritas</span>," "I would not
believe the gospel unless the authority
of the Catholic Church moved me
to do it."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
Prof. Reuss, of the Protestant
theological faculty in the
University of Strasburg, says that
"St. Augustine's principles come to
their result in this famous saying, diametrically
opposed to the fundamental
principle of all Protestant theology."<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
Julius Müller, another professor in
the same faculty, says of all the fathers:
"This must be openly admitted
by every unprejudiced historical investigation,
that not merely the ecclesiastical
theology of the middle ages,
but even the patristic theology of the
fourth, fifth, and sixth centuries, are,
upon every point that is a matter
of dispute between Catholicism and
Protestantism, more on the side of the
former than of the latter."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Presbyterians cannot make any
thing by an appeal from the Council
of Trent to the first six councils.
They have no connection either by
continuity of thought or succession
with historical Christianity, and their
only resource is to maintain that the
true interpretation of the gospel,
which was lost before the Council of
Nice assembled under the auspices of
Constantine, has been restored by
Calvin, Luther, and Knox. How
they can account for the fact that the
church which, on their theory, had
subverted the apostolic church, was
unerring in its definitions of the great
dogmas of the Trinity, Incarnation,
Original Sin, and Grace, is only known
to themselves. It is only by a happy
inconsistency that orthodox Protestants
have preserved that portion of
the Catholic faith which they have
received by tradition from their ancestors.
The true Protestant principle
of individualism necessarily
tends to master the contrary principle
of faith in the minds of Protestants,
and to produce the doubt, the
denial, the hostility to all positive
dogmas which marks the most advanced
rationalism. All this was
working in Luther himself, whose
brain contained the seeds of the bitter
fruit which has ripened in the minds
of his followers in our day. He himself
was the prey of doubt, and gave
utterance to the strongest expression
concerning the absurdity of the principal
doctrines of his own system.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
Thrown upon the discussion of what
the Scripture is, and what it means,
with nothing to appeal to but private
judgment, Presbyterianism, or any
other form of Protestantism, has nothing
to look forward to but an endless
shock and collision of conflicting
opinions, which can have no other
effect than the resolution of the whole
mass into its component atoms.</p>

<p>We have concluded our remarks
upon the reply of the Presbyterian
moderators to the pope's letter. While
we have been forced to point out distinctly
that the principle of its protest
against the doctrine and authority of
the Roman Church is totally subversive
of all faith, yet we willingly acknowledge
that some of the most
sacred and fundamental dogmas of
faith are held and professed by the
respectable bodies in whose name it
was written. Their doctrine is like a
superb ancient <i>torso</i> to which plaster
limbs and head have been added.
Although their principle is equally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
destructive of all faith with that of
the Arians, yet we by no means regard
them in the same light. The
authors of heresies who mutilate the
faith are very different from those who
receive and hold with reverence this
mutilated faith. Their intellectual and
moral worth, their philanthropy and
zeal for God, the value of many most
excellent works which they have written
in defence of the divine revelation,
we fully appreciate. That great numbers
have been and are in the spiritual
communion of the Catholic Church
we sincerely hope. We desire that the
schism which has separated them from
our visible communion may be healed,
not only for their own spiritual good,
but also that the Catholic Church in
the United States may be strengthened
by the accession of that intellectual
and religious vigor which such
a great mass of baptized Christians
contains in itself. Above all things, we
desire that all who acknowledge our
Lord Jesus Christ as their Lord and
Sovereign should be united in mind,
and heart, and effort, in order that his
universal kingdom over the nations
of the earth may be established as
speedily and as completely as possible.</p>

<h2>A HERO, OR A HEROINE?</h2>


<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />

A HERO.</h3>

<p>"You say he is handsome?"</p>

<p>"No; I said he was nice-looking,
and gentlemanly, as of course Philip's
cousin would be. But you know I
judge only from a photograph."</p>

<p>"How vain you are of your lover,
Jessie! You would be just as proud
of him if he had not his handsome
face, of course?"</p>

<p>"Of course I would."</p>

<p>"I will not marry a handsome
man! However, tell me some more
about the cousin. Why should he
bury himself at Shellbeach? I
should think a man of any aspiration
could not endure such a contracted
life. I suppose he is as gossiping
and weak-minded as a country minister."</p>

<p>"My dear Margaret!"</p>

<p>"I know you think me uncharitable.
The truth is, men exasperate me;
and then remember I am twenty-five
and not engaged."</p>

<p>"You have no one to blame except
yourself."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that. Is it
my fault that young men are all
alike, and inexpressibly wearisome?
Seriously, I am tired of being Miss
Lester, and mean to change my condition.
Why do you look at me in
that peculiar manner?"</p>

<p>"I was wondering how you would
suit the doctor."</p>

<p>"Does he want to be suited?"</p>

<p>"I should think so, from his letter."</p>

<p>"Jessie, give it to me this moment.
I must see it."</p>

<p>"I will not give it to you. I will
read you something he says. No,
you are not to look over my shoulder;
sit down peaceably, or else I
shall put the letter in my pocket."</p>

<p>"Why Jessie, what is the matter
with you? I never saw you so dignified
in all my life. I suppose the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
letter is all about Philip, and that is
why you choose to keep it to yourself.
Well, here I am, meek as a
lamb, actually submitting to you. It
is too absurd!"</p>

<p>With these words, Margaret, who
had seated herself on a sofa near
her friend, jumped up, seized the
letter and tore it open, while Jessie
held out her hands imploringly,
but did not offer to resist her impetuous
companion. Margaret glanced
at the first two pages.</p>

<p>"Philip, Philip. Don't be alarmed;
I would not be hired to read it. Let
me see; what is this? 'Why was not
I fortunate enough to have you myself?'
Aha! you have two irons in
the fire, you artful little creature?"</p>

<p>"Don't be silly, Margaret, but read
on."</p>

<p>"I don't know about this; I shall
not scruple to warn Philip, if you
are getting yourself into trouble.
What comes next? 'But since so
charming a companion is beyond my
reach, cannot you undertake to find
me some one as much like you as
possible, or at least just as nice, who
would not be afraid of a quiet, hard-working
life with a poor doctor, in
the dullest of country towns? A
sweet temper is, of course, the first requirement;
moderate personal attractions;
some sense and experience,
and a little money for herself. Of
course I want a great many more
things, but these will do for the present.
So if you know of a young
woman, strong and healthy&mdash;to think
that a doctor should have almost forgotten
those important items!&mdash;send
her down here, will you? and I will
marry her on the spot.' Well, I will
not read any more of your letter,
unless there are any more of this
modest man's requirements. But seriously,
Jessie, I think I would do
very well for him, and you may write
and tell him I am coming."</p>

<p>"Margaret, of course you are in
fun? How can you look so sober?
You would not surely mean any thing
so improper."</p>

<p>"I am in very earnest, and really
it is quite refreshing to be so. I am
tired out with my third season of
balls, operas, Germans, and all that
kind of nonsense, and I would like
to see a little of real life. I have
not quite made up my mind what I
will do; but I will go up-stairs for an
hour, and then I will tell you what
to write to the doctor. My good
old aunty shall be favored with a
long visit from her niece, whom she
has not seen for five years; and in
the mean time, you are not to say one
word to your mother or to any one
else. Do you hear, Jessie? Come,
promise me."</p>

<p>The promise was given, and Jessie
was left in great perplexity for nearly
two hours, when a message was
brought her that Miss Lester would
be glad to see her up-stairs. She
found her friend at a little writing-table,
in a sort of boudoir between
their rooms, where the girls used to
work and read in the mornings, and
receive calls from their intimate
friends.</p>

<p>"There!" said Margaret, rising as
she entered; "sit down there, Jessie,
and read what I have written; you
are to copy it in your answer to the
doctor's letter. Read it aloud to me;
I want to hear how it sounds."</p>

<p>Jessie read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I highly approve of your wish to marry,
and think I can help you in the matter. I
have some one in my mind that comes pretty
well up to your different requirements&mdash;at
least those you have specified; for of
course I cannot pretend to answer for the
'great many more things' which you want,
but have not mentioned. Moreover, this
young woman is a dear friend of mine, and
is willing to marry, if she can be satisfied.
She says she will go to Shellbeach and stay
with a relation, in order to see and to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
seen, on condition that you will be at her
disposal to a reasonable degree during her
visit, which she will limit to six months,
and that, at the end of that time, you will
write her a true statement of how you
stand affected toward her. On her part,
she will promise to marry you, if by that
time you both desire it. I may as well tell
you that her name is Margaret Lester, and
that she will stay with old Miss Spelman,
with whom you are on such friendly terms.
This whole matter, you will understand, is
to rest between you, Miss Lester, and myself."</p></blockquote>

<p>Jessie was too much accustomed
to her friend's eccentricities to be
very much astonished by this unexpected
termination to their morning's
conversation. She disapproved, however,
of the whole affair, and remonstrated
as strongly as she dared; but
she had grown to defer to Margaret's
stronger will, and now felt it impossible
to oppose her. "Besides," as Margaret
said, "what could be more natural
than that she should go to stay with
old Aunt Selina? It was only what
she ought to have done before."
And, to crown all, Jessie was informed
that a letter had been already
written and sent to Miss Spelman,
and Margaret intended to go, at any
rate.</p>

<p>The discussion lasted some time,
and ended by Jessie's unwillingly
placing herself at the desk and writing
a letter, which, though it contained
the exact words of the copy given
above, also enlarged, in Jessie's own
affectionate language, on her friend's
good qualities, attractions, and popularity,
and had nearly alluded to the
very handsome income, which would
so far exceed the doctor's not unreasonable
demand. But that Margaret
cut short; it was enough, she said, that
he should believe her to have a little
pin-money; for of course he would
expect to support the family, if he
had any spirit, and if he had not, she
would have nothing to do with him.
Poor Jessie groaned over Margaret's
downright speeches, but did not attempt
to change her decision. The
letter was at last sealed and sent, and
Jessie could only wonder at Margaret's
high spirits for the rest of the
day. She had never looked handsomer,
or been more amusing, or
played more finely than on that evening,
when Mrs. Edgar gave a little
party. She was so kind to the young
men, that they all were charmed with
her and with themselves, and quite
expanded under the warmth of her
bright smiles.</p>

<p>Jessie, on the contrary, was preoccupied
and distressed. She felt uncomfortable
at what she had done, at
the thought of the secret she was
keeping from her mother, and troubled
when she remembered the approaching
separation from her friend.
How she wished Margaret were not
so hard to please! Why could she
not like that pleasant Mr. Lothrop,
who was so handsome, so rich, and
who would so gladly have availed
himself of the smallest encouragement
to make her an offer? How
kindly she smiled on him to-night!
Why couldn't she be satisfied with
pleasing him? And then what was
the chance that this fastidious girl
would take a fancy to Dr. James,
whom, though she had never seen,
she believed to be plain and unattractive?
What could come of it,
except trouble for the poor man?
Of course he would fall in love with
Margaret, while she would think of
nothing but amusing herself. "And
I shall have been the instrument of
bringing disappointment and unhappiness
to Philip's cousin and dearest
friend."</p>

<p>All these thoughts kept Jessie in a
very unenviable state of mind during
the evening, and she was thankful
when she could escape to her own
room, and write a long letter, before
going to bed, to her absent lover; of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
course not disclosing Margaret's secret,
but disburdening her mind of
many anxieties on her friend's account.</p>

<p>While the answers to the letters
written in so impulsive a manner are
being expected with some impatience,
a few words should be said
on the history and circumstances of
Margaret Lester, about whom a good
deal is to be written in these pages.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />
PRELIMINARY.</h3>

<p>Margaret's mother died when she
was about fourteen years old, and her
father, unwilling to take the direction
of his daughter's education, placed
her at an excellent boarding-school,
where no expense was spared to give
her every advantage, and where, being
perfectly happy, she remained until
she was nineteen. It was at this
school that she formed the friendship
with Jessie Edgar which was afterward
to be so great a benefit to her.
Jessie was the second daughter of a
wealthy New York family, and it
was at her home that Margaret passed
her first Christmas vacation, and
all her succeeding holidays.</p>

<p>Jessie's gentle, yielding nature
found great enjoyment in Margaret's
boldness and self-reliance, and Margaret,
who began by protecting and
supporting the other's timidity and
shyness, ended by heartily admiring
and loving her sweet and unselfish
room-mate. They became "inseparables,"
in school-girl phrase, and
when school-days were over, and Mr.
Lester thought that the best completion
to his daughter's education would
be a little travelling, Jessie's mother
consented to her accompanying her
dear friend. For two years they
visited beautiful places together, and
felt their friendship drawn more closely,
as their sympathies became enlarged.</p>

<p>But this happy experience came to
a sudden and sorrowful end. Mr.
Lester had a dreadful fall while they
were coming down a mountain, and,
after lingering a few weeks in extreme
suffering, died, leaving the two girls
quite alone in a foreign land. They
had a sad journey home; he had
been the life and soul of their expedition,
and, having travelled a good
deal before, had been able to be the
pleasantest kind of guide for them.
It had been hard to prevail on Margaret
to leave the Swiss town where
he lay buried in the little graveyard;
but Jessie's love prevailed,
and they came safely back together
to Mrs. Edgar's hospitable house.
Once there, the kind friends would
not let Margaret think of leaving
them, and she had grown to consider
the pleasant house almost as her own
home.</p>

<p>It was long before she recovered
her high spirits, but at twenty-three
she was induced to go into society
with Jessie, who had waited for her.
She was, from every point of view, a
desirable match&mdash;young, rich, and
fine-looking; gay and good-humored.
Pleased with herself and her surroundings,
she thoroughly enjoyed her first
season, and was unmistakably a
belle. The next year, however, was
a disappointment; there was a sameness
in her life and amusements that
became irritating to her. Jessie was
engaged to be married, and Margaret
found herself jealous of her
friend's divided confidence. But,
though she said to Jessie that she
would like to follow her example,
"to be able to sympathize with lovers'
rhapsodies," like the princess in
the fairy-tale, she found fault with all
her admirers; criticised them, nicknamed
them, and discouraged their
attentions as soon as these became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
exclusive. A very gay summer at a
fashionable watering-place followed
this wearisome winter, and Margaret
entered upon her third season
disposed for any thing but enjoyment.
No one who saw her in society
would have guessed her real
character. High-spirited, gay, liking
to astonish and slightly shock her
friends by her behavior, a little of
what is termed "a trainer," there lay
underneath this careless exterior a
depth of real sentiment that only one
or two people whom she truly loved
were aware of. To be loved for herself,
and to love, were her aspirations.</p>

<p>First, she was perfectly aware of
her own attractions, and believed she
could have almost any man of her
acquaintance, if she should choose to
make herself agreeable to him; but
she could not believe in any one's
disinterested attachment to her.</p>

<p>"They all know I am rich," she
would say to Jessie; "they would not
take me and poverty. Now, I would
be glad, if I were poor, to marry a
poor man; then I could believe in
his love, and we could have some
trials to bear together."</p>

<p>Secondly, she earnestly wished to
love; but this, with her, meant a
great deal. She wanted to look up
to some one, to honor and believe in
him; she thought of this much more
than of the sentiment; for she knew
she should find that with the rest.
She was tired of taking the lead, and
of having her own way. How gladly
would she submit herself to a noble
guide! She imagined herself almost
as a queen stepping down from her
throne, resigning sceptre and authority,
and saying, with Miss Procter,</p>

<p class="center">
"Love trusts; and for ever he gives, and gives all."<br />
</p>

<p>"But these young men," she said
to Jessie, "are so intensely matter-of-fact!
They would think my brain
softening, if they knew what I wanted
and expected to find." At another
time she said, "If I could only
find something a little different! I
think I will go to Australia, marry a
squatter, and see all the queer animals.
My money would be worth
while out there."</p>

<p>It has been said that Margaret had a
maiden aunt living at Shellbeach, her
mother's only sister. This lady she
had seen but once since her return
from abroad, when Miss Spelman
came to New York on purpose to
take her niece home with her. Margaret,
however, was not willing to
leave the Edgars, and so her aunt returned
to Shellbeach, a little offended
by her niece's preferring strangers to
her own flesh and blood, but, on the
whole, perhaps relieved that her
quiet home was not to be invaded
by a person of so startling a character
as she conceived Margaret to be.
A visit had been agreed upon between
them; but this had been declined
and deferred so many times
that the old lady, again offended, had
given up proposing it. If it had not
been for Margaret's curiosity about
Jessie's friend, Doctor James, she
certainly would not have remembered
her duty to her mother's only sister;
while it is equally true that, if
it had not been for that convenient
relative, she could not for a moment
have entertained the idea of taking the
lion (that is, the doctor) by storm
in his den. For of any likelihood of
being captivated herself in this adventure,
it must be acknowledged,
she had no thought. Her curiosity,
her strongest weak point, was thoroughly
excited about this doctor.
That a man with a fine education, a
profession, and enough money to
live respectably, (all which information
she had obtained from her
friend,) should isolate himself in a
stupid little sea-side town, because
he liked to do so and enjoyed it, was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
her a mystery which demanded to be
cleared up at once. How she should
like to astonish this hermit! How
she would dress! How she would
shock his ideas of propriety, if he had
any! He would be surprised and
overpowered, of course, and then&mdash;well,
then she would beat a graceful
retreat, and come back to Jessie's
wedding in the best of spirits.</p>

<p>"I shall take Cécile and the Marchioness
and Jimmy, and you will see
that we shall have an exciting time.
I shall make myself so delightful to
dear Aunt Selina that she will not
hear of my staying less than six
months; and I shall study housekeeping,
economy, and medicine, and experiment
on Cécile when she is sick."</p>

<p>"Why do you take the Marchioness?"</p>

<p>"How can you ask? I must have
exercise; and who knows but I may
make myself useful by visiting the
distant patients when the doctor's
horse is tired?"</p>

<p>"But why not take Lady Jane?
She is much handsomer."</p>

<p>"She is too fine for my purpose.
I don't want to seem wealthy, you
know; and the Marchioness goes
mousing along, her head level with
her tail, in true Morgan style, and
looks any thing but extravagant.
Then Jimmy will keep us awake, and
bark at Aunt Selina's cats when
other excitement fails."</p>

<p>"How do you know she has any
cats?"</p>

<p>"Of course she has cats! Half a
dozen, I have no doubt. Who ever
heard of an ancient maiden living
alone without cats? How I wish
the answers would come!"</p>

<p>They did come, in due time;
Miss Spelman's first, cordially welcoming
her niece to Shellbeach
for any length of time, or for good
and all. Margaret felt rather ashamed,
as she saw how her aunt had fallen
into the trap, and how completely
her own good faith had been taken
for granted. She mentally resolved
that, if it depended on her, Miss
Spelman should not repent her generosity;
she would make herself as
delightful as she could, cheerfully
give up her own convenience, if necessary,
and make up for her long
neglect of so disinterested a relation.</p>

<p>This letter arrived on the third
day of expectation; the doctor's, not
until a full week had elapsed. "A
doctor's time is not his own, and the
number of invalids at Shellbeach has
been greater than usual." It would
be well to give the letter in full, at
least so much of it as relates to Margaret
and her proposition.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If it were the first of April," wrote the
doctor, "I should find no difficulty in comprehending
your letter; as it is not, I am
inclined to believe that I am being 'sold;'
but I do not believe practical jokes are in
your line, and you write apparently in good
earnest. Therefore, if your original friend
seriously recommends such an experiment
as this, I can but acquiesce, of course.
Miss Spelman also informs me that her
niece 'is coming;' so I feel that any opinion
I may express on the subject is superfluous.
However, it seems to me that there should
be an equality of position in this matter,
and I will say that I agree to Miss Lester's
terms, provided she agrees to mine. I
have but one condition, and it is her own:
that at the end of the time she appoints she
will, simultaneously with me, that is, at a
given hour, write me 'a true statement of
how she stands affected toward me'&mdash;which
means, of course, tell me honestly if she
loves me. I have a right to say that I
think this plan doubtful in its purpose, its
practicability, and its probable results."</p></blockquote>

<p>Not a word more was given to the
subject; the letter spoke briefly of
Philip, of Jessie, and terminated.</p>

<p>Margaret of course saw this letter
in the same forcible way that she
saw the other. Jessie thought she
would be offended, and so she was,
but that did not have the result Jessie
secretly hoped for.</p>

<p>"He is not well-bred, and evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
thinks a great deal of himself.
How I shall enjoy snubbing him!"</p>

<p>"You are going?"</p>

<p>"I should think so! Do you suppose
I shall disappoint Aunt Selina
for such rudeness as this? But I
will have no more second-hand dealings."
And so saying, she seized pen
and paper, and wrote as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dr. James</span>: I accept your condition.
Six months from next Monday, which will
be July 18th, at eleven o'clock in the evening,
we will write our letters.</p>

<p class="signature">
"<span class="smcap">Margaret Lester.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Jessie was not allowed to see this
note, which was at once dispatched
to Shellbeach.</p>

<p>"And now," Margaret said,
"comes the fun of arrangements.
We will go up-stairs and consult
about my clothes, and all that I
shall take with me."</p>


<h3>CHAPTER III.<br />
PASSENGERS FOR SHELLBEACH.</h3>

<p>Dr. James's letter had been received
on Tuesday; the following Monday,
at about three o'clock on a
bleak and gray January afternoon,
Margaret, accompanied by her maid
and terrier dog, arrived at the little
way-station of Shellbeach, and ascertaining
that Miss Spelman's carriage
had not arrived, walked into the
little waiting-room and to the airtight
stove, which was, however,
barely warm. Her teeth chattered,
and she stamped her feet and rubbed
her hands; the French maid followed,
bearing bag and shawls, shivering
and casting forlorn glances around
her. The little dog alone seemed in
good spirits, and ran about, inquiring
into every thing, and snuffled suspiciously
at a man who sat wrapped in
a shawl, reading a book, and at two
small boys, who were partaking of
frost which they scraped off the windows.</p>

<p>"Well, we're all frozen, so it's no
use saying it's cold," said Margaret,
walking about the room; "but I'm
famished, and as cross as a bear."</p>

<p>"O mademoiselle! it is terrible,"
cried Cécile, with a sort of little
shriek.</p>

<p>"It is a forlorn place, certainly;
let me see if my provisions are exhausted,"
Margaret said, taking the
bag. The little boys at the window
became deeply interested, and paused
in their unsatisfactory repast.</p>

<p>"One seed-cake! How exciting!
What! you want it, do you? Well,
take it," she said to the little dog,
who jumped upon her, and while he
devoured it she watched him, saying
reflectively, "Little pig! if I were
dying of starvation, and it were my
last crumb, he would eat it. How
do I look, Cécile? I am all covered
with cinders."</p>

<p>"Yes, mademoiselle; you look like
a fright."</p>

<p>Margaret smiled, and returned to
the platform, where she made inquiries
of a man who was looking helplessly
at her trunks how they were
to be got to Miss Spelman's. Having
arranged that matter, she asked,</p>

<p>"Can't I have that buggy to drive
up in? Does it belong to the man inside
there?"</p>

<p>"It belongs to him," said the driver,
with a grin, and Margaret turned
away in despair.</p>

<p>"The train was early," said a boy
standing by, "and perhaps the
young lady's team will be along
soon."</p>

<p>Margaret, who had her purse in
her hand, at once presented the boy
with twenty-five cents, as an acknowledgment
for the ray of encouragement
he had volunteered. He bore
it philosophically, and she returned
to the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cécile, it's only two miles to Miss
Spelman's; suppose we walk; it will
be warmer than waiting here. Give
me the bag, and you take the shawls,
and we will inquire the way."</p>

<p>She accompanied these words with
a look of indignation at the man
who was fortunate enough to have a
buggy at his command; but to her
great surprise, he rose, and, approaching
her, said:</p>

<p>"The train was early, and I expected
Miss Spelman's carryall; but
it is evidently not coming, and you
must manage with my buggy."</p>

<p>"You are Doctor James?" said
Margaret with an inquisitive look.</p>

<p>"You are right; and you are Miss
Lester," he replied. "I am sorry
you have had to wait in the cold;
but when I saw you had a companion,
I thought it would be wiser to
wait for the carryall. Miss Spelman
said she should probably send; but
asked me, at any rate, to meet you.
I will drive you home and come back
for your maid."</p>

<p>"But it's so cold here, and Cécile
feels the cold more than I. Could
we not possibly go three in the buggy?
Would it be too much for the
horse?"</p>

<p>The doctor smiled for the first
time; he was pleased by her thought
for her maid.</p>

<p>"You and I are good-sized people,
but she is small. I think Rosanna
can stand the weight; but it will not
do to start cold. I propose we go
over to the store and get thoroughly
warmed."</p>

<p>"Oh! delightful," cried Margaret,
"the thought of being warm again
is almost too much for me."</p>

<p>The doctor led the way across the
railroad track to a kind of variety
store, where there was certainly no
reason to complain of the cold.
The air was stifling, and conveyed
to Margaret's sense of smell the impressions
of soap, molasses, peppermint
drops, brown paper, and onions,
at one breath; but she was too grateful
to be warm even to make a face,
which under other circumstances
she would doubtless have done.
Seated in chairs before the energetic
little stove, she and Cécile toasted
hands and feet while the doctor went
for the horse. When he returned,
they were quite ready to start, and
the bag being stowed away in the
box, they put on all their wrappings,
by the doctor's advice, and packed
themselves into the buggy. Jimmy
curled himself under his mistress's
feet, the buffalo robe was well tucked
in, and the sturdy-looking mare started
with her load with a willingness
which showed she too was glad to
have her face toward home. It was
cold enough in spite of their comfortable
start, and, to make matters
worse, Margaret's veil blew away;
but she would not have alluded
to it for the world. The doctor
seemed absorbed in his driving,
and Cécile occupied with
her aching toes; and allowing it to
escape seemed to her so feminine
and weak-minded a proceeding that
she bore the cutting wind in silence
rather than expose her carelessness.
Her gratitude to the doctor for rescuing
her from her uncomfortable
situation, and the genial feelings produced
by her warming at the stove,
now gave way to reflections on this
man's previous behavior, as he sat
wrapped in his shawl, in the cold
little waiting-room. What a hard-hearted,
outrageous monster he must
be! Why did he not speak at once,
and be sympathetic and kind? Of
course he was studying her, and no
doubt criticising her, at that unfavorable
moment. It chafed her to
think to what an inspection she had
been exposed, and how utterly she
had been at a disadvantage. At last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
she broke the silence by saying abruptly,</p>

<p>"Does not extreme hunger add to
one's capacity for being cold?"</p>

<p>She intended to embarrass him by
reminding him of his profession, but
she was disappointed; for he answered
at once, with a slight movement
of his mouth, not however a smile,</p>

<p>"Extreme hunger? Yes; especially
such as the poor feel, who may have
tasted nothing for two or three days,
nor meat for as many months. How
long is it since you breakfasted?"</p>

<p>"At eight," she replied shortly.</p>

<p>The doctor, remembering with a
little compunction that he had both
breakfasted and dined, hastened to
say,</p>

<p>"That is a long time for a person
accustomed to regular meals. I am
quite sure you will find a better reception
in the matter of dinner than
you experienced at the station."</p>

<p>"I do not understand why my
aunt did not send for me."</p>

<p>"Nor I; she said to me, 'I shall
send the carryall, if possible; but you
will oblige me by meeting my niece,
and if any thing should happen to
prevent my man's being there, you
will bring her home.' I am sure
only you and the dog were expected."</p>

<p>"Yes, I said my maid would probably
come in a day or two; but she
was able to get ready to accompany
me."</p>

<p>Then there was silence once more,
till Dr. James drew up his horse before
a well-clipped, flourishing hedge, and,
getting out, opened a small brown
gate, and carried the bag and shawls
up the neat gravelled path. The
short afternoon had come to a close,
though it was scarcely four o'clock,
and the firelight shone pleasantly
out from the windows, where the
curtains were drawn aside. The
doctor deposited the wrappings on
the steps, said hastily, "Good-by,
Miss Lester, I shall call on you as
soon as possible," and was in his
buggy and driving quickly away before
she had time to utter a word.
She had stood for a moment, expecting
the door to be thrown open at
once; she even wondered that her
aunt was not awaiting her on the
threshold; but as no one appeared,
she gave the bell a rather decided
pull. Instantly the door was opened
by the neatest of maids, in a white
apron, who beamed upon the guests
while she took the bag and shawls.
Margaret walked at once toward the
bright fire, which shone out of an
open door, and there in the middle
of the room stood a little lady, who
met and embraced her, saying in an
agitated voice,</p>

<p>"Welcome, my dearest niece, a
thousand times!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, aunt; I am almost
perished! How pleasant the fire
looks!"</p>

<p>Miss Spelman was trembling in
every limb, but Margaret's decided
tones, quite free from emotion of any
kind, composed her. She drew an
easy-chair to the fire, and then turned
to Cécile, who stood hesitating in
the hall.</p>

<p>"You brought your maid, did you
not, dear Margaret? That is good;
it will make you more at home.
Ann, I hope you will make Miss
Lester's maid quite comfortable.
Her name, my dear? Oh! yes, Cecilia."
And as the woman disappeared,
she continued, "I am glad you have
so respectable and steady an attendant,
my dear; when I heard she was
French, I feared she might be very
dressy and flippant, and get restless
in our quiet little household."</p>

<p>She gently helped Margaret to lay
aside her things; then, as she seated
herself in the comfortable chair and
held out hands and feet to the grateful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
flame, the little lady once more
placed her hand on her shoulder, and
kissed her forehead.</p>

<p>"For all the world like your poor
father," she said softly. As Margaret
was silent, she continued, "But I
must tell you why I did not send for
you. I beg your pardon, my dear
child, for such apparent neglect.
The fact is, I have a new man, and
dare not trust him alone with the
horses, and I have a cold and was
afraid to go out this raw day. If it
had been milder, nothing should have
kept me at home; but as I had asked
our good doctor to meet you, I
knew you would really be provided
for. Then, I thought it would seem
so uncourteous to let him give his
valuable time to going to the station
for you, and then disappoint him of
the pleasure of bringing you home.
You see, I did not look for your
maid. O dear! how very rude
you must think me." And the poor
lady stopped short, quite appalled at
her own conduct, the impropriety of
which for the first time impressed her.</p>

<p>"No matter now, aunt, I'm safely
here."</p>

<p>"And thankful I am to have you,
dear; but to think that I should
have allowed you to drive home
alone with a strange young man!"</p>

<p>"I was not alone with him."</p>

<p>"But I did not know that; and,
O dear me! how did you all get
here?"</p>

<p>"Why, sandwiched, three in the
buggy, of course; Cécile in the middle;
it was the shortest way. He
wanted to bring first me and then
Cécile, but I would not let him.
However, don't worry about it now,
aunty. I would like to go to my
room, I think, and make myself presentable;
I am covered with cinders."</p>

<p>"Certainly. You will find a fire
there, and, I hope, every thing you
want. If not, you must let me
know." So saying, Miss Spelman
led the way up-stairs to a good-sized
room, where a little wood fire was
burning and candles were lighted.
The trunks were already there, and
Cécile was unpacking and laying
out what her mistress would want.</p>

<p>"We have tea, generally, at six;
but I have ordered it to-day at five,
for I know you need both dinner and
tea. Cecilia will find me down-stairs
if you want any thing." With
these words, Miss Spelman withdrew
and closed the door.</p>

<p>"I have arrived at that period
of starvation," remarked Margaret,
"when I am resigned to wait indefinitely
for my food, provided it comes
at last." At that moment a knock
announced Ann, who brought in a
waiter with cup and saucer and tea-things.
"Miss Spelman thought a
cup of tea would be warming."</p>

<p>Very soon Margaret was sitting in
her wrapper and slippers, in a little
rocking-chair, sipping her hot tea,
while Cécile brushed and arranged
her hair. She began to feel fatigued;
but that was rather a delightful sensation,
now that she had nothing to
do but rest and be comfortable. Before
five, she went down to the parlor,
where her aunt once more received
her with a little speech, and
then came the looked-for tea-dinner.
It appeared that Miss Spelman knew
what was good as well as Mrs. Edgar,
and Margaret, as she surveyed the
well-spread table, the spotless linen,
the shining glass and silver, the temptingly
brown chicken before her, the
spongy biscuit and delicate cake, was
glad to find that, at least, she would
not starve.</p>

<p>"I begin to feel a sea-air appetite
already," she exclaimed; "and O
aunty! how good every thing tastes."</p>

<p>Miss Selina was pleased, for she
was a hospitable hostess; and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
she and Margaret were established
before the fire, curtains drawn, and
the lamp shining brightly, there was
a mutual good feeling between them,
which, from that time, nothing disturbed.
Margaret, as she leaned
back in her chair, holding a little
screen before her face, had now time
to examine her aunt more closely, and
she studied her with considerable
curiosity. She was decidedly <i>petite</i>,
and so very neat and trim about her
dress that she made Margaret think
of a fairy godmother. Her hair was
white, although she was not yet sixty;
she wore a cap, and soft lace round
her throat; her eyes were dark and
bright, and her smile very sweet and
cheerful. She must have been pretty,
Margaret thought, and like that
dear mother so well remembered.</p>

<p>After answering a good many
questions about her life in New York,
Mrs. Edgar, Jessie, and her lover,
Margaret said rather abruptly,</p>

<p>"You see a good deal of Doctor
James, don't you, aunt?"</p>

<p>"Oh! almost every day, my dear.
He has to drive very often over to
Sealing, and my house is right on his
way. He feels quite attached to me,
because, once when his sister was staying
with him, she was sick, and I used
to go and sit with her; and at last,
when she was getting well, and was
able to be moved, I got her to come
and make me a visit; for I thought it
must be dull for her, with her brother
away so much. So he used to come
every day to see about her, and he got
into the way of dropping in as if he
belonged here, and he has kept it up
ever since."</p>

<p>"What sort of a girl was the sister?"</p>

<p>"Oh! she was a charming creature&mdash;pretty
and picturesque; young,
too, and very clever for her age;
and the doctor thought every thing
of her, though he used to find fault
with her and try to improve her, and
was always bringing some hard book
for Lucy to read, or asking me to
tell her this, or remind her of that,
and not let her forget the other, till I
used to think the poor child would
have been vexed with both him and
me; but she used to laugh and shake
her pretty brown curls, and make the
best of it all. I grew to love that
child, Margaret, and I confess to you,
if you had not come to me, I would
very probably have offered to adopt
her, and do for her as if she were my
own. I did not suppose you needed
any money, my dear," she added in
an apologetic tone.</p>

<p>"Don't mention your money,
please," cried Margaret. "Dear
aunty, I can't manage what I've got
now; why should I want any more?
By all means make the pretty Lucy
an heiress, and let her come and live
here, near her brother."</p>

<p>Miss Spelman shook her head, and
Margaret continued,</p>

<p>"But where does Lucy live, and
where does the family come from originally?"</p>

<p>"They have had a country-seat in
Maine for years, and are very nice
people, I would think; the doctor,
at least, is a perfect gentleman. He
has been in the war, was wounded
two or three times; and when it was
all over, came here because the old
doctor was about to move away.
They knew each other, and so Dr.
James just quietly took the other's
place, and has a great deal more than
filled it ever since."</p>

<p>"But why does he choose to live
in a little place like this? Jessie told
me something of his benevolence; but
that doesn't seem reason enough to
keep him here."</p>

<p>"That is the only reason, I am
sure&mdash;that, and attachment to the
place and people. He does an immense
amount of good, my dear;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
why, he attends all the poor people,
for miles around, for nothing!"</p>

<p>"But then what does he live on?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not on his fees. He
has a little money of his own&mdash;enough
for such a place as this&mdash;and that
leaves him free, as he says, to have
no hard money feelings between him
and his patients. The consequence
is, he is worshipped by the poor, and,
in fact, by almost every one both
here and at Sealing; they give him
no peace, and he has to work like a
horse all the time."</p>

<p>"I hope he enjoys it."</p>

<p>"He says he does; but I think
the life is too hard for him."</p>

<p>"And does he intend to live here
indefinitely?"</p>

<p>"He never alludes to living anywhere
else; but I hope he may marry
some day, and then, no doubt, he
would go where his wife wished."</p>

<p>"Don't you think his wishes
ought to be hers?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, my dear Margaret, I
think so; but then, I believe I'm old-fashioned."
Miss Spelman was pleased,
that was evident; and then she
said she knew her niece was a fine
musician, but she was perhaps "too
tired to touch the instrument?"</p>

<p>Margaret smiled, and though she
was tired certainly, and sleepy besides,
she went with a very good
grace to "the instrument," which she
found to be an old piano, excellent
in its day, but now out of tune and
jingling; the keys were yellow, and
one pedal was broken, but no speck
of dust was to be seen inside or out,
or on any thing else in Miss Selina's
house. Margaret, without thinking
much about it, played some very modern
music, such as she generally
played in the evenings at Mrs. Edgar's,
deep and difficult music, playing
well and carefully, without notes;
till she began to realize how impossible
any execution would be on such
a piano. When she paused, Miss
Spelman said rather plaintively,</p>

<p>"That is very fine, my dear; but
my taste is not up to the present
standard. And&mdash;do you play from
note, dear Margaret?"</p>

<p>On receiving an affirmative reply,
she went into an adjoining closet,
and brought out one or two old music-books,
marked on the covers,
"M. and S. Spelman," and with Margaret
and Selina alternately written
on the music within. Margaret had
never seen such a collection of curious,
old, simple music. She smiled
as she played, to see her aunt's hands
beating time, and watched the absorbed
expression of her face, varying
from a smile of content to a look of
sadness and regret. As she at last
closed the piano, she said,</p>

<p>"I will play these pieces over
when I am by myself, and then I
shall do them more justice when I
play them for you again. Forgive my
many blunders."</p>

<p>Then came cake, fruit, and wine,
at nine o'clock, and then Margaret
was glad to say "good-night" and
go to her pleasant room, where she
found, to her great satisfaction, that
she was soothed to sleep by the
breaking of the waves on Shellbeach.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br />
A CONFIDENTIAL LETTER.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dearest Jessie</span>: I have received
your most welcome letter,
and only wish I could tell you how
good it was to hear from you. It
made me long to see you, dear;
but as I am resolved I will not
be so weak as to give up and
go back to you yet, I will not sentimentalize
now, nor dwell on my
feelings, which, I assure you, are unusually
tender for me.</p>

<p>I have now been here three whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
days, and they seem as many months;
the snow-storm which began the
night after my arrival, lasted perseveringly
till this morning, when there
was a beautiful clear-away, and my
spirits, which were rather drooping,
rose at once. It was very cold, and
Aunt Selina was afraid to go out, and
I was lazy, and passed the morning in
the house. After dinner, however, I
became desperate, put on my shortest
dress and rubber boots, and went
forth with Jimmy on an exploring
expedition. The snow was very
deep; but I needed exercise, and enjoyed
immensely plunging about in
the fresh drifts, and getting rid, at the
same time, if I must confess it, of a
fair amount of wrath and resentment,
of which your paragon of a doctor
was the cause. Only think, my dear,
of his allowing me to be three days
here without calling! In such weather,
too, when he must have known I was
penned up in the house with nothing
to amuse me, (not that I didn't
amuse myself very well, but he could
not have known that.) How did he
know that I mightn't have caught a
severe cold in that horrid waiting-room
at the station, or driving with him in his
freezing chaise? And after leaving
me in that abrupt way, waiting on
the steps here, without a single polite
word to me or Aunt Selina, as if he
said, "I have been dreadfully bored
by having to bring you here; now let
me get away as fast as I can!" Well,
I was provoked with him, and with
myself for caring; but I grew pleasanter
every step I took; and when I
at last found myself on a high bank
right over the sea, and the pretty little
beach with the dear, blue waves breaking
and foaming below me, I was in a
state of exhilaration and delight that
I can't describe. I could hardly have
torn myself away, except that I was
very cold; and the sunset light had almost
faded when I got home. Then,
my dear, what do you think? Aunt
Selina greeted me with, "O Margaret!
what a pity you went out; here
Doctor James has been waiting nearly
an hour for you, and he wanted so
much to see you, and was so sorry
that he couldn't come before! But,
my dear, he has been away, and only
got home this morning." That was
funny, was it not? "He looked so
nice," Aunt Selina said. "I wish you
could once see him nicely dressed;
he doesn't take enough pains with
himself generally." Now, I know
that aunty was as much surprised as
I that this call had not been made
before, and a great deal more disturbed.
She praises the doctor on
every occasion, and I am sure she
wanted him to make a favorable impression
on me. She has been very
curious about our drive from the station;
but I have said very little about
it, except that I thought we were all
of us cold and cross.</p>

<p>Well, I was nicely wet from my
snowy walk; but after I had changed
my dress and had my tea, I felt
splendidly. At eight o'clock the bell
rang&mdash;a wonderful circumstance, so
far&mdash;and after a little delay in the hall,
in walked the doctor. I suppose he
could not bear that his get-up should
be thrown away, and he really looked
very nice indeed. I am sure he
prides himself on his feet and hands,
which are small&mdash;not in themselves,
but for his size&mdash;and well shaped.
His clothes were any thing but fashionable;
but they fitted him well, and
looked as if he were at home in them,
and something in his general appearance
made me feel that he had intended
to do me honor, and I was
quite mollified toward him. Aunt
Selina was enraptured. I was&mdash;can
you imagine it?&mdash;a little embarrassed,
having been wholly taken by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
surprise at his making his appearance;
he was calm and at his ease.
He explained his apparent neglect of
me, expressed regret at finding me
out this afternoon, and asked about
my walk, etc. He is provoking in
many ways, Jessie, but in one especially:
he is so stingy of his smiles; I
can express it in no other way. He
is the most serious person I ever saw;
even when it would be polite to
smile, he will not; but moves the
muscles round his mouth in a peculiar
way that makes me want to say
to him, "Well, why don't you do it?
It won't hurt you!" His eyes are
not particularly large, but gray, and
look as if they saw as much as mine,
only he does not stare as I do, but
seems to take in every thing with one
glance. I did not find him difficult
to talk to, as I imagined I should,
but am surprised to find how much
he knows. He asked me to play,
but did not like the piece; and when
I tried him with a little of Aunt Selina's
music&mdash;which I described to you
in my first letter, you remember&mdash;he
asked for Beethoven. That he enjoyed,
I believe, and a few of my little
French airs, one of which he recognized,
and I discovered, to my astonishment,
that he had been abroad.
He spoke of organ music, and when
I told him about my desire to learn
to play on the organ, said he thought
I could do so here, as there were
both a good organ and organist at
Sealing. And, if he arranges it so, I
am to take lessons once or twice a
week, and practise in the little church
here. Well, dear Jessie, this letter
must come to a close, as I am sleepy.
Give my best love to your dear mother;
write soon and tell me all about
your own affairs and Philip.</p>

<p>
Always your loving</p>

</p>


<h3>CHAPTER V.<br />
A SLEIGH-RIDE.</h3>

<p>On the morning after Margaret
had written the letter to her friend,
given above, she was finishing her
breakfast at about nine o'clock, while
little Miss Spelman bustled about in
her china-closet, and around the
room, when a jingle of bells was
heard, and in a moment more, Dr.
James appeared at the dining-room
door.</p>

<p>"Miss Lester, do you feel in the
mood for a sleigh-ride? I have to
go over to Sealing, and shall be glad
to take you."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes," cried Margaret, jumping
up from the table, "of all things
what I would like best; but I must
change my dress, I am afraid. I will
not be ten minutes, if you can wait."</p>

<p>"I have a call to make near here,
and will come back for you."</p>

<p>In a short time Margaret appeared,
dressed in a dark blue suit
with black dog-skin furs, and a very
jaunty round cap to match on her
head.</p>

<p>"Will you be warm enough?"
asked the doctor, surveying her.</p>

<p>"I have my cloak besides," said
Margaret, displaying a very thick
and heavy mantle, of every color of
the rainbow.</p>

<p>As they drove off, Doctor James
remarked,</p>

<p>"You will set this quiet little place
on fire, with your bright colors; we
don't see such brilliant things here
very often."</p>

<p>"Gay colors are the fashion," said
Margaret, "and I almost always
wear them. I get very tired of them,
however, and wish my style were not
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">prononcé</i>. I quite long sometimes to
wear neutral tints, and cool, delicate
colors."</p>

<p>"Miss Edgar wears such shades,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
does she not? She is so perfectly refined
and lady-like."</p>

<p>Margaret glanced at him quickly
and answered,</p>

<p>"She does, when she is willing to
take the trouble; but I generally have
to insist upon her dressing becomingly.
When we were in Paris, we were
both told about our different styles,
and how we should dress; and I
think it is worth while to consider
the subject, and Jessie does not; that
is all."</p>

<p>"Does not Miss Edgar care for
dress?"</p>

<p>"I think she does; but for dress
without any reference to herself.
She is very fond of pretty things, and
would be quite contented to wear a
rose-colored bonnet, or a bird-of-paradise
evening dress, if I did not
prevent it. You admire Miss Edgar
very much, do you not, Dr. James?"</p>

<p>"As much as I can admire a lady
I have never seen. But why should
you think that I admire her?"</p>

<p>"And if she were not already engaged,
you would like to marry her
yourself, would you not?"</p>

<p>Margaret spoke impulsively; and
before she had uttered the last words
would gladly have swallowed the sentence
whole, but it was too late. The
doctor's face flushed, and he said
very slowly,</p>

<p>"Did Miss Edgar show you that
letter?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I mean no; that is, I mean,
Dr. James, that I took it away from
her and read it myself. She did not
want me to see it; it was all my
fault. Jessie is gentle, and I am
rough, and I tyrannize over her very
often."</p>

<p>Margaret's voice sounded remorseful,
and the doctor softened.</p>

<p>"There was no reason why you
should not have seen that letter, any
more than any other. I would not
have Miss Edgar other than Philip's
wife for any thing in the world; and
my saying I would have liked her
myself, was meant only as a joke,
and I am sure she understood it so.
Indeed, I was far from being in earnest
when I wrote that letter."</p>

<p>It was now Margaret's turn to
change color, and her face burned;
an unusual and painful thing for her.
She felt at that moment as if she
would like to find herself on the opposite
side of the world. What an
absurd position she was in! This man
must regard her as a fool, or worse.
What business had she to be at Shellbeach
at all, or here in this sleigh,
beside one on whom she had not
the smallest claim, and who had no
reason to think her any thing but a
forward, unlady-like girl, as she was?
These, and many equally disagreeable
thoughts rushed through her
mind, before Dr. James said pleasantly,</p>

<p>"Is it possible you keep up your
city hours here, and breakfast at nine
o'clock? How luxurious your life
must be!"</p>

<p>"Does nine seem late to you?"
asked Margaret, making an effort to
speak carelessly; "it is early to me.
When we used to come home from
parties at three or four in the morning,
we breakfasted at eleven or even
twelve. But there is no excuse for
sleeping late here, I know; I might
go to bed at eight o'clock in the evening,
except when we have a visitor,
as we did last night. But you see
there are no bells; my room is dark,
and Cécile never comes in till I ring
for her. Then, Aunt Selina says she
does not mind."</p>

<p>"Miss Spelman is not a very early
riser herself. But, Miss Lester, I
think a poor man's household ought
to be up with the dawn." He smiled
at her in a friendly way as he
spoke, and Margaret laughed.</p>

<p>"And the mistress of a poor man's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
household ought to call all the members
of the family, ought she not?"</p>

<p>"I think so; that is a very important
matter. Yet I know few things
in our daily life which require more
heroism than getting up in the morning
at the right time. Though I
ought to be accustomed to being
called at any and every hour, I never
find it grows easy to forsake my
pillow; and whenever it is not imperatively
necessary for me to get up,
I prolong my morning nap in the
most cowardly way."</p>

<p>"Were you in earnest when you
said getting up early was heroism?"</p>

<p>"It is a grand name for a small
matter, certainly; but I was in earnest
when I said it."</p>

<p>"I should so like to be a heroine!
It is almost worth while to try the experiment."</p>

<p>They now drove into the main
street of the town of Sealing, and
there Dr. James showed Margaret a
bookstore, the circulating library,
and pointed out one or two more
shops, and asked her if she thought
she could occupy herself for half an
hour, while he visited a few patients.</p>

<p>"I may be gone even longer than
that," he said, "and it would be
very cold for you to sit in the sleigh
and wait."</p>

<p>"I should like to explore the town
very well," she answered; "and I will
meet you in an hour's time wherever
you say. O Dr. James! I want a
sled very much; I delight in coasting.
Could I get a good one here?"</p>

<p>"There are no toy-shops, properly
speaking, but there is an excellent
carpenter across the street, and he
would make you a satisfactory sled,
I have no doubt."</p>

<p>"There is coasting about here, I
hope?"</p>

<p>"Yes, there are one or two capital
hills. If you like, we will go to the
carpenter's now, before I leave you;
perhaps my advice on the subject
would be acceptable."</p>

<p>They ordered the sled, and Margaret
added, with a sideway glance at
Dr. James, that the word "Enterprise"
was to be printed in red letters
on one side, and "1867" on the
other. The apothecary's shop was
appointed as the place of rendezvous,
and the doctor drove away.</p>

<p>He was back again first; but after
waiting and wondering a few minutes,
she came round the corner,
looking at her watch, with a bright
color, and her dress white with snow.</p>

<p>"I am on time," she cried; "just
an hour, Dr. James; and I have had
such a splendid time! But I have a few
things at the different shops; will
you stop for them?"</p>

<p>From a small shop, combining the
establishments of a small watch-maker,
a locksmith, and a bell-hanger,
a man came out with a parcel which
Margaret insisted on holding in her
own hands all the way home.</p>

<p>"What do you think it is?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"I can't imagine what you should
want from that shop, but the shape is
very much like a clock."</p>

<p>"You are right; it is an alarm-clock."</p>

<p>Dr. James smiled, but made no
comment; and as they drove home,
she gave him an account of the hour
she had spent alone.</p>

<p>"I got one or two books from the
library; pretty trashy, I should think,
but it was entertaining to read the
names of the well-worn volumes on
the shelves. I visited the dry-goods
store, and then determined to explore;
and pretty soon I found a little street
which was one steep hill, down which
some small boys were coasting. They
seemed harmless and meek, and after
bestowing upon them a paper of
sugar-plums I had just bought, I requested
the loan of a sled. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
should have seen the astonishment
depicted on their faces, and heard
the giggles and rapture when, taking
the largest sled from the unresisting
hand of its owner, I asked for instruction
as to establishing myself upon it
and starting, and then went full
speed down the hill, regardless of the
houses on either side and the shouts
of my friends above me. It was
splendid, Dr. James! I don't know
when I have enjoyed any thing so
much! Well, I dragged my sled up
again, and asked for six more coasts,
hinting at more candy to be forthcoming;
but I found all offers of
compensation quite unnecessary, as
the little fellows were as enraptured
as I at the performance, and each
begged me pathetically to try his
sled. But I held to my first choice;
and though on the third coast I upset
and rolled in the snow, I persevered
till I found my hour was almost up,
and then abandoned my sled to its
owner."</p>

<p>Dr. James seemed much entertained
by this description, and Margaret
added,</p>

<p>"But for the credit of human nature,
and especially of boy nature,
which I have always considered to
be remorseless to the last degree, I
must tell you that when I fell off my
sled into the snow the boys did not
laugh at and deride me, but came
running down the hill to see if I were
hurt&mdash;a circumstance which pleased
me very much."</p>

<p>The drive back to Shellbeach seemed
all too short for Margaret; she
was left, as before, on the doorstep
with her several bundles; but this
time she entered as a member of the
family, glowing with the exercise and
almost as noisy as Jimmy, who came
barking and leaping to welcome his
mistress. She gave a detailed account
of her drive to her aunt, ending
with the exclamation, "And Dr.
James both smiled and laughed! I
feel that I have achieved a triumph!"</p>


<h3>CHAPTER VI.<br />
ANOTHER LETTER.</h3>

<p>The following is a letter which Dr.
James wrote to his friend Philip:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You ask me to tell you about Jessie's
friend, who has come to stay with my old
crony, Miss Spelman, and I see that you are
curious to know my sentiments regarding
her. I also suspect, from the tone of your
remarks, that you think it would be a very
good thing for a poor doctor like me, etc.,
etc. That this coincides with Miss Selina's
course of reasoning on this matter, I am
pretty certain; for before Miss Lester came
she was continually praising her to me, and
now I can see that every opportunity is
improved to bring us together. Would you
believe it, Philip?&mdash;when the young lady arrived,
Miss Spelman man&oelig;uvred so as to
give me a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> drive with her from the
station to the house! She was disappointed
in her plans, as there were both a maid
and a dog to be packed into my chaise besides
Miss Lester. But what seems so
plain to other people's eyes, I cannot say
is so to mine. You want a description of
her, and add a hope that I have found the
ideal of our college days. I laugh as I recall
that ideal, and think of the reality before
my mind's eye. Picture to yourself,
then, a tall young woman&mdash;five feet eight
inches, I should say&mdash;large in proportion,
and a decided brunette. She is called handsome,
as you know, but I do not agree to
this; though if the adjective were <em>showy</em>,
I should have no objection to make. Her
style is rather loud, or, as she herself says,
'<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">prononcé</i>.' She has a pair of very brown,
inquisitive eyes, which see, I am sure,
much more than they have any right to see.
She has a good deal of color, but not the
changing blush we used to talk of. Her
dress? Of course I cannot give you a correct
description of that; but the first time I
saw her in the house, she wore very deep
purple with ornaments of gold, a gold band
on her hair, and long, barbarous eardrops.
The next time, in the morning, she was
dressed (I am not joking) in bright scarlet,
worked all over with black; and she went
to drive with me in a round fur cap that
would have been appropriate to a young
swell in New York, but hardly to a lady.
But all these objections are, after all, minor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
when I come to the great one; my dear fellow,
she is an heiress! Now, you know
very well my mind on this subject; and I
know you will think of my favorite verse,</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Where I want of riches find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Think what with them I would do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That without them dare to woo.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"But in this case I feel sure that I should
not be a disinterested lover. I could never
forget her money. By the way, I suspect
that she did not intend me to know she was
wealthy; Jessie's note gave the impression
that she had, as I wished, enough to secure
her own comfort; but Miss Spelman took
care to let me understand how very well her
niece was provided with 'earthly goods.'</p>

<p>"I see I am allowing myself to find fault
with Miss Lester and criticise her, a thing
I have resolved I will not do. I will therefore
suppress a good deal more of disapproval
I was going to write, and see what I
can tell you in her praise. In the first
place, I think she is good-tempered; I have
seen her thoughtful of her maid, and good-natured
when she was both cold and hungry.
She is entertaining, intelligent, and
companionable. I enjoyed her society when
I drove her over to Sealing, and she is
wonderfully fresh and simple in her tastes
for a <i>blase</i> New Yorker, surfeited with
gayeties as she has been. She is a good
musician, though she does not sing. Her
hands are her best feature: large and shapely
and well kept; they are also warm,
smooth, and womanly.</p>

<p>"Where is my dream, Philip? Would not
your gentle Jessie more nearly fulfil it?
You will say that dreams 'go by contraries;'
true perhaps of those we frame at night, unconsciously;
but does that wise maxim hold
good of day-dreams and castles in the air
also? Now, you have chosen well and wisely
for yourself, and my best wish is that you
and your loving helpmate may live to enjoy
all the bliss you hope for; but I must wait
until my wife manifests herself, as I am
sure she will, unmistakably, and for that I
am content to wait until I am an old man."</p></blockquote>

<p>It will be seen from this letter
that Dr. James had not disclosed,
even to his old friend, the secret of
Margaret's visit to Shellbeach; neither
was Jessie more communicative
on the subject; for they were both
rather ashamed of the affair. Margaret
herself, to tell the truth, was not
free from a like embarrassment; there
was something manly and unassuming
about the doctor, a freedom from
all pretension and assertion, that
made her feel, when with him, quiet
and almost diffident. This, however,
she did not acknowledge to herself;
and her high spirits determined her
to carry out her plan, and brave all
the obstacles which her appreciation
of the circumstances suggested to her.
From one point of view, her coming
was a success; Miss Spelman was
charmed with her, and spoke of her
remaining indefinitely. She made
much of and petted her in a way
Margaret was not accustomed to, and
which was very pleasant to her. She
could almost imagine, now, what it
would be to have a mother's love
and care during these years of
her youthful womanhood. True, her
aunt was no support, and her advice
was not always wise; but Margaret
was both by nature and habit self-reliant,
and the person was not come,
she thought, to whom she could
abandon the reins of government, and
in whose favor she might abdicate.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER VII.<br />
FROM THE LABORING CLASSES.</h3>

<p>After a week had passed in her
aunt's well-ordered household, Margaret
received a few ceremonious
calls from the ladies of Shellbeach
and Sealing, which, in the course of
another week, she returned with due
formality with her aunt. The visiting
acquaintance of Miss Spelman
at Shellbeach consisted of a few
elderly ladies, of whom Margaret saw
but little during her visit, though they
were kind and cordial, and always
gave her a pleasant welcome to their
houses.</p>

<p>There was one caller, however,
of whom Margaret was destined to
see a good deal, and who deserves a
more particular description. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
a lady who might have been between
forty and fifty, who came walking
into the house without ringing, one
windy evening, in rubber boots, with
which she had been making herself a
path in the newly fallen snow. She was
tall and thin, with heavy eye-brows,
and rather masculine bearing and
manners, but a very genial smile
beamed on her lips and in her eyes.
Her voice was loud but cheerful, and
she gave Margaret a warm squeeze
of the hand and a good, steady look
in the eye, that seemed to show she
was disposed for friendliness.</p>

<p>"Well now, Martha," said Miss
Spelman, helping her guest off with
hood and cloak, and wheeling up a
comfortable chair for her to the fire,
"where have you been all this long
time? And how are you and your
poor old father? How does the house
stand this cold winter, and how are
you getting along altogether?"</p>

<p>The visitor seated herself in the
chair, tucked up her plain brown
gown over her knees, and clasped
her rough, strong-looking hands,
seeming to enjoy the cheery blaze;
then she answered rather slowly,</p>

<p>"We are very well off, thank
you, Miss Spelman. Father's about
the same as usual; he misses the
garden now the snow has come.
The house is pretty tight, and I keep
the fires going with Norah's help.
You know Dr. James got Norah for
us, and a more willing, good-natured
creature I never wish to see. She
really seems to have brought sunshine
into the house, and says, 'May the
queen of heaven send you good
health, sir!' and, 'May the blessed
saints look out for you, Miss Martha!'
quite in the old-country fashion."</p>

<p>"I don't know about Irish help,"
said Miss Spelman; "I never can get
along with them. I haven't had one
these ten years, since my poor old
Bridget died; and then they're always
so set about getting to church,
and dreadfully put out if they are
prevented now and then."</p>

<p>"Do you think so? Well, Norah
says to me, 'I dearly love to go to
holy Mass, and to pay my respects
on the saints' days; but the priest
tells me to mind my duty in the
house first, and I wouldn't feel easy
to go and leave that poor lamb (one
of her names for my father) with
none to look after his dinner.'"</p>

<p>"Well, long may she prove a treasure,
that's all," and the old lady
shook her head doubtfully.</p>

<p>"You've come to a pretty place,
Miss Lester," said Martha Burney;
"it's pretty enough now, with its
fresh white dress of snow; but I don't
know what you'll say to it when the
young green comes out, and the
birds begin to sing. But what do
you find to do with yourself?"</p>

<p>"Nothing very useful yet. I have
given my attention principally to
coasting; I have got a new sled, and
have found some charming coasts
about here. I go out before breakfast."</p>

<p>"Bless me! how many ages is it,
I wonder, since I did that?" cried
Miss Burney. "Then you do not keep
late hours in the morning?"</p>

<p>"I did at first, through force of
habit; but now I have an alarm-clock,
and try getting up at six, and dressing
without a fire."</p>

<p>"Very well, very well indeed, for
a New Yorker! Ah! I see you will
do for the country. You must never
go away, but make up your mind to
settle down here."</p>

<p>"That's what I mean to have her
do," said Miss Spelman; "and Margaret
said she would consider the
subject."</p>

<p>Miss Burney's call lasted a full
hour; then she enveloped herself in
cloak and hood, and shaking Margaret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
once more warmly by the hand
took her departure.</p>

<p>"Who is she, aunt? I think she
must be a character, and mean to cultivate
her acquaintance."</p>

<p>"Yes, she has a story. Her father&mdash;lamb,
indeed!" cried Miss Spelman,
interrupting herself; "that
Norah had better call him 'poor
wolf;' to be sure he is reaping the
fruits of his misdeeds, but he has
richly deserved his troubles. Well,
he was a swindler; that is all. His
poor wife died of the shame when
the biggest of his robberies came to
light, and he went steadily down-hill,
with this brave daughter trying to
keep him straight. He spent one or
two poor little legacies she had left
her, and at last became the broken-down,
imbecile old man he is now.
When he was too feeble to prevent
her, Martha took him out of the
great city where he lived, and they
somehow found their way here; and
then she went to work and has supported
him ever since. She teaches
in the public school over in Sealing;
she is the head lady teacher now,
and with that, and a little she has
had left her within a few years, she
supports herself and him."</p>

<p>"Is it not a hard life for her?"</p>

<p>"Very, but she prefers obscurity;
and that is the best employment she
can get here. She is a fine woman,
independent and brave, owing no
one any thing and taking care of
herself. She had a lover once, they
say," continued Miss Selina, dropping
her voice; "but when it all came
to light about her father's transactions,
of course she released him."</p>

<p>"And he accepted it?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly he did, dear Margaret;
no man would wish to marry
a woman with such a father."</p>

<p>Margaret drummed with her foot
on the fender, but made no reply.</p>

<p>"I like Martha Burney's company,
and I try to make her come here
often; but it is hard to induce her to
leave her father. She says she has to
be away from him so much of each
day, that it is not right to let him
pass any more time alone."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose she would not
object to my going to see her."</p>

<p>"She would be delighted to see
you. She has all her evenings, and
Wednesday and Saturday afternoons.
She is very fond of young people."</p>

<p>The Sealing callers do not demand
a particular description. There were
a few young ladies, none of whom
Margaret much liked; she thought
them assuming and silly. One of them
crowned her other offences by replying
to a question of Margaret's about
Miss Burney, "Oh! yes, very estimable
person, I believe; I do not
know her. Were you aware that
she teaches in the public school?"</p>

<h2>THE IMMUTABILITY OF THE SPECIES.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a><br />

I.</h2>

<p>For a century and a half, the attention
of the scientific world has
been repeatedly called to theories
purporting to prove the evolution of
the species. Before the last dozen
years, they elicited nothing but deserved
contempt from those conversant
with the phenomena of which
they treat. Their absurdity was
transparent, alike in their conclusion
and in the processes by which that
conclusion was held to have been
reached. They were in succession
fully refuted. But there arose a class
of men, somewhat superior in intellect
and ingenuity to the propounders
of these speculations, who were
imbued with similar atheistic principles.
They directed all their efforts
toward the conception of a theory
more capable than the others of attaining
a respectable scientific <i>status</i>.
It would have been matter of great
surprise, then, if this concentration
of intellectual energy had not resulted
in something sufficiently plausible
to startle the world.</p>

<p>In the year 1859, Mr. Charles
Darwin, one of the first naturalists
of England, propounded his theory
of development, in a work termed
<i>The Origin of Species</i>. This purported
to be a full and conclusive confirmation
of the hypothesis of evolution.
The theory was elaborate and ingenious,
and on its appearance was immediately
advocated by many men
to whom it was not wholly unexpected.
Its congruity with their atheistic
views can alone furnish an adequate
explanation of the haste with
which they declared themselves its
advocates. This harmony with preconceived
ideas was confessedly the
chief inducement urging them to
accept the theory. Hear Mr. Herbert
Spencer's conception of the
spirit in which a person should approach
the subject: "Before it can
be ascertained how organized beings
have been gradually evolved, there
must be reached the conviction that
they <em>have</em> been gradually evolved."
The italics are his own. Mr. George
Henry Lewes, in an article in the
<cite>Fortnightly Review</cite> for April 1st,
1868, says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There can be little doubt that the acceptance
or rejection of Darwinism has, in
the vast majority of cases, been wholly determined
by the monistic or dualistic attitude
of the mind. And this explains, what
would otherwise be inexplicable, the surprising
fervor and facility with which men,
wholly incompetent to appreciate the evidence
for or against natural selection, have
adopted or 'refuted' it."</p></blockquote>

<p>That Mr. Lewes and other really
able men have been so influenced,
we entertain not the slightest doubt.
But their failure to discover and appreciate
the evidence against the
theory, we ascribe not to incompetency,
but to the bias of a foregone
conclusion. We hail with delight
the efforts of these men to sustain
the theory, confident that, the greater
the light thrown upon it, the more
glaringly palpable will become its absurdity.</p>

<p>We purpose to show, in this and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
other articles, that the facts which
are seemingly so congruous with the
conception of evolution are in reality
grossly at variance with it, and strictly
in accordance with the doctrine
of special creations. We will proceed
at once to their consideration.</p>

<p>Variations form the data of Darwin's
theory. These, as facts, cannot
be disputed. Variation is everywhere
seen. Scarcely any species, either
animal or vegetable, has escaped this
tendency. While some species have
not presented differences among their
individuals sufficiently marked for
the formation of varieties, a multitude
of other species display modifications
which form the characteristics of
dozens of widely distinct breeds.
Not less than one hundred and fifty
distinct strains and varieties have descended
from the original wild pigeon,
<i>columba livia</i>. All these varieties
result from man's careful selection,
and his judicious pairing of
those individuals which possess the
required modifications. This he does
in sure reliance on the law of heredity,
which transmits to the offspring
the most minute peculiarities of the
parents, saving, of course, when they
are brought into conflict with opposite
characters. These variations are
both in the direction of increase and
in the direction of decrease. Here
we find a variety formed by the appearance
of a modification not observable
in the species under nature,
and there a variety formed by the
total or partial suppression of one
or more characters. Now, few portions
of the organization are incapable
of modification. Darwin has
conclusively shown that even the
bones and internal organs have been
greatly modified. To realize fully
the extent and scope of variation, it
is necessary to consult Darwin's late
work, <i>Animals and Plants under Domestication</i>.
Many of the modifications&mdash;especially
those most widely
divergent&mdash;constitute differences
greater than those which distinguish
species from species, and, in some
few cases, genus from genus.</p>

<p>It may here be thought that we
have made too great concessions;
that the logical and inevitable conclusion
from the facts, as we state
them, is the evolution of the species.
Not so. For the more numerous
and the more widely divergent the
modifications are shown to be, the
more easily will we be able to prove
to demonstration the fixity of the
species.</p>

<p>As these varieties (or incipient species,
as Darwin conceives them to
be) were formed through the selection
by man of slight successive modifications,
Darwin affects to believe
that variations arose in the wild state;
that they were accumulated and preserved
by nature by a process analogous
to man's selection; and that by
the long continued accumulation and
conservation, through countless ages,
of these modifications, the species
have evolved from one another.
This selective power of nature he infers
from the struggle for existence
constantly carried on in the wild state,
wherein the weak succumb, and the
fittest, strongest, and most vigorous
survive, and, according to the theory,
attain to a higher development.</p>

<p>Many objections have been urged
against Darwin's theory. Some have
questioned the efficiency of natural
selection; and others have contended
that selection necessarily implies
a selecter. Some have considered
Darwinism sufficiently disproved by
the absence of the transitional links
between the different species. Others
have asserted the inconceivableness
of the primordial differentiation of
parts in organisms when they all presented
the simplest structure. Another
argument has been adduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
from the tendency of domesticated
animals and plants, when neglected,
to recur to the ancestral form under
nature. Some assume a limit to variation;
while others have contended
that domestication of itself has introduced
something plastic into organisms,
enabling them to vary, and that,
therefore, the analogy drawn between
animals and plants under domestication
and those under nature is inadmissible.
Others assert that domestic
animals and plants have been rendered
in an especial manner subservient
to the uses and purposes of
man. In conformity with this view,
they also affirm that the conception
of species is, for that reason, not
applicable to the creatures under domestication.
For ourselves, we concede
that the analogy between domesticated
and natural animals and
plants is a just one, in the light in
which the phenomena of variation
are generally regarded. For we
wholly dissent from the opinion of
the introduction by domestication of
any thing plastic into organisms, and
firmly believe in the operation of
secondary causes in the formation of
varieties.</p>

<p>These arguments, in the form in
which they are adduced, are inconclusive.
Their weakness springs from
an error into which those who have
urged them have fallen, which vitiates
at the start all their reasoning. To
this error we shall presently advert.
But while we cannot concur in their
premises, we have something more
than an intuition of the truth of their
common conclusion.</p>

<p>The facts, of which the <i>Animals
and Plants under Domestication</i> is a
vast repertory, admit of a theory
more conformable than that of Darwin
to the phenomena of variation;
a theory which fully accounts for the
appearance of the profitable modifications
under domestication, (confessedly
inexplicable on Darwin's theory,)
and for the formation of races
under nature; a theory admitting of
still further variation; and which is
at the same time strictly in accordance
with the doctrines of special
creations and of the immutability of
the species. This teleological explanation,
of which we conceive the
phenomena of variation to be susceptible,
we will render amenable to all
the canons of scientific research.
And in doing so, we will rely for our
proofs upon no evidence but that
furnished us by noted evolutionists.</p>

<p>The seeming concurrence of all
the evidence in favor of Darwinism
results from a misconception by all
of the true nature of its data. In
all the arguments adduced by the
advocates of special creation in disproof
of Darwin's hypotheses, these
variations have been tacitly admitted
to arise by evolution. That they
have thus arisen seems to be taken
for granted. In this admission lies
their error. Upon this current conception
of varietal evolution rests
the whole evolution hypothesis.
Upon the validity of this assumption
we join issue with Darwin,
as we conceive that upon this point
the whole question hinges. For
it is not a little illogical to concede
the evolution of varieties, and
to deny the evolution of species. If
we can show that this assumption is
invalid, the whole evolution fabric
will fall.</p>

<p>Darwin tacitly assumes that the
existing state of nature is the normal
or primordial condition of animals
and plants. The difficulty hitherto
experienced in confuting his errors
springs from acquiescence in this assumption.
True it is that Darwin
does not believe in the validity of
this assumption, but merely makes it
to show the inconceivableness of the
negation of evolution. With him a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
species is not fixed but fluctuating,
and is merely a subjective conception,
having no objective reality. Believing
in the converse assumption,
we advance the following theory:
<i>That animals and plants have degenerated
under nature, and that the favorable
modifications arising under domestication
are due to reversion to the
perfect type</i>.</p>

<p>Darwin, in treating of variations,
refers them indiscriminately to reversion
and to evolution. This he does
according to no law, rule, method,
or formula. The mere circumstance
that he has one subject under consideration,
suffices to induce him to
ascribe to reversion a modification
which, in another portion of his work,
he, with strange inconsistency, attributes
to "spontaneous variability."
He affects to deem it a sufficient answer
to the ascription of characters
to reversion, to appeal to the absence
of such characters in the species
under nature. If the assumption of
degeneration and subsequent favorable
reversion can lay even the least
claim to tenability, this answer is in
no wise satisfactory. If it can be
conclusively shown that most, if not
all, creatures in a state of nature, are
in a degenerated condition, then the
irresistible inference will be, in the
absence of any other rational explanation,
that favorable variations are
ascribable to reversion.</p>

<p>While, as Herbert Spencer says,
"a comparison of ancient and modern
members of the types which
have existed from paleozoic and mesozoic
times down to the present day
shows that the total amount of change
(in animals) is not relatively great,
and that it is not manifestly toward
a higher organization," paleontology
furnishes us with many facts showing
the great size of ancient mammals,
and marked degeneracy in their
descendants. Thus, Darwin concurs
with Bell, Cuvier, Nilsson, and others
in the belief that European cattle&mdash;the
Continental and Pembroke breeds,
and the Chillingham cattle&mdash;are the
degenerate descendants of the great
urus, (<i>bos primigenius</i>,) with which
they cannot now sustain a comparison,
so greatly have they degenerated.
Cæsar describes the urus as
being not much inferior in size to the
elephant. An entire skull of one,
found in Perthshire, measures one
yard in length, while the span of the
horn cores is three feet and six inches,
the breadth of the forehead between
the horns is ten and a half
inches, and from the middle of the
occipital ridge to the back of the
orbit it is thirteen inches, (<i>Owen's
British Fossil Mammals</i>, pp. 500, 501,
502.) The common red deer have
so greatly undergone degeneration
that the fossil remains of their progenitors
have been held to be those
of a distinct species, (<i>strongylocerus
spelæus</i>.) An advocate of Darwinism&mdash;a
writer in the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>
for October, 1868&mdash;differs with
Owen on this point, and holds that
the common red deer are their descendants,
greatly degenerated. From
their antlers it is inferred that they
equalled in height the megaceros,
whose height to summit of antlers
was ten feet four inches, (<i>Owen's
British Foss. Mam.</i>) So marked is
the difference in the size of the antlers,
says the Edinburgh reviewer, that it
would be possible to ascertain approximately
the antiquity of a deposit
in which they might be found
from that fact alone. The horse
and the <i>elephas antiquus</i> have also
been shown to have decreased in
size.</p>

<p>Changes similar to these have been
adduced by the advocates of evolution,
to show the manner in which
species have been formed under nature.
But these, we apprehend, imply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
devolution rather than evolution.
They also serve, contend they, as
illustrations of the harmony subsisting
between the organism and its
environment. If by this is meant
that the organism responds to every
marked change in the environment,
we admit the harmony. But if congruity
between a perfect physiological
state and the changed conditions is
implied, we demur. Certain conditions
are absolutely essential to the
growth of characters and to general
perfection. When they are so modified
as to entail the diminution or
loss of any positive feature, this tells
upon the organism. Darwin, noting
that the appearance of certain characters
was invariably consequent
upon the presence of certain conditions,
says (in order to avoid any
thing like a teleological implication)
that we must not thence infer that
those or any conditions are absolutely
necessary to the growth of
any organs or characters. That Darwin
errs, and that full physiological perfection
cannot exist except where there
is full general growth, and full growth
of all parts or organs, we shall clearly
demonstrate when, in a future article,
we treat of the laws of compensation
or balancement of growth, of
correlation, of crossing, and of close
interbreeding. But whether there
exists harmony between the organism
or not, there is none the less deterioration.
And when reversion to
the type from which the organism
has degenerated takes place under
domestication, it is termed evolution.</p>

<p>But those proofs of degeneration
and subsequent favorable reversion
upon which we chiefly rely are those
afforded by Darwin himself. On
page 8, Vol. I. of his late work, he
says, "Members of a high group
might even become, and this apparently
has occurred, fitted for simpler
conditions of life; and in this case,
natural selection would tend to simplify
or degrade the organism; for
complicated mechanism for simple
actions would be useless or even disadvantageous."
The efficiency of
natural selection in this respect we
fully concede.</p>

<p>And again, on page 12, "During
the many changes to which, in the
course of time, all organic beings
have been subjected, certain organs
or parts have occasionally become of
little use, and ultimately superfluous,
and the retention of such parts in a
rudimentary and utterly useless condition
can, on the descent theory, be
simply understood." We heartily
concur in this explanation furnished
by the descent theory, as we fully believe
all that is attributed to the law
of hereditary transmission, the particularities
of the hypothesis of pangenesis
excepted.</p>

<p>Treating of a symmetrical growth,
he cites the cases of "wrong fishes,"
gasteropods or shell-fish, of certain
species of bulimus, and many achitinellæ,
verucca, and orchids, and infers,
from their being as liable to be
unequally developed on the one as
on the other side, that the capacity
for development is present, and that
it is due to reversion. "And as a
reversal of development occasionally
occurs in animals of many kinds, this
latent capacity is probably very common."
(P. 53, vol. ii.)</p>

<p>On pages 58, 59, and 60 are given
cases of "the re-development of
wholly or partially aborted organs."
The <i>corydalis tuberosa</i> properly has
one of its two nectaries colorless, destitute
of nectar, and only one half
the size of the other. Its pistil is
curved toward the perfect nectary,
and the hood, formed of the inner
petals, slips off the pistil and stamens
in one direction alone, so that when
a bee sucks the perfect nectary, the
stigma and stamens are exposed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
rubbed against the insect's body.
"Now," says Darwin, "I have examined
several flowers of the <i>corydalis
tuberosa</i>, in which both nectaries
were equally developed, and contained
nectar; in this we see only the
re-development of a partially aborted
organ; but with this re-development
the pistil becomes straight and the
hood slips off in either direction; so
that the flowers have acquired the
perfect structure, so well adapted
for insect agency, of dielytra and its
allies. We cannot attribute these coadapted
modifications to chance, or
to correlated variability; we must attribute
them to reversion to a primordial
condition of the species." Upon
Darwin's hypothesis, all the beautiful,
delicate, involved, and harmonious
adjustments, coadaptations, relations,
and dependencies in organic nature
must, at some time, have arisen by
evolution. But here he apparently
assigns their coadaptation as a reason
for not ascribing these modifications
to chance, or to correlated variability;
as if their evolution were inconceivable.
Does this consist with
his theory? What difficulty exists
against their evolution now, which is
not susceptible of being urged with
equal if not greater force against
their evolution ages ago? Why push
the question further back in time?
Was the evolution of these modifications
less inconceivable then than
now? If so, why? In default of
an answer, we have no alternative but
to conclude that all favorable modifications
arise by reversion.</p>

<p>Having given several cases of the
"reappearance of organs of which
<i>not a vestige could be detected</i>," he declares
it "difficult to believe that they
would have come to full perfection
in color, structure, and function unless
those organs had, at some former
period, passed through a similar
course of growth." We surmise that
at the moment in which Darwin conceived
such a difficulty, his singularly
powerful imagination was impaired
by over-exercise. We trust that, on
the recurrence of such a mental state,
he will cease to marvel at us for experiencing
a like difficulty in conceiving
the evolution of any favorable
characters.</p>

<p>After giving the opinion of several
naturalists&mdash;in which he concurs&mdash;"that
the common bond of connection
between the several foregoing
cases is an actual though partial <em>return</em>
to the ancient progenitor of the
group," he says, "If this view be correct,
we must believe that a vast
number of characters capable of evolution
(!) lie hidden in every organic
being." Here Darwin, as if he had
demonstrated the tendency to revert
too clearly for the tenableness of his
theory, asserts that the appearance
of these characters, which have been
by him attributed to reversion, is attributable
to evolution. The inconsistency
is manifest. But this may be
taken as a type of the whole of Darwinism.
For the author, after acquainting
us, without the slightest
apparent hesitation, with facts showing
degeneration to have been little
short of universal, declares that he
is forced to believe that favorable
modifications are due to "spontaneous
variability," as they are otherwise
inexplicable; seeming to be
wholly oblivious of ever having mentioned
previous degeneration. This
reminds us of another inconsistency
of which evolutionists are guilty.
They never tire of inveighing against
the reference of phenomena to what
they term "metaphysical entities,"
such as "vital power," "inherent
tendency," "intrinsic aptitude," etc.
But this by no means precludes their
use of the same phrases when treating
of phenomena which refuse to
be moulded into even seeming conformity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
to their hypotheses. Again,
these characters cannot be due to
evolution if they are a return to the
ancient progenitor of the group; for
that implies the possession of a larger
number of characters in the progenitor
than in its descendants;
which directly militates against evolution,
which is an advance from the
simpler to the more complex. But
Darwinism is in part but an ingeniously
disguised and elaborate revival
of the idea of Geoffroy St.
Hilaire. He conceived "that what
we call species are various degenerations
of the same type." Races under
nature are, upon our theory, caused
by degeneration; they are various
degenerations of a specific type.
Observing that races were thus caused,
Geoffroy St. Hilaire, we apprehend,
instituted an analogy between
races and species, and inferred from
the former being various degenerations
of a specific type, that the latter
were the various degenerations
of a generic (or a still higher) type.
He was also induced thus to conclude
by the fact that characters,
which were held in common by all
the species of a genus, were in some
species in a rudimentary state. But
the sterility of hybrids precludes the
possibility of this common origin of
the species. In so far as this hypothesis
relates to species, Darwin
adopts it. The fact that races have
been similarly caused, he ignores, as
that is grossly at variance with his
hypothesis of evolution, which lays
claim to plausibility only in the absence
of any rational explanation of
the appearance of favorable modifications
under domestication. Were
races confessed to be the degenerations
of a specific type, then it would be
apparent to the capacity of a boy
that the appearance of characters under
domestication was due to reversion.
Had not Darwin accepted the
idea of St. Hilaire, his theory would
be devoid of its present semblance
of unity and coherency. Having
started out to prove the common origin
of the species <em>by evolution</em>, he preserves
the appearance of consistency
in his illustrations by assuming an
identical conclusion, but one arrived
at, as he unwittingly shows, <i>by postulating
degeneration</i>. This furnishes
him with a seeming confirmation of
his theory; but as these hypotheses
of degeneration and evolution are
wholly incongruous, the vain endeavor
to blend them harmoniously involves
him in many inconsistencies
and absurdities. Thus, in endeavoring
to prove community of origin
of the species, he, in conformity
with the conception of degeneration,
accounts for the appearance of characters
by reversion, and then, apprehensive
that this attribution would be
wholly subversive of his theory of
development, ends by inconsistently
and gratuitously terming them instances
of evolution. The expressions
quoted above illustrate this.
He has shown that the modifications
are due to a <em>return</em> to the ancient
progenitor of the group, and then
says, "If this view be correct, we
must believe that a vast number of
characters <em>capable of evolution</em> (!) lie
hidden in every organic being."
Many other instances of this inconsistency
could be given, but the following
will, we trust, suffice. After
adducing cases of bud variation, he
says, "When we reflect on these facts,
we become deeply impressed with
the conviction that, in such cases, the
nature of the variation depends but
little on the conditions to which the
plant has been exposed, and not in
any especial manner on its individual
character, but much more on the
general nature or condition, inherited
from some remote progenitor of the
whole group of allied beings to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
the plant belongs." Mark the consistency.
The appearance of nectarines
on peach-trees by bud variation
is here ascribed to reversion, while in
numerous other places it is adduced
as one of the most striking instances
of evolution. He has cited the cases
of bud variation as instances of evolution,
to prove community of origin
of the species, and then assumes the
community of origin of the species to
account <em>by reversion</em> for the appearance
of nectarines and all bud variations.
But Darwin may go on involving
himself in a succession of
absurdities, in the just confidence
that, however gross they may be,
they will not be observable so long
as his opponents admit the evolution
of varieties.</p>

<p>On page 265, he declares it "impossible
in most cases to distinguish
between the reappearance of ancient,
and the first appearance of new characters."
This of course implies that
some characters arise by evolution.
Now, how are we to discriminate between
those arising by reversion and
those arising by evolution? What is
the distinguishing characteristic of the
latter? Darwin has failed to inform
us. We deny evolution in any case&mdash;"sport,"
strain, race, variety, or
species. Darwin takes it for granted
in the cases of "sport," strain, and
variety, after having shown degeneration
to have been almost universal.
He professes to believe that these
are due to evolution. What is evolution?
Is it not "a name for a hypothetical
property which as much
needs explanation as that which it is
used to explain"? Whence results this
belief in evolution? From intuition?
This knowledge of the existence of
such a potent factor is doubtless very
enviable, especially when it is possessed
by able scientists. But&mdash;to
follow a train of thought pursued in
another connection&mdash;it needs some
guarantee of its genuineness. For
the first impulse of a scientific scepticism
is to inquire by what means
these scientists have acquired such a
knowledge of the cause of variations.
If it was gained from a study of nature,
then it must be amenable to all
the canons of scientific research; and
these assure us that the appearance
of favorable modifications is wholly
inexplicable except upon the hypothesis
of reversion, and that evolution
is merely a name for a cause of
which we are presumed to be ignorant.
In science an explanation is
the reduction of phenomena to a series
of known conditions, thus bringing
what was unknown within the
circle of the known. Does the hypothesis
of evolution fulfil this requirement?
Has it not been confessed
that "spontaneous variability,"
or evolution, stands in the place of
ignorance? Is not the ascription of
characters to evolution a "shaping
of ignorance into the semblance
of knowledge"? Has not Darwin
shown that such it is, when he frankly
acknowledges his ignorance of the
cause of the appearance of favorable
modifications, and when he attributes
them to "an innate spontaneous
tendency"? Of what validity, then,
can an hypothesis be, when the assumption
upon which it is grounded
is, confessedly, wholly gratuitous?
Before it can be entitled to a hearing
in a scientific court of inquiry, it is
necessary that it furnish some warrant
for assuming evolution. We
rely with the most implicit confidence
upon Mr. G. H. Lewes concurring
with us in deeming this requisite.</p>

<p>On page 350, Darwin says, "Many
sub-varieties of the pigeon have reversed
and somewhat lengthened
feathers on the back of their heads,
and this is certainly not due to the
species under nature, which shows no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
trace of such a structure; but when
we remember that sub-varieties of the
fowl, the turkey, the canary-bird,
duck, and goose all have top-knots
or reversed feathers on their heads,
and when we remember that scarcely
a single natural group of birds can
be named in which some members
have not a tuft of feathers on their
heads, we may suspect that reversion
to some extremely remote form has
come into action." A high development
of the "extremely remote form,"
together with degeneration under nature
and subsequent favorable reversion,
is here manifestly implied.</p>

<p>On page 247, the tendency to prolification
is ascribed to reversion to a
former condition.</p>

<p>"With domesticated animals," says
Darwin, on page 353, "the reduction
of a part from disuse is never carried
so far that a mere rudiment is left,
but we have good reason to believe
that this has often occurred under
nature."</p>

<p>Speaking of the gradual increase in
size of our domesticated animals, he
says, "This fact is all the more striking,
as certain wild or half-wild animals,
such as red deer, aurochs, park-cattle,
and boars, have, within nearly
the same period, decreased in size."
(P. 427.)</p>

<p>On page 61, Vol. II., he says, "It
is probable that hardly a change of
any kind affects either parent without
some mark being left on the
germ. But on the doctrine of reversion,
as given in this chapter, the
germ becomes a far more marvellous
object; for besides the visible
changes to which it is subjected, we
must believe that it is crowded with
invisible characters, proper to both
sexes, to both the right and left side
of the body, and to a long line of
male and female ancestors, separated
by hundreds or even thousands of
generations from the present time;
and these characters, like those written
on paper with invisible ink, all
lie ready to be evolved (!!!) under
certain known or unknown conditions."
If this is the case, is not the
scope of reversion sufficiently wide to
cover every favorable modification
which has arisen, or may arise, under
domestication?</p>

<p>But these extracts from Darwin's
<i>Animals and Plants under Domestication</i>,
strongly confirmatory as they
are of our hypothesis, ill sustain a
comparison with the last we shall
adduce. Fuller concession no one
could reasonably desire.</p>

<p>"With species in a state of nature,"
says Darwin, on page 317, "rudimentary
organs are so extremely common
<i>that scarcely one can be mentioned</i>
which is wholly free from a blemish
of this nature." Stronger confirmation
of our hypothesis, short of a full
and unequivocal confession of its validity,
we are utterly unable to conceive.
Are we not, after this, justified
in ascribing to reversion every favorable
modification which has arisen or
may arise?</p>

<p>Having thus furnished full warrant
for assuming degeneration and subsequent
favorable reversion, and for
alleging the complete gratuitousness
of the converse assumption of evolution,
let us turn our attention to the
grand principle of natural selection.</p>

<p>It is scarcely possible to read Darwin's
graphic description of the
struggle for existence among animals
and plants, and not marvel at their
survival. Creatures under nature are
subjected to the greatest vicissitudes
of climate. Thousands are born into
the world with delicate constitutions,
inherited from their progenitors.
These enter into competition with
their fellows for the means of subsistence;
and although they eventually
succumb, they have, during their
short lives, by this competition, induced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the deterioration of their
stronger companions. All without
exception have to struggle, from the
hour of their birth to the hour of their
death, for existence. Natural extinction
carries off those whose impaired
constitutions are inconsistent with prolonged
existence. Consequent upon
natural extinction is the survival of
the fittest and strongest. Darwin avers
that the weaker portion of the species
having been carried off by natural extinction,
the next generation, having
been derived only from the stronger
portion of the race, will be of a still
stronger constitution. This is not the
case. Natural extinction does not arbitrarily
carry off the weak, but merely
those whose extremely impaired constitutions
are incompatible with life.
Many survive between which and the
conditions there is little compatibility.
And even the offspring of those
which are the strongest are subjected
in their turn to the same if not
worse conditions, and to the same
if not severer competition; for the
probability is, that the increase in the
number of animals and plants has
been great. Thus degeneration is
ever active. If the climate fails to
entail deterioration, and becomes favorable,
the same result is produced
by the severe competition consequent
upon "an astonishingly rapid
increase in numbers."</p>

<p>Darwin implies that natural selection
is something more than the correlative
of natural extinction. That
it is, he has not shown. All the facts
show that the one is merely the correlative
of the other. The semblance
of the converse being the case is
given, we conceive, by the constant
use, when speaking of those preserved
by natural selection, of the superlative,
as strongest, fittest, most vigorous.
Under nature, unfavorable
modifications are ever arising, and
those animals and plants which possess
them in a marked degree are
carried off by natural extinction.
Natural selection, in its turn, operates
merely by the preservation of those
organisms which have undergone
little or no modification. The two
factors are only different aspects of
the same process. One necessitates
the other. More than this, natural
selection is not. That it acts by the
preservation of successive favorable
modifications, Darwin has signally
failed to adduce a single instance to
prove. Instances of adaptation he
has adduced, but they are invariably,
except where man has intervened,
those of degeneration. A description
of the process of natural selection is
always accompanied with an account
of the incessant war waging throughout
nature, resulting in natural extinction.
Following this is natural
selection, preserving the fitter, stronger,
and more vigorous. Now, a tolerably
clear conception of our view
may be gained by considering that,
although those preserved may be the
fitter, stronger, and more vigorous, in
comparison with their brothers or
contemporaries, they may be&mdash;and
the vast majority of the instances
adduced by Darwin show this to be
the case&mdash;less fit, less strong, and
less vigorous than their progenitors.
Those instances adduced which do
not imply this, show no advance on
the progenitors, but merely a struggle
against degeneration and a continuance
in the same state. For animals
and plants under nature can scarcely
hold their own. Many of them are
reduced to the lowest condition compatible
with life. If they do not remain
stationary, their movement is in
the direction of degeneration. Does
not Darwin's assertion, before adverted
to, that rudimentary organs are
so extremely common that scarcely
a single species can be mentioned
which does not possess such a blemish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
imply the preëxistence of conditions
sufficiently adverse to entail
unfavorable changes in almost every
point or character in an organism?
It is not a little amusing to see that,
in numbers of the exemplifications of
the process of natural selection given
by Darwin, the animals and plants
are subjected to extreme vicissitudes
of climate, the severest competition,
and other unfavorably modifying influences,
and although deterioration
is acknowledged to result, and it is
manifest that all are unfavorably
modified, he invariably concludes
with the assertion that the strongest
and most vigorous survive. This assertion
is true in one sense, but is
false when viewed with reference to
the inference intended to be drawn.
It will be seen that the more correct
assertion would be, those survive
which have undergone less modification
or none.</p>

<p>But independently of these considerations;
even upon the supposition
that natural selection was equally
powerful with man's selection in the
formation of varieties or races, that
as strongly pronounced and as widely
divergent modifications as those
observable under domestication had
arisen under nature, the efficiency of
natural selection is a matter of no
moment. For the argument therefrom
begs the whole question. It
takes for granted the whole point
really in controversy. It assumes
that those modifications which may
arise, or which have arisen, are due
to evolution. It is not in the least
inconsistent with our views that favorable
varieties or races should arise
under nature. As a matter of fact,
we deny their ever having arisen.
But we are not by this denial estopped
from believing it possible for them
to arise in the future. For were the
conditions to change, and to become
as favorable as those to which animals
and plants are subjected under
domestication, races would then arise.
They would probably be fewer in
number, but a nearer approach to
perfection could be attained, the conditions
admitting; for man's improvement
of the animals and plants under
his care is retarded, owing to his not
being as yet perfectly conversant with
the conditions requisite for their full
development. But the modifications
which may arise under nature will be
due to reversion. The improvement
of natural species will imply their
previous degeneration. Darwin conceives
variations to arise by evolution,
and concession of this is essential to
the validity of his argument. The
question then recurs, Are the favorable
modifications which have arisen,
or which may arise, due to evolution
or to reversion? Until this point is
settled in favor of the ascription to
evolution, Darwin's argument from
natural selection is wholly irrelevant.</p>

<p>An illustration may perhaps conduce
to a clearer conception of the
relation in which the theories of evolution
and reversion stand to each
other. The following will, we believe,
fully serve this purpose.</p>

<p>Conceive a glass tube, bent into
the shape of the letter V, of which
the left leg alone is clearly visible.
In this, water is seen slowly ascending
by a succession of apparently
spontaneous impulses. "Now," argue
a certain class of philosophers, "this
is a peculiar case. The water here
manifestly does not acknowledge the
law of gravitation. It must, then,
conform to a law <i>sui generis</i>; a law
of which we are wholly ignorant; a law
which transcends the scope of our intelligence.
This law, be it what it
may, we will term evolution. Now,
as this name, given arbitrarily, is the
only explanation of which the singular
ascent of the water will admit, we
are forced to conclude that the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
will, if similarly confined above as
here below, continue to rise for ever.
Any theory other than this is inconceivable.
The assumption of a limit
to the ascent of the water is manifestly
wholly gratuitous. What evidence
is there to induce the belief that there
exists such a limit?" But would not
the calculations of these philosophers
be signally confounded by the removal
of the covering of the right leg of
the tube, disclosing the downward
course of the water from a certain
height? The analogy, we presume,
is clear to all. The ascent of the
water in the left leg answers to the
appearance of the profitable modifications
under domestication, the apex
of the tube to the existing state of
nature, and the descent of the water
in the right leg answers to degeneration
under nature; while the height
from which the water has descended
in the right leg, and to which in the
left leg it is ascending in conformity
to the rule that water always seeks its
own level, in like manner answers to
the perfect type of the species from
which the animal or plant has degenerated,
and to which it is reverting.</p>

<p>But, even assuming that the argument
from the gratuitousness of the
assumption of varietal evolution, together
with that from the explanation
afforded by the theory of reversion,
is inconclusive, there is yet another
which may be adduced.</p>

<p>Darwin's theory is condemned by
its advocates. For it is one of a class
of theories which, they contend, are
not entitled to any consideration or
hearing in a scientific court of inquiry.
Doubtless many of our readers, at
least those conversant with science,
have spent many a pleasant hour
perusing numerous well-written pages
filled with protests against the ascription
of phenomena to such entities as
"plastic force," "vital power," "intrinsic
aptitude," "inherent tendency,"
etc. This attribution is one of the
stock objections against every thing
which does not tally with the ideas
current among positivists. The advocates
of Darwin, of whom most, if
not all, are followers of Comte, wax
eloquent and enthusiastic while on
this theme. Here they disport themselves
after the manner of men conscious
of having alighted on a subject
highly calculated to call forth their
most happy thoughts. Here their
rhetoric is consummate, and their
turns of expression singularly felicitous.
Their affected indignation at
the assumed absurdity of thus accounting
for phenomena knows no
bounds. So thrilling is this tirade,
and so perfect the simulation of honest
indignation, that we, though of a
somewhat cold temperament, have,
through sympathy, often caught and
retained for a moment the infection
of enthusiasm. When our feelings
ceased to have full sway, and when
our reason returned, we were in a fit
state to appreciate fully the great
power of eloquence.</p>

<p>After animadverting thus severely
on this ascription of phenomena, it
was not to be expected that these
positivists would be guilty of the inconsistency
of advocating a theory
the basis of which was one of these
"metaphysical entities." Very little
credence, we are sure, would be given
to the assertion that the foundation
of Darwin's theory was an occult
quality. For that theory has again
and again been held up to the world
as a shining sample of what can be
effected in science by conformity to
the positive process of discovery.
Yet such is the case. Darwin, on
page 2, Vol. I. of his late work, says,
"If organic beings had not possessed
<i>an inherent tendency to vary</i>, man
could have done nothing." In numerous
other portions of his work
may be found the reference of variations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
to "an innate spontaneous tendency,"
(p. 362, Vol. I.,) to "spontaneous
or accidental variability," (p.
248. Vol. II.,) to the "nature or constitution
of the being which varies,"
(p. 289, Vol. II.,) and to "other metaphysical
entities." So frequent is the
recurrence of these expressions that it
is scarcely possible to open any portion
of his work and not alight on
one. The whole of Darwin's theory
is deduced from this occult quality in
animals and plants. And this is a
theory advocated by G. H. Lewes,
and a number of others who have
given in their adhesion to positivism!
If this explanation is, as they claim,
unphilosophical, are they not bound
to withdraw their support from such
a theory? Does not their present
position argue a total want of consistency?
Which is the more entitled
to support, even from their own professed
stand-point, a theory which
refers favorable variations to an innate
tendency in organisms, or that
which ascribes variations to reversion?
No; as any other view would
be incompatible with the success of
their darling theory, they are perfectly
content to consider variation as an
ultimate law, even though such a
consideration involves a gross inconsistency.
Regardless of this, they
advance the theory, and, when engaged
on a collateral point, marvel at
their opponents for doing that which
they have done at the start, and complacently
extol the clearness of their
own views, which have been arrived
at by the aid of an hypothesis based
upon the same occult quality against
which they are now exhausting all
their eloquence.</p>

<p>The truth is, that these "metaphysical
entities" are in almost as frequent
use among positivists as among their
adversaries. They are, perhaps,
more ingeniously disguised. But a
close examination of their speculations
will elicit the fact that they are
guilty of the same (alleged) absurdity,
and on a point, as in the present instance,
most materially affecting their
whole theory. But these explanations
are denounced as metaphysical
merely to facilitate the reception of
their finely spun theories. The dawn
of science in any department of
knowledge is invariably preceded by
a mist. This acts as a false medium,
through which the subjects of science
are dimly seen, presenting a most
monstrous aspect. This is rendered
still more distorted by the ingenious
but absurd theories of men bent
upon tracing a want of harmony between
science and religion. Their
hypotheses, at first sight, apparently
preclude the need of these phrases,
but they are at last necessitated to
use them in accounting for phenomena
of which the ascription to known
factors would be grossly at variance
with their views. The use of these
entities is in some cases only provisional
with us, to be abandoned on
the advent of true knowledge; for
religion does not shun the light of
true science. In this transitional
period between complete ignorance
and full knowledge, these speculative
theories are propounded. They purport
to furnish an explanation of all
phenomena, and to dispense with the
necessity of using "metaphysical entities."
Their adoption is necessitated,
contend their propounders, if the
converse theories are conceded to be
unscientific. This we deny, and appeal
to the existing low condition of
scientific knowledge, which precludes
for a time the possibility of the formation
of any well-founded theory.
This theory of evolution, for instance,
is confessedly founded on ignorance&mdash;ignorance
of the law to which its
data conform. But when science advances,
and when facts are exposed
to the clear sunlight of precise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
and impartial investigation, perfect
harmony is observable between science
and religion; and the absurdity
of the theories which were urged
for our adoption becomes manifest.
Past experience justifies our belief
that such will ever be the case. For
it is only those departments of knowledge
which are abandoned to speculation
which present facts seemingly
at variance with religion. We refuse
to accept the alternatives which they
offer, confident that, as they are at
variance with religion, they are not
the legitimate products of true science.</p>

<p>Races under nature have been
formed exclusively by degeneration.
By this we do not wish to imply any
innate tendency in organisms to degenerate.
The degeneration of which
we speak is solely induced by the
direct and indirect action of the conditions
of life. Upon assuming certain
conditions necessary to full
growth, the formation of natural
races becomes deductively explicable.
It is with regret that we observe a
disposition on the part of some of
the advocates of special creation to
believe growth independent of the
conditions. The dependence of
growth upon the conditions cannot
be disputed. Nor do we wish to
dispute it; for it is, to our mind,
strong confirmation of the doctrine
of final causes. The supporters of
the evolution hypothesis maintain
that an organism has the capacity for
adapting itself to any conditions, so
that they are not so marked and
sudden as to entail extinction. We
acquiesce in this thus far&mdash;where
the conditions are favorable, improvement
ensues. But with us improvement
implies previous degeneration.
And when the conditions are adverse,
a change for the worse results in proportion
to the change in the conditions.
Such adaptation as this we
admit. But we fancy Darwin would
consider this too teleological to be a
concession. Adaptation, with him,
implies harmony. This harmony we
will not gainsay. But if the conditions
induce the total or partial suppression
of any part or character, we
contend that this adaptation of the
organism to the conditions is not
consistent with complete physiological
integrity. The departure from a
state of integrity is directly proportioned
to the retardation of growth
of either the organism as a whole, or
of only one or more of its organs or
characters. This repression is the
criterion by which to judge of the
adverseness of the conditions. For
our belief in this incompatibility between
full integrity and conditions
which entail the loss or diminution
of any part, character, feature, or organ,
we will, in a future article, furnish
full warrant.</p>

<p>Starting out, then, with perfect
specific types, we will be able to account
for the formation of races
without the aid of an equivocal process,
without postulating any occult
quality, and by means in every way
analogous to those which, as Darwin
has shown, play an important part in
inducing modification.</p>

<p>From the instances of degeneration
adduced by Darwin, we may infer
that the conditions of life were at
one time extremely adverse. And
surely, if they were sufficiently unfavorable
to involve the reduction of
most important organs to a rudimentary
condition, they must also have
caused the suppression of many minor
characters. The climate in most
countries has been adequately rigorous
to act upon the organization as
a whole, and thus entail deterioration
in size; and as these unfavorable
conditions ranged from those but little
unfavorable to those barely compatible
with life, the retention of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
organism in each or several of these
stages would create diversity of size;
for climate acts with different degrees
of force in different countries. Then
in a single country the animals or
plants would be subjected to closely
similar conditions, and long continued
subjection to these would produce
uniformity of size, and indigenous
races.</p>

<p>In addition to these modifications
consequent upon the direct action of
the climate on the whole organization,
there would result minor changes.
The conditions of life would in different
districts or countries be unfavorable
to different parts or characters.
The reduction of these parts
would follow, and this would, through
correlation of growth, involve modifications
in other portions of the organization.
For, says Darwin, "all
the parts of the organization are to
a certain extent connected or correlated
together."</p>

<p>Owing to these causes there would
be disproportionate deterioration of
the characters. When an organ of
which the function is activity would
be little exercised, it would become
atrophied. Different situations would
occasion more or less disuse of organs,
and these would consequently
be differently modified. Then their
modification would call for the modification
of other characters. Thus,
the legs in some animals are made
more or less short by disuse, and by
correlation the head is reduced in
size, and changed in shape. Loss
of characters, such as the crest of
feathers on the head, and wattle,
conjoined with changes in other parts
of the organism, would, through correlation,
produce more or less diminution
in size of the skull. General
decrease in size, and loss of tail or
tail-feathers, would lessen the number
of the vertebræ, which result would
induce other changes. When the
hair is affected by humidity of climate
or other causes, the tusks, horns,
skull, and feet become modified.
There is also correlation of degeneration
between the skin and its various
appendages of hair, feathers, hoofs,
horns, and teeth; between wing-feathers
and tail-feathers; between the
various features of head and skull.</p>

<p>With animals, a small supply of
food would cause decrease in size;
and with plants, an insufficient quantity
of the necessary chemical elements,
together with the starvation
consequent upon the close contiguity
of other plants, would produce the
same result. Diseases peculiar to
certain localities, heights, and climates
have also played their part in the
modification of animals and plants.</p>

<p>Given, then, a perfect type, the
unfavorable action of these elements&mdash;heat
and cold, dampness and dryness,
light and electricity, disuse, disease,
absence of some of the necessary
chemical elements, and insufficient
supplies of food&mdash;together with
that of their countless modifications,
acting separately and conjointly, directly
and indirectly through correlation,
is amply adequate to the production
of the modifications by
which, as we conceive, races have
been formed.</p>

<p>That it is possible for characters to
appear after having been lost for a
great length of time, is amply shown
by Darwin in his chapters on reversion.
Individuals of breeds of cattle
that have been hornless for the
last one hundred or one hundred
and fifty years occasionally give
birth to horned calves. Characters,
he assures us, may recur after
an almost indefinite number of generations.
"From what we see of
the power of reversion, both in pure
races and when varieties or species
are crossed, we may infer that characters
of almost any kind are capable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
of reappearance after having been
lost for a great length of time."
Speaking of the transmission of color
during centuries, he says, "Nevertheless,
there is no more inherent improbability
in this being the case
than in a useless and rudimentary
organ, or even in only a tendency to
the production of a rudimentary organ,
being inherent during millions
of generations, as is well known to
occur with a multitude of organic beings.
There is no more inherent impossibility
in each domestic pig, during
a thousand generations, retaining
the capacity to develop great tusks
under fitting conditions, than in the
young calf having retained for an
indefinite number of generations rudimentary
incisor teeth which never
protrude through the gums." The
power of reversion is further shown
in the cases of pelorism before given.
And again, he urges that, "It should
also be remembered that many characters
lie latent in organisms ready
to be evolved (?) under fitting conditions."
But it is scarcely necessary
to adduce proofs of the possibility of
reversion; for, if characters arise in
species which have confessedly degenerated,
it is the height of absurdity
to attribute them to evolution,
rather than to reversion.</p>

<p>Many objections, we are sure, will
suggest themselves, and many doubts
will be expressed whether the theory
here enunciated will cover all the
facts. We feel confident of succeeding
in obviating every difficulty, and
in dissipating all such doubts. In
this article we have shown upon
what an infirm basis the evolution
hypothesis rests, and have suggested
a legitimate alternative. In our
forthcoming articles, we shall show
still further weakness of the views of
Darwin and Spencer, and point out
facts which, while grossly at variance
with the development doctrines, afford
conclusive proof of the objective
reality of the species.</p>

<h2>HAYDN'S FIRST LESSONS IN MUSIC AND LOVE.</h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>The Hungarians, like the Austrians
and Bohemians, have great love for
music. "Three fiddles and a dulcimer
for two houses," says the proverb;
and it is a true one. It is not
unusual, therefore, for some out of
the poorer classes, when their regular
business fails to bring them in sufficient
for their wants, to take to the
fiddle, the dulcimer, or the harp,
playing on holidays on the highway
or in taverns. This employment is
generally lucrative enough, if they
are not spendthrifts, to enable them
not only to live, but to lay by something
for future necessities.</p>

<p>An honest wheelwright, called
"merry Jobst," on account of his
stories and jokes, lived with Elschen
his wife, in a cottage in the hamlet
Rohrau, on the borders of Hungary
and Austria. They were accustomed
to sit by the wayside near the inn on
holidays; Jobst fiddling, and Elschen
playing the harp and singing
with her sweet, clear voice. Almost
every traveller stopped to listen, well
pleased, and on resuming his journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
threw often a silver twopence into
the lap of the pretty young woman.
Jobst and his wife, on returning home
in the evening, found their day's work
a good one.</p>

<p>The old cantor of the neighboring
town of Haimburg passed along the
road one afternoon, and in the arbor,
opposite the tavern, sat merry Jobst
fiddling, and beside him pretty Elschen,
playing the harp and singing.
Between them, on the ground, sat a
little chubby-faced boy about three
years old, who had a small board
shaped like a violin hung about his
neck, on which he played with a willow
twig as with a genuine fiddle-bow.
The most comical and surprising
thing of all was, that the little
man kept perfect time, pausing when
his father paused and his mother had
a solo, then falling in with his father
again, and demeaning himself exactly
like him. Often, too, he would
lift up his clear voice, and join distinctly
in the refrain of the song.</p>

<p>"Is that your boy, fiddler?" asked
the music-teacher.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, that is my little Seperl."<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>"The little fellow seems to have a
taste for music."</p>

<p>"Why not? I shall take him as
soon as I can to one who can teach
him."</p>

<p>The cantor came from this time
twice a week to the house of merry
Jobst to talk with him about his little
son, and the youngster himself was
soon the best of friends with the
good-natured old man. So matters
went on for two years, at the end of
which time the cantor said to Jobst,
"If you will trust your boy with me,
I will take him, and teach him what
he must learn to become a brave lad
and skilful musician."</p>

<p>Jobst did not hesitate long, for he
saw clearly how great an advantage
the instruction of Master Wolferl
would be to his son. And though it
went harder with pretty Elschen to
part with Joseph, who was her only
child, yet she gave up at last. She
packed up the boy's scanty wardrobe
in a bundle, gave him a slice of bread
and salt and a cup of milk, embraced
and blessed him, and accompanied
him to the door of the cottage,
where she signed him with the sign
of the cross three times, and then returned
to her chamber. Jobst went
with them half way to Haimburg,
and then returned, while Wolferl and
Joseph pursued their way till they
reached Wolferl's house, the end of
their journey.</p>

<p>Wolferl was an old bachelor, but
one whose heart, despite his gray
hairs, was still youthful and warm.
He gave daily lessons to the little
Joseph, and taught him good principles,
as well as how to sing and to
play on the horn and kettle-drum;
and Joseph profited thereby, as well
as by the other instructions he received
in music.</p>

<p>Years passed, and Joseph was a
well-instructed boy; he had a voice
as clear and fine as his mother's, and
played the violin as well as his father;
he likewise blew the horn, and
beat the kettle-drum, in the sacred
music prepared by Wolferl for church
festivals. Better than all, Joseph
had a true and honest heart; had
the fear of God continually before
his eyes, and was ever contented, and
wished well to all.</p>

<p>The more Wolferl perceived the
lad's wonderful talent for art, the
more earnestly he sought to find a
patron for him, for he felt that his
own strength could reach little further,
when he saw the zeal and ability
with which his pupil devoted himself
to his studies. Providence so
ordered it at length that Master von
Reuter, chapel-master and musical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
director in St. Stephen's Church, Vienna,
came to visit the deacon at
Haimburg. The deacon told Master
von Reuter of the extraordinary
boy, the son of the wheelwright Jobst
Haydn, the pupil of old Wolferl,
and created in the chapel-master
much desire to become acquainted
with him. The next morning, accordingly,
Von Reuter went to Wolferl's
house, which he entered quietly
and unannounced. Joseph was sitting
alone at the organ, playing a
simple but sublime piece of sacred
music from an old German master.
Reuter, astonished and delighted,
stood at the door and listened attentively.
The boy was so deep in his
music that he did not perceive the
intruder till the piece was concluded,
when, accidentally turning round, he
fixed upon the stranger his large dark
eyes, expressive of astonishment indeed,
but sparkling a friendly welcome.</p>

<p>"Very well played, my son!" said
Von Reuter at last. "Where is your
foster-father?"</p>

<p>"In the garden," said the boy;
"shall I call him?"</p>

<p>"Call him, and say to him that
the chapel-master Von Reuter wishes
to speak to him. Stop a moment!
You are Joseph Haydn, are you
not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am Seperl."</p>

<p>"Well, then, go."</p>

<p>Joseph went and brought his old
master, Wolferl, who with uncovered
head and low obeisance welcomed
the chapel-master and music director
at St. Stephen's to his humble abode.
Von Reuter, on his part, praised the
musical skill of his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</i>, inquired
particularly concerning the lad's attainments,
and examined him formally
himself. Joseph passed the examination
in such a manner that Reuter's
satisfaction increased with every
answer. After this he spent some
time in close conference with old
Wolferl; and it was near noon before
he took his departure. Joseph was
invited to accompany him and spend
the rest of the day at the deacon's.</p>

<p>Eight days after, old Wolferl, Jobst,
and pretty Elschen, the younger son,
little Michael, on her lap, sat very dejectedly
together, and talked of the
good Joseph, who had gone that
morning with Master von Reuter to
Vienna, to take his place as chorister
in St. Stephen's church.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Wenzel Puderlein, a noted hair-dresser
in the Leopoldstadt of Vienna,
was one day dressing the hair of
the Baron von Swieten, first physician
to the empress, when he heard the
great man's son ask permission to
present to him a wonderful young
musician, whose talents were beginning
to attract public attention. Puderlein
was happy to say he knew all
about him, having long been hair-dresser
to the chapel-master Von Reuter,
in whose house young Haydn
had lived ten or eleven years. He
had been chorister at St. Stephen's,
but had been obliged to relinquish
the position two years before, having
lost his fine, clear soprano voice after
a severe illness.</p>

<p>"And what does young Haydn
now?" asked the baron.</p>

<p>"Ah! your honor, the poor fellow
must find it hard to live by giving
lessons, playing, and thus picking up
what he can; he sometimes also composes,
or what do they call it? He
lives in the house with Metastasio;
not in the first story, like the court
poet, but in the fifth; and when it is
winter, he has to lie in bed and work,
to keep himself from freezing; he has
a fireplace in his chamber, but no
money to buy wood to burn therein."</p>

<p>"This must not be; this shall not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
be!" cried the Baron von Swieten, as
he rose from his seat. "Am I
ready?"</p>

<p>"One moment, your honor&mdash;only
the string around the hair-bag."</p>

<p>"It is very good as it is. Now
begone!"</p>

<p>Puderlein vanished.</p>

<p>"And you, help me on with my
coat, give me my stick and hat, and
bring me your young teacher this
afternoon." Therewith he departed;
and young Von Swieten, full of joy,
went to the writing-table to indite an
invitation to Haydn to come to his
father's house.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Joseph Haydn sat sorrowful,
and almost despairing, in his
chamber. He had passed the morning,
contrary to his usual custom, in
idle brooding over his condition.
Now it appeared quite hopeless, and
his cheerfulness seemed about to take
leave of him for ever, like his only
friend and protectress, Mademoiselle
de Martinez. That young lady had left
the city a few hours before. Haydn
had instructed her in singing, and in
playing the harpsichord; and by way
of recompense, he enjoyed the privilege
of boarding and lodging in the
fifth story in the house of Metastasio.
All this now ceased with the lady's departure,
and Joseph was poorer than
before; for all that he had saved he had
sent conscientiously to his parents,
only keeping so much as sufficed to
furnish him with decent though plain
clothing.</p>

<p>"But where now?" thought he;
and asked himself, sobbing aloud,
"Where shall I go, without money?"</p>

<p>Just then, without any previous
knocking, the door of his chamber
was opened, and, with bold carriage
and sparkling eyes, entered Master
Wenzel Puderlein.</p>

<p>"Come to me!" cried the hair-dresser,
while he stretched his curling-irons
like a sceptre toward Joseph, and
pressed his powder-bag with an air of
feeling to his heart. "To me! I will
be your father; I will foster and protect
you; for I have feeling for the
grand and the sublime, and have discerned
your genius. I will lead you
to art&mdash;I myself; and if, before long,
you be not in full chase, and have
not captured her, why, you must be
a fool, and I will give you up!"</p>

<p>"Ah! worthy Master Puderlein,"
cried Haydn, surprised, "you would
not receive me when I know not
where to go nor what to do?"</p>

<p>"Now, sit you down on that
stool," said Puderlein, "and do not
stir till I give you leave. I will show
the world what a man of genius can
make of an indifferent head."</p>

<p>"Are you determined, then, to do
me the honor of dressing my hair,
Master von Puderlein?"</p>

<p>"Ask no questions; but sit still."</p>

<p>Joseph obediently seated himself,
and Wenzel began to dress his hair
according to the latest mode.</p>

<p>When he had done, he said with
much self-congratulation, "Really,
Haydn, when I look at you and think
what you were before I set your head
right, and what you are now, I may,
without presumption, call you a being
of my own creation. Now pay
attention: you are to dress yourself
as quickly as possible, and collect
your movables together, that I may
send to fetch them this evening.
Then betake yourself to the Leopoldstadt,
to my house on the Danube,
No. 7; go up the steps, knock at
the door, present my compliments to
the young lady my daughter, and tell
her you are so and so, and that Master
von Puderlein sent you; and if
you are hungry and thirsty, call for
something to eat and a glass of Ofener
or Klosteruenburger; after which you
may remain quiet till I come home,
and tell you further what I design for
you. Adieu!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>Therewith Master Wenzel Puderlein
rolled himself out of the door,
and Joseph stood awhile with his hair
admirably well dressed, but a little disconcerted,
in the middle of his chamber.
When he had collected his
thoughts at length, he gave thanks with
tears to God, who had inclined the
heart of his generous protector toward
him, and put an end to his bitter necessity;
then he gathered, as Puderlein
had told him, his few clothes and
many musical notes together, dressed
himself carefully in his best, shut
up his chamber, and after he had taken
leave, not without emotion, of the
rich Metastasio, walked away cheerfully
and confidently, his heart full of
joy and his head full of new melodies,
toward the Leopoldstadt and
the house of his patron.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>When young Von Swieten came
half an hour later to ask for the young
composer, Signor Metastasio could
not inform him where "Giuseppe"
had gone. How many hours of despondency
did this forgetfulness on
the part of the renowned poet prepare
for the poor, unknown, yet incomparably
greater artist, Haydn!</p>

<p>When Joseph, after a long walk,
stood at length before Puderlein's
house, he experienced some novel
sensations, which may have been
consequent on the thought that he
was to introduce himself to a young
lady and converse with her; an idea
which, from his constitutional bashfulness
and his ignorance of the world,
was rather formidable to him. But
the step must be taken, nevertheless.
He summoned all his courage and
knocked at the door. It was opened,
and a handsome damsel of eighteen
or nineteen presented herself before
the trembling young man.</p>

<p>In great embarrassment he faltered
forth his compliments and his message
from Master Wenzel. The pretty
Nanny listened to him with an expression
of pleasure, and of sympathy
for the forlorn condition of her visitor.
When he had ended, she took him by
the hand, to his no small terror, without
the least embarrassment, and led
him into the parlor, saying in insinuating
tones, "Come in, Master Haydn;
it is all right. I am sure my papa
means well with you; for he concerns
himself for every dunce he meets,
and would take a poor wretch in for
having only good hair on his head!
But you must give in to his humors a
little; for he is sometimes a trifle peculiar.
Now tell me, what will you
have? Do not be bashful; it is a
good while since noon, and you must
be hungry from your long walk."</p>

<p>Joseph could not deny that such
was the case, and modestly asked for
a piece of bread and a glass of water.
Nanny, laughing, tripped out of the
room. Ere long she returned, followed
by an apprentice whom she had
loaded with cold meats, a flask of
wine, tumblers, etc. She arranged
the table, filled Joseph's glass, and
invited him to help himself to the
cold pastry and whatever else awaited
his choice. The youth fell to,
timidly at first, then with more courage,
till, after he had, at Nanny's
persuasion, emptied a couple of
glasses, he took heart to attack the
cold meats more vigorously than he
had done for a long time before; making
the observation mentally that if
Mademoiselle Nanny Puderlein was
not quite as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">distingué</i> and accomplished
as his departed patroness, the honored
Mademoiselle de Martinez, still,
as far as youth, beauty, and polite
manners were concerned, she would
not suffer by a comparison with the
most distinguished dames in Vienna.
When Master Wenzel Puderlein
came home an hour or two later, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
found Joseph in high spirits, with
sparkling eyes and cheeks like the
rose, already more than half in love
with the pretty Nanny.</p>

<p>Joseph Haydn lived thus many
months in the house of Wenzel Puderlein,
burgher and renowned <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">friseur</i>
in the Leopoldstadt of Vienna, and
not a man in the imperial city knew
where the poor but gifted and well-educated
artist and composer was
gone. In vain he was sought by his
few friends; in vain by young Von
Swieten; in vain, at last, by Metastasio
himself. Joseph had disappeared
from Vienna without leaving a
trace. Wenzel Puderlein kept his
abode carefully concealed, and wondered
and lamented, like the rest,
over his loss, when his aristocratic
customers, believing he knew every
thing, asked him if he could give
them any information as to what had
become of Joseph. He thought he
had good reason and undoubted
right to exercise now the hitherto
unpractised virtue of silence; because,
as he said to himself, he only
aimed at making Joseph the happiest
man in the world!</p>

<p>Joseph cheerfully resigned himself
to the purposes of his friend, and was
only too happy to be able undisturbed
to study Sebastian Bach's works,
to try his skill in composing quartettos,
to eat as much as he wanted,
and, day after day, to see and chat
with the fair Nanny. It never occurred
to him to notice that he lived,
in a manner, as a prisoner in Puderlein's
house; that all day he was
banished to the garden behind the
dwelling or to his own snug chamber,
and only permitted to go out in the
evening with Wenzel and his daughter.
It never occurred to him to
wish for other acquaintances than
their nearest neighbors, among whom
he was known simply as "Master
Joseph;" and he cheerfully delivered
every Saturday to Master Wenzel the
stipulated number of minuets, waltzes,
etc., which he was ordered to compose.
Puderlein carried the pieces
regularly to a music-dealer in the
Leopoldstadt, who paid him two
convention-guilders for every full-toned
minuet, and for other pieces in
proportion. This money the hair-dresser
conscientiously locked up in
a chest, to use it, when the time
should come, for Joseph's advantage.
With this view, he inquired
earnestly about Joseph's greater
works, and whether he would not
soon be prepared to produce something
which would do him credit in
the eyes of the more distinguished
part of the public.</p>

<p>"Ah! yes, indeed," replied the
young man. "This quartetto, when
I shall have finished it, might be ventured
before the public; for I hope
to make something good of it. Yet
what can I do? No publisher
would take it, because I have no distinguished
patron to whom I could
dedicate it!"</p>

<p>"That will all come in time," said
Puderlein, smiling. "Do you get
the thing ready, yet without neglecting
the dances."</p>

<p>Joseph went to work; yet every
day he appeared more deeply in love
with the pretty Nanny; and the damsel
herself looked with very evident
favor on the dark though handsome
youth. Wenzel saw the progress of
things with satisfaction; the lovers
behaved with great propriety, and he
suffered matters to go on in their
own way, only interfering, with a little
assumed surliness, if Joseph at any
time forgot his tasks in idle talk, or
Nanny her housekeeping.</p>

<p>But not with such eyes saw Mosjo
Ignatz, Puderlein's journeyman and
factotum hitherto; for he thought
himself possessed of a prior claim to
the love of Nanny. It was gall and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
wormwood to Ignatz to see Joseph
and the fair girl together. He would
often fain have interposed his powder-bag
and curling-irons between
them when he heard them singing
tender duets; for Nanny had really
a charming voice, was very fond of
music, and was Joseph's zealous pupil
in singing.</p>

<p>At length Ignatz could no longer
endure the torments of jealousy.
One morning he sought out the master
of the house, to discover to him
the secret of the lovers. How great
was his astonishment when Master
Wenzel, instead of falling into a violent
passion and turning Joseph out
of doors without further ado, replied,
with a smile, that he was well pleased
to have it so. In vain Ignatz urged
his own prior claims to Nanny's favor,
and the encouragement he had received
from father and daughter.
His pretensions were treated with
the utmost scorn.</p>

<p>The journeyman declared he would
instantly quit the hair-dresser's treacherous
roof, and him and his periwig
stock. He hastened to pack up his
goods, demanded and received his
wages, and left the house vowing
vengeance against its inmates. Puderlein
was incensed; Nanny laughed;
Joseph sat in the garden, troubling
himself about nothing but his
quartetto, at which he was working.</p>

<p>Wenzel Puderlein saw the hour
approaching when the attention of
the imperial city, and of the world,
would be directed to him as the protector
and benefactor of a great musical
genius. The dances Joseph had
composed for the music-dealer in
the Leopoldstadt were played again
and again in the halls of the nobility.
All praised the lightness, the sprightliness
and grace that distinguished
them; but all inquiries were
vain, at the music-dealer's, respecting
the name of the composer. None
knew him, and Joseph himself had
no idea what a sensation the pieces
he had thrown off so easily created
in the world. Master Wenzel, however,
was well aware of it, and waited
with impatience the completion
of the first quartetto. At length the
manuscript was ready. Puderlein received
it, took it to the music publisher,
and had it sent to press immediately,
which the sums he had from
time to time laid by for Joseph enabled
him to do. Haydn, who was confident
his protector would do every thing
for his advantage, committed all to
his hands; he commenced a new
quartetto, and the old one was soon
nearly forgotten.</p>

<p>They were not forgotten, however,
by Mosjo Ignatz Schuppenpelz, who
was continually on the watch to play
Master Puderlein some ill trick.
The opportunity soon offered; his
new principal sent him one morning
to dress the hair of the Baron von
Fürnberg. Young Von Swieten chanced
to be at the baron's house, and
in the course of conversation mentioned
the balls frequently given by
Prince Esterhazy, and the delightful
new dances by the unknown composer.
In the warmth of his description
the youth stepped up to the
piano and began a piece which caused
Ignatz to prick up his ears, for he
recognized it too well; it was Nanny's
favorite waltz, which Joseph had
executed expressly for her.</p>

<p>"I would give fifty ducats," cried
the baron, when Von Swieten had
ended, "to know the name of the
composer."</p>

<p>"Fifty ducats!" repeated Ignatz.
"Your honor, I can tell your honor
the name of the composer."</p>

<p>"If you can, and with certainty,
the fifty ducats are yours," answered
Fürnberg and Von Swieten.</p>

<p>"I can, your honor. It is Pepi
Haydn."</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>"How? Joseph Haydn? How
do you know? Speak!" cried both
gentlemen to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">friseur</i>, who proceeded
to inform them of Haydn's
abode and seclusion in the house of
Wenzel Puderlein; nor did the ex-journeyman
lose the opportunity of
be-powdering his ancient master plentifully
with abuse as an old miser,
a surly fool, and an arch tyrant.</p>

<p>"Horrible!" cried his auditors,
when Ignatz had concluded his story.
"Horrible! This old <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">friseur</i> makes
the poor young man, hidden from all
the world, labor to gratify his avarice,
and keeps him prisoner! We must
set him at liberty."</p>

<p>Ignatz assured the gentlemen they
would perform a good deed by doing
so; and informed them when it was
likely Puderlein would be from home,
so that they could find an opportunity
of speaking alone with young
Haydn. Young Von Swieten resolved
to go that very morning, during
the absence of Puderlein, to seek his
favorite; and took Ignatz along with
him. The hair-dresser was not a little
elated to be seated opposite the
baron, in a handsome coach, which
drove rapidly toward Leopoldstadt.
When they stopped before Puderlein's
house, Ignatz remained in the coach,
while the baron alighted, entered the
house, and ran up stairs to the chamber
before pointed out to him, where
Joseph Haydn sat deep in the composition
of a new quartetto.</p>

<p>Great was the youth's astonishment
when he perceived his distinguished
visitor. He did not utter a
word, but kept bowing to the ground.
Von Swieten, however, hesitated not
to accost him with all the ardor of
youth, and described the affliction of
his friends (who they were Joseph
knew not) at his mysterious disappearance.
Then he spoke of the applause
his compositions had received,
and of the public curiosity to know
who the admirable composer was
and where he lived. "Your fortune
is now made," concluded he. "The
Baron von Fürnberg, a connoisseur,
my father, I myself&mdash;we will all receive
you; we will present you to
Prince Esterhazy; so make ready to
quit this house, and to escape, the
sooner the better, from the illegal
and unworthy tyranny of an avaricious
periwig-maker."</p>

<p>Joseph knew not what to reply;
for with every word of Von Swieten
his astonishment increased. At
length he faltered, blushing, "Your
honor is much mistaken, if you think
I am tyrannized over in this house;
on the contrary, Master Puderlein
treats me as his own son, and his
daughter loves me as a brother. He
took me in when I was helpless and
destitute, without the means of earning
my bread."</p>

<p>"Be that as it may," interrupted
young Von Swieten impatiently, "this
house is no longer your home; you
must go into the great world under
very different auspices, worthy of
your talents. To-morrow the baron
and I come to fetch you away."
Therewith he embraced young
Haydn with cordiality, quitted the
house, and drove back to the city,
while Joseph stood and rubbed his
forehead, and hardly knew whether
all was a dream or reality.</p>

<p>But the pretty Nanny, who, listening
in the kitchen, had heard all, ran in
grief and affright to meet her father
when he came home, and told him
every thing.</p>

<p>Puderlein was dismayed; but he
soon collected himself, and commanded
his daughter to follow him, and
to put her handkerchief to her eyes.</p>

<p>Thus prepared, he went up to
Haydn's chamber. Joseph, as soon
as he heard him coming, opened the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
door and went to meet him, to inform
him of the strange visit he had
received.</p>

<p>But Puderlein pushed him back
into the chamber, entered himself,
followed by the weeping Nanny, and
cried in a pathetic tone, "I know all;
you have betrayed me, and are now
going to leave me like a vagabond."</p>

<p>"Surely not, Master Puderlein.
But listen to me."</p>

<p>"I will not listen! Your treachery
is clear; your falsehood to me and to
my daughter! O ingratitude! see
here thine image. I loved this boy
as my own son. I received him, when
he was destitute, under my hospitable
roof; clothed and fed him. I have
dressed his hair with my own hands,
and labored for his renown; and for
my thanks, he has betrayed me and
my innocent daughter!"</p>

<p>"Master Puderlein, listen to me.
I will not be ungrateful; on the contrary,
I will thank you all the days
of my life for what you have done for
me."</p>

<p>"And marry that girl?"</p>

<p>"Marry her?" repeated Joseph,
astonished. "Marry her? I&mdash;your
daughter?"</p>

<p>"Who else? Have you not told
her she was handsome? that you
liked her?"</p>

<p>"I have indeed; but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No buts; you must <em>marry</em> her,
or you are a shameless traitor!
Think you a virtuous damsel of Vienna
lets every callow bird tell her she
is handsome and agreeable? My innocent
Nanny thought you wished to
marry her, and made up her mind
honestly to have you. She loves
you; and now will you desert her
and leave her to grief and shame?"</p>

<p>Joseph stood in dejected silence.
Puderlein continued, "And I&mdash;have
I deserved such black ingratitude
from you, eh? have I?" With these
words, Master Wenzel drew forth a
roll of paper, unfolded and held it up
before the disconcerted Joseph, who
uttered an exclamation of surprise as
he read these words engraved on it,
"Quartetto for two violins, bass viol,
and violoncello. Composed by Master
Joseph Haydn, performer and composer
in Vienna. Vienna, 1751."</p>

<p>"Yes!" cried Puderlein, triumphantly,
when he saw Haydn's joyful
surprise&mdash;"yes, cry out and make
your eyes as large as bullets. I did
that; with the money I received in
payment for your dances I paid for
paper and press-work, that you might
present the public with a great work.
Still more: I have labored to such
purpose among my customers of rank
that you have the appointment of
organist to the Carmelites. Here is
your appointment. Now go, ingrate,
and bring my daughter and me with
sorrow to the grave."</p>

<p>Joseph went not; with tears in his
eyes he threw himself into Puderlein's
arms, who struggled and resisted vigorously,
as if he would have repelled
him. But Joseph held him fast, saying,
"Master Puderlein! listen to
me! There is no treachery in me!
Let me call you father; give me Nanny
for my wife."</p>

<p>Master Wenzel was at last quiet.
He sank exhausted into an arm-chair,
and cried to the young couple,
"Come hither, my children; kneel
before me, that I may give you my
blessing. This evening shall be the
betrothal, and a month hence we will
have the wedding."</p>

<p>Joseph and Nanny knelt down
and received the paternal benediction.
All was festivity in No. 7,
on the Danube, that evening, when
the organist, Joseph Haydn, was solemnly
betrothed to the fair Nanny,
the daughter of Wenzel Puderlein,
burgher and proprietor in the Leopoldstadt
in Vienna.</p>

<p>The Baron Von Fürnberg and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
young Von Swieten were not a
little astonished, when they came
the next morning to take Haydn
from Puderlein's house, to find
him affianced to the pretty Nanny.
They remonstrated with him
earnestly in private; but Joseph remained
immovable, and kept his
word, pledged to Puderlein and his
bride, like an honorable young man.</p>

<p>At a later period he had reason to
acknowledge that the step he had
taken was somewhat precipitate; but
he never repented it, and consoled
himself, when his earthly muse
caused a little discord among his
tones, with the companionship of that
immortal partner, ever lovely, ever
young, who attends the skilful artist
through life, and who proved herself
so true to him that the name of
Joseph Haydn shall, after the lapse
of centuries, be pronounced with joyful
and sacred emotion by our latest
posterity.</p>

<p class="center">FROM THE REVUE DU MONDE CATHOLIQUE.</p>

<h2>A SKETCH OF THE IRISH VOLUNTEERS.<br />

<small>BY COUNT FRANK RUSSELL KILLOUGH, LATE OF THE PONTIFICAL ARMY.</small></h2>


<p>It was worthy of Catholic Ireland,
that noble daughter of the church,
which has preserved intact the faith
of St. Patrick in the midst of struggles,
trials, and persecutions of every
kind, to send to the pope a legion of
her sons to fight beside the generous
volunteers whom every vessel brought
from France, Belgium, Germany, and
Switzerland. As my thoughts revert,
after an interval of eight years, to
this noble band, whose organization
I superintended temporarily, I love
to recall the great natural qualities
which redeemed their defects, and,
despite their disorders and uproar, and
their incessant quarrels, won for the
Irish the admiration of Lamoricière,
and merited the approval of the pope,
who, after the crisis, desired to form
around him a guard of these valiant
soldiers, these indomitable heroes,
these Catholics faithful to the death.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in the midst of the
fatigues and excitement of this period,
amid marches and countermarches,
orders and countermands, it was impossible
for me to keep a journal of
the thousand and one strange incidents,
daily events, interesting or
amusing, of which I was a witness;
indeed, they would furnish Alexander
Dumas abundant matter for dramas
and endless tales. I must limit myself
to those scenes which have left
the deepest impression on my memory.</p>

<p>The 30th of May, 1860, found me
in garrison in a small hamlet on the
frontiers of Tuscany, Titta della Pieve,
situated some leagues from Lake Trasimene,
famous for the struggle between
Hannibal and the Romans,
which took place upon its border.
Thence a sudden order despatched
me to Macerata, a small town of the
Adriatic Marches, where I was to organize
the Irish Legion. Already a
hundred and fifty recruits had arrived,
and the order was couched in
terms admitting of no delay. I left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
with regret, for in this little hamlet I
had found a family, whose hospitality
had touched me. It was that of
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gonfalonnier</i>.</p>

<p>The young matron, simple in her
tastes, well educated, and handsome
as Italians naturally are, had undertaken
by her kindness to make us
forget the ungracious reception which
our uniform had won for us in Perugian
society. And in this she manifested
not only sound judgment and
education, but also rare courage, at
this dangerous time, when the least
respect toward a pontifical officer
merited the stroke of the assassin's
dagger. A little later, I was to find
her in Rome, proscribed for her fidelity
by a violent, iniquitous, and vindictive
government. Will she be
able to return to her home despite
the cruel vexations to which she has
been exposed? I know not, and
dare not hope any thing of Piedmontese
mercy. Could I separate myself
from that noble Swiss regiment,
dear for so many reasons, beneath the
shadow of whose flag I for the first
time drew my sword for the pope?
Alas! I was obliged to quit for a long
time, perhaps, my brethren in arms,
whose friendship had become a pleasure
and encouragement and even a
necessity, to find in a new corps new
associates; and this at the moment
when great events were vaguely rumored,
when each could foresee the
necessity of all that was dear to brace
up against the storm, whose distant
echoes were already to be heard.
But military obedience exacted this
sacrifice. I left early on the following
morning, and, after escaping an attack
on the diligence by twelve masked
brigands, in the gorges of the Apennines,
I arrived at Macerata on
June 1st.</p>

<p>I immediately received a visit from
the almoner of the volunteers, whose
appearance deserves particular description.</p>

<p>He was an Irish Franciscan father,
and by his lofty stature and sonorous
eloquence reminded me of
the portrait of the great O'Connell,
which in my childhood I had seen
traced by enthusiastic admirers of
his oratory. When Father Bonaventure
appeared in the midst of the recruits,
the men made way for him respectfully.
One of them had been
guilty of some breach of discipline.
The priest spoke sweetly to him, and a
few words of tender severity brought
tears to the eyes of the offender. Indeed,
this monk, with his lofty brow
and stately gait, his coarse habit falling
in ample folds from his massive
shoulders, was well calculated to impress
these children of nature, at
once simple but keen, enthusiastic but
fickle, good in heart but hasty in
character, on whom the priest alone
has fitted the yoke of authority.</p>

<p>I immediately saw the necessity of
establishing the best possible relations
with this influential man. The preliminaries
of our conversation being
ended, he said, "My dear captain,
will you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, reverend father, but
you give me a title to which I have
no right. I am only a lieutenant."</p>

<p>"Why, captain dear, this will never
do. I have announced to the recruits
the arrival of their <i>captain</i>; they are
prepared to receive you, and all the
prestige of your authority will be lost
if they find that you are only a lieutenant.
No; permit me without offence
to attribute to you the rank to
which you won't be long coming, if
all that I have heard of you be true."</p>

<p>"You flatter me infinitely, and I
am much obliged for your high opinion;
but as we have many things to
do, let us save our compliments for
some future occasion, and look at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
men, whom I must inspect without
delay."</p>

<p>"Immediately, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon cher commandant</span>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Still another thing, Monsieur
l'Aumonier&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They are in the barracks, and I will
present you to them. Come with
me; these good fellows await you
with impatience, and I hope you will
be pleased with them. Remember,
you are captain."</p>

<p>I found the recruits, about a hundred
and fifty in number, ranged in
two lines along the vast corridor, and I
must confess that my first impression
was not favorable. They were for
the most part ragged, evidently fatigued
by the long voyage. A long
bench stood before them.</p>

<p>"We must remove this bench,"
said I to the priest. "It will be in
the way during my inspection."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it, captain dear,"
he answered; "on the contrary, it
will assist wonderfully for the ceremony
of your presentation. You are
shorter than I, and my height destroys
the effect that you ought to produce,
(he was six feet eight inches in stature.)
Get up on that bench, and
you will appear as tall as I, and your
prestige will increase proportionally."</p>

<p>"All right, reverend father; here
goes for the bench. You are a decided
master of scenic art."</p>

<p>I acted on his advice, and mounted
my platform, while the chaplain
prepared his countenance and attitude
for the grand discourse that was to
follow. He waited for silence, and,
when he saw all eyes directed toward
me and all ears open to him,</p>

<p>"Boys," he said, swinging with
majestic movement the loose sleeves
of his habit, "welcome this happy
day, the object of your ardent desires,
on which you will enjoy the honor
of enrolling yourselves in the army
of the sovereign pontiff, and on
which your names, children of St.
Patrick, will be inscribed on the great
list of the defenders of the papacy.
You see before you, at this moment,
the representative of that august sovereign
for whom your Irish and Catholic
hearts beat with filial love.
Welcome with acclamations him
whom God has sent us&mdash;the illustrious
Captain Russell," (here he laid his
heavy hand on my head as if he
wished to flatten it,) "the noble descendant
of your ancient kings, the worthy
nephew of the gallant Marshal
McMahon, the hero of Perugia, into
whose hands I gladly resign the authority
which I have hitherto exercised.
Now, boys, from the bottom of
your throats, hurrah for Captain Russell."</p>

<p>"Hurrah for the captain!" shouted
the hundred and fifty.</p>

<p>"And you, captain," (here he turned
his great, benevolent eyes toward
me,) "whom the pope has invested
with the powers of commander until
the arrival of their regular chief, consider
in the goodness of your heart
the devotion of these true sons of
Ireland, who, abandoning their homes
and families, came through fatigues,
dangers, and privations, over mountains
and seas, to place at your disposal
their lives, their strength, and their
heart's blood."</p>

<p>I answered this harangue as well
as I could, giving with all my might
a hurrah for the pope, which was repeated
along the line; then, descending
from my pedestal, I shook warmly
the hand of the reverend chaplain,
to testify publicly my trust in him,
and, after the inspection, occupied
myself immediately in forming the
companies. Alas! the first act of my
administration was unlucky, and
showed that my brains were not
equal to the organization of an Irish
regiment.</p>

<p>Having learned from the chaplain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
that the recruits of different provinces
mutually entertained profound jealousy,
I thought I would succeed well
in putting all the Dublin men in
one company and all the Kerry men
in another. This disposition having
been made, I assigned to each of
the companies one or more apartments
of the barracks, and ordered
them to take immediate possession
of their quarters.</p>

<p>This order, simple in appearance,
was the occasion of a prodigious
storm; and you would be long divining
its cause.</p>

<p>While the Dublin men executed
my order without delay and betook
themselves quietly to their quarters
on the upper story, the Kerry men,
on the contrary, gathered in several
noisy groups under the conduct of as
many leaders, as if they did not understand
the orders, and finally declared
point blank that they would
not obey them.</p>

<p>"Peste, Monsieur l'Aumonier,"
said I to the chaplain, who observed
with a certain anxiety the disturbance
which was brewing, "if things
begin thus, they do not augur well
for the future."</p>

<p>"Wait a bit, captain, before dealing
harshly with the culpable. Let me
find out the motives of their resistance."</p>

<p>"All right, father. I await your
rendering an account of them."</p>

<p>The monk stepped firmly up to
the mutineers and endeavored to
speak with them.</p>

<p>"We want the upper floor! We'll
have the top floor!" was the only answer
he received.</p>

<p>"But, boys, the upper floor is no
better than the lower."</p>

<p>"We want the upper! The Kerry
lads are not made to be stowed away
on the ground-floor."</p>

<p>"For mercy's sake, listen to reason,
or else the captain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Down wid Dublin! Kerry for
ever!"</p>

<p>The monk returned, pale as death,
to explain the cause of the tumult.</p>

<p>The volunteers from "county Kerry,"
whose blood is proverbially
warm, were indignant because I had
quartered them on the ground-floor,
while the Dublin lads occupied the
upper story; wherefore they were determined
not to budge until this insult
was repaired and Kerry vindicated.</p>

<p>"But, reverend father, the order is
given, and cannot be revoked without
compromising my dignity. Try to
point out to me the leaders; I will
have them arrested. As to the
others&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! captain, remember their inexperience
of discipline."</p>

<p>"That is the very reason why I
wish to be severe with the leaders."</p>

<p>I had the leaders of the disturbance
arrested, and, on seeing this,
the remainder quietly dispersed and
occupied without further difficulty
their allotted barracks.</p>

<p>"Boys," said I, going among
them, "the leaders who have brought
you astray are scoundrels, whom I
am going to punish. They have
trifled wickedly with that proud sentiment
of rivalry which does honor
to the different provinces of Ireland.
Keep this sentiment of noble jealousy,
of just emulation, keep it for
the field of battle, where you can
make better use of it than here."</p>

<p>"Hurrah for the pope! hurrah for
the chaplain! hurrah for the captain!"</p>

<p>A few days later, on a beautiful
afternoon in June, the detachment
of volunteers from Limerick arrived.
They numbered about two hundred,
conducted like the others by their
chaplain, a man at once indefatigable
and full of courage, whose almost
juvenile ardor was irresistibly communicated
to his companions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>I thought that these brave men,
fatigued by a long journey and numerous
privations, deserved to be
well treated by that pope to whom
they came thus to offer their arms
and blood. Hence, I had prepared
for them at the barracks fresh straw
mattresses and warm soup, and, having
made these arrangements, went
forward to meet them on the road to
Ancona.</p>

<p>Confused cries and sounding hurrahs
soon announced the approach of
the column. I presented myself to
the new almoner, whom I recognized
by his long black coat and high gaiters.
At once he gave a prodigious
hurrah for the pope, which was instantly
repeated by the two hundred
volunteers with an enthusiasm of
which the pure races are alone capable.
At the same time they brandished
enormous cudgels, which served
them alike as walking-sticks and
weapons, and with which each man
had provided himself before quitting
his native parish.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to portray the
terror which such scenes produced on
the peaceful inhabitants of the town,
little accustomed to such noisy demonstrations.
They always avoided
meeting the <i>Ollandesi</i>, as they then
ignorantly termed them&mdash;the <i>Verdoni</i>,
(canary color, half green and half yellow,)
as they afterward called them,
from the colors of their uniform.
The women were content to gaze
timidly from the windows at these
strange guests; the urchins alone,
braver or more frolicsome, escorted
the newly-arrived, and strove to keep
step with these giants of the north,
four times as great as themselves.</p>

<p>During the bombardment of Ancona,
which lasted six days, I occupied
with the fourth Irish company a
bastion of the intrenched camp,
situated on a height which commanded
the city and the defence from the
land side. For some days we
had nothing to shelter us; and to
add to the annoyance, the earth
having been lately turned for the
works ordered by the general, the
first rain changed it to thick mud.
On this couch my men had to sleep,
with naught above them save the
arch of heaven. Nevertheless, they
did not complain, as I might have
expected from their previous conduct,
and they remained the whole
night exposed to a driving rain on
this wet soil without uttering one
complaint, so much had the sight of
the enemy excited their ardor and
developed their military virtues.
Strange! It had only required a few
bomb-shells to change these peasants,
so untractable the evening before,
into sober, patient, and warlike soldiers,
ready for all sacrifices. Every
afternoon, about five o'clock, the bombardment
ceased, as if by agreement,
and then commenced the most original
scene which can be imagined.</p>

<p>In the midst of the terreplein of
my bastion they kindled a fire, and
grouped themselves pell-mell around
it, just as chance arranged them, soldiers,
non-commissioned and commissioned
officers. For the latter seats
of honor were reserved, consisting
principally of inverted wheel-barrows,
water-buckets, and old pieces of lumber.
The pipes struck up, the gourds
of brandy passed from hand to hand,
and tongues were unloosed; and as
the day had been more or less exciting,
so was the conversation animated.
One of a dramatic turn, endowed
with a long and neglected beard and
draped majestically in some old cloak,
recited with upraised hands some
scene of mighty Shakespeare. Another,
somewhat younger, sung tenderly
a national air, a sweet melody
of the poet Moore. I have always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
remembered one of these touching
ballads, and cannot resist giving it
here:</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Rich and rare were the gems she wore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a bright gold ring on her wand she bore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But oh! her beauty was far beyond<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her sparkling gems or snow-white wand.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Lady, dost thou not fear to stray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So lone and lovely, through this bleak way?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are Erin's sons so good or so cold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As not to be tempted by woman or gold?'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Sir knight! I feel not the least alarm;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No son of Erin will offer me harm;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For though they love woman and golden store,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sir knight, they love honor and virtue more!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"On she went, and her maiden smile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In safety lighted her round the green isle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blest for ever is she who relied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Erin's honor and Erin's pride."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another, an inhabitant of the
mountains, began some interminable
legend, in which the ghosts of his ancestors
played an important part.
Sighs and cries of joy accompanied
the recital, broken only by the monotonous
"All's well," which the sentries
on the parapet passed from one
end of the camp to the other. All
listened, awed, wonder-stricken, and
transported in spirit to the hearths
which they had left, and around which
they had often kept joyous vigil by
the light of the burning turf. Fortunately,
no inopportune shell came
from the enemy's batteries to cast its
lurid glare over the joyous group or
glitter on the beard of the singer.
O pure and romantic natures! Oh!
what a natural poesy and gayety surrounds
this race, which we are wont
to cover with a cloud of melancholy
sadness. Were I to live a hundred
years, I could not efface the vivid remembrance
of those noisy vigils at
Bastion No. 8, at the bombardment
of Ancona in 1860.</p>

<p>Momentary enthusiasm was their
great motive power. Whoever knew
how to excite them, could obtain
from them whatever he wished.
And then, to see the play of their
chests, their arms and shoulders;
they seemed like so many Vulcans.
The heaviest weights, which an Italian
could scarcely move, gun-carriages,
shell, beams, blocks of stone,
they raised without difficulty, and,
placing them on their stalwart shoulders,
carried them with the greatest
ease, one after another. From this
I derived much benefit in a critical
situation.</p>

<p>The Piedmontese having, half by
surprise and half by main force, seized
one of the outposts of Monte Pelago,
and having there posted a battery,
whence a raking fire entirely commanded
the bastion which I occupied,
I saw that, in order to protect
my men, I must construct a traverse
in the midst of the bastion. But how
remove the earth? How perform all
the necessary work under the fire
whose balls rained among us and
whistled unpleasantly in our ears?
Fortune favored me; a heavy rain
storm interrupted the bombardment.</p>

<p>"To work, boys! to work!" I cried.
"In three hours you must raise twelve
feet in length of a traverse, eight feet
high, five feet thick at the top, and
ten at the bottom, which will withstand
every thing they may send from
Monte Pelago. Here, you terrace-makers,
come on with your picks
and shovels. And you, Sergeant
Tongue&mdash;you are a master carpenter;
dress these logs and slabs for me, to
make a frame for the work. In this
manner, by God's grace, we will get
ready a traverse that would keep the
devil out, even if we had not the
Pope with us. To work, boys! to
work!"</p>

<p>In a few hours we had the bastion
sheltered from the fire of the enemy.
Alas! my poor traverse, fruit of such
generous labor, we did not keep you
long. In fact, the following day all
was over, unfortunately ended; Bastion
No. 8, along with all the others,
passed into the hands of the enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>I did not take part in the defence
of Spoleto, that feat of arms so glorious
for the Irish Legion; but after
seeing these volunteers at the bombardment
of Ancona, I can easily imagine
what must have been that struggle
of twenty-four hours of their two
companies against ten thousand Piedmontese.</p>

<p>An old cannon of heavy calibre,
for many years laid aside as condemned,
was buried in a corner of
the fortress. Instantly it was extricated
from the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i>, transported by
main force to a height whence it
commanded the enemy, and mounted
on a gun-carriage; and the rusty old
piece, astonished at its resurrection,
killed more men on that one day
than during the entire century of its
past existence.</p>

<p>A decayed, half-ruined gate afforded
an entrance into the citadel. The
enemy directed their efforts against
it. The athletic sons of St. Patrick
fell to work, and in an hour it was
braced up and barricaded with gabions,
and firmly resisted two successive
assaults of the enemy's column.</p>

<p>I could cite twenty instances of
this kind, where heroic courage joined
to prodigious muscular strength
worked miracles. But if a more prosaic
example will suffice to form an
idea of the strength of these iron
limbs, I would add, softly and not
without a slight blush, that during
the period of my command I never
saw a guard-house door which could
resist their opposing efforts more than
two hours, however well bolted it
might be. After the iniquitous bombardment,
which did not respect the
white flag floating over all the works
of the citadel and fort, our general
capitulated, and we were obliged to
abandon the place. The departure
was very trying, and I cannot recall
without grief the humiliation of that
disastrous day. I do not wish to
speak of it, nor could I do so without
bitter tears; but it gives me pleasure
to remember a spirited act of the
Irish Legion.</p>

<p>It was six o'clock in the evening;
our companies, of which I commanded
the last, marched in close column,
flanked, alas! by a line of Piedmontese,
who, I must admit, had more
regard for our misfortune than the
dastardly population of the city.
We passed gloomily the gate which
leads to the Porta Pia, quickening
our step as much as the escort would
allow, when some of my men came
to me. "Captain," said they, "we
have come to say that Ireland will
blush for her children if she learns
that we abandoned this city without
bidding a last adieu to the pope; we
ask permission to salute him after
our fashion at this last moment."</p>

<p>"I understand; be quiet for a moment,
and Ireland will be content
with you and with me."</p>

<p>A few moments after this, we
reached the boundary of the suburbs.
As the last man passed the gates of
this unfortunate city, judging the moment
opportune for the execution of
our project, I gave with all the
strength of my voice a last hurrah.</p>

<p>"Hurrah for the pope!" shouted
all in unison. The walls, the city,
the gate, even the ocean itself, were
shaken. To paint the astonishment
of our guards would be impossible.
They consulted together for an explanation
of what had just occurred.
Finally, I heard a sous-officer say to
his neighbor,</p>

<p>"<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lasiamo fare, sono Irlandesi!</i>
Bah! these are Irishmen; of what use
is it to trouble yourselves about their
savage cries?"</p>

<p>Such was our departure from Ancona,
on the 29th of September, 1860,
and such the solemn adieu of the
Irish Legion to the pontifical soil.</p>

<h2>NEW PUBLICATIONS.</h2>


<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">The Literature of the Age of
Elizabeth.</span> By Edwin P. Whipple.
Boston: Fields, Osgood &amp; Co. 1869.</p>

<p>The volume of essays bearing this
title is a contribution to our critical
literature by a writer who is, perhaps,
the best of American critics. If "to
see things as they really are" is, as
Matthew Arnold says, the end and office
of true criticism, Mr. Whipple, we
think, is in literary matters fairly entitled
to the distinction we have mentioned;
and although we are far from having
in this country such critics as Taine, or
St. Beuve, or even Arnold himself, it is
one which, in these days of improved
and improving literary taste among Americans,
is real and desirable.</p>

<p>The essays in the present volume,
written originally to be delivered as lectures
before the Lowell Institute, and
then published during the years 1867
and 1868 in the <cite>Atlantic Monthly</cite>, are
upon those subjects in which he is most
at home, and appears always at his best.
He is an enthusiastic and thoroughly
appreciative student of English literature,
and though, as the authors and the
works which form the topics of these
essays have been long ago thoroughly
discussed by such critics as Lamb, Hazlitt,
and Leigh Hunt, the critical scholar
will find but little strikingly new in the
book, he cannot fail to derive pleasure
and profit from many things in it which
are preëminently suggestive, and from
the greater clearness and precision which
many of his previous ideas will gather.</p>

<p>The most striking characteristic of
Mr. Whipple in these essays is the
masterly manner in which he connects
the work with the author. He deals
less with words than with things; less
even with ideas than with mind. He
presents to us especially the mental characteristics,
the habits of thought and
feeling&mdash;in a word, the inner self of the
author of whom he is treating. From a
careful study of the works he has traced
the man, and he gives us now the result;
and using the works for illustration
and proof, asks us if they are not the
expression of the individual character
which he has drawn. Thus, it is the
arrogant and conceited Jonson, the
bitter and misanthropic Marston, the
"one-souled, myriad-minded" Shakespeare,
rather than arrogance, misanthropy,
or universality in their writings,
that he portrays by his criticism.</p>

<p>The book manifests also Mr. Whipple's
usual independence, which prevents
him from becoming the slavish
admirer of any author, however great,
and his innate love of moral purity,
which he shows especially in his criticisms
upon the dramatists.</p>

<p>Its style is marked by that wonderful
control of language and facility of expression
for which Mr. Whipple has
always been distinguished. But we
think it bears evidence of the object for
which the essays were originally prepared&mdash;delivery
as popular lectures.
Such a sentence as we give below seems
to us to detract from the dignity of style
which we might rightfully expect in the
author. Referring to Jonson's brief
occupation as a mason, Mr. Whipple
says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We have no means of deciding whether
or not Ben was foolish enough to look upon
his trade as degrading; that it was distasteful
we know, from the fact that he soon exchanged
the trowel for the sword, and we
hear no more of his dealing with bricks, if
we may except his questionable habit of carrying
too many in his hat."</p></blockquote>

<p>Such things as this, which occur more
or less frequently throughout the book,
might have been advantageously omitted
when Mr. Whipple transferred his essays
from the judgment of a mixed audience
at a lecture-hall, to that of the readers
of a book which will be likely to find its
way only into the hands of those who
are interested in its subject. But, as a
general rule, he uses allusions and anecdotes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
appositely and well, and gains
much sprightliness and vivacity in treating
of subjects which might otherwise
appear somewhat dull to the general
reader by witty and humorous illustrations.</p>

<p>He has also shown a singular felicity
of expression in many phrases and
figures which seem to embody the result
of a careful study of the author, and by
them he often succeeds in conveying in
one condensed and vivid sentence more
of the essential idea of his criticism
than he could have done in pages of
elaborate discussion. Thus, speaking
of Jonson's tragedies, he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"They seem written with his fist."</p></blockquote>

<p>Of Chapman he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Often we feel his meaning rather than
apprehend it. The imagery has the indefiniteness
of distant objects seen by moonlight."</p></blockquote>

<p>And of Spenser:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In truth, the combining, coördinating,
centralizing, fusing imagination of the highest
order of genius&mdash;an imagination competent
to seize and hold such a complex design
as our poet contemplated, and to flash
in brief and burning words details over
which his description lovingly lingers&mdash;this
was a power denied to Spenser. <i>He
has auroral lights in profusion, but no lightning.</i>"</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Whipple's work seems to us more
peculiarly valuable in the discussion of
the minor dramatists and poets of the
time&mdash;authors who are comparatively
unknown to the general mass of readers.
But these writers are neglected only on
account of the great wealth of genius in
which the age abounded. Their real
brilliancy appears only as darkness by
the side of the overpowering light of
Shakespeare and Jonson, Spenser and
Bacon. We hope that many will be induced
by this book to cultivate an acquaintance
with the works of the men
of whom it treats, and we have the more
expectation that this will be so from the
fact that not its least praiseworthy characteristic
is the care and good taste
with which the extracts from these
authors, by which Mr. Whipple illustrates
his criticisms, have been made.
We can only regret that they have been
so sparingly introduced.</p>

<p>The author's treatment and discussion
of Bacon's genius, and his claim to be
the founder of the inductive philosophy,
are unsatisfactory to our mind; but this
subject involves a question into which
it is impossible to enter in this notice.</p>

<p>We regret that we cannot take leave
of this pleasant and on the whole admirable
book without being obliged to
say, that though it is by no means dangerous,
it is often annoying to the Catholic
reader. Mr. Whipple seems to be imbued
with that prejudice and unfairness
which is so common in English and
American literature when alluding to
the church, and in several places by
slight words and phrases expresses that
sneering contempt in which authors of
his "liberal and tolerant" views are so
apt to indulge toward those who differ
from them in belief. We think, too,
that in his introductory chapter he gives
altogether too much prominence to the
"Reformation" as a means of intellectual
awakening. The so-called Reformation
may indeed have been partially, and in a
peculiar sense, a <em>result</em> of the intellectual
ferment of the time&mdash;an unhappy
and deplorable result&mdash;but it was not one
of its <em>causes</em>, as the author seems to
think. Those lie further back, in those
other great events which Mr. Whipple
names&mdash;the revival of classical learning,
the invention of printing, and the
discovery of America; events which he
and his class of writers would do well
often to remind themselves were brought
about by loyal and devout Catholics.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">The writings of Madame Swetchine.</span>
Edited by Count de Falloux of
the French Academy. Translated by
H. W. Preston. New York: The
Catholic Publication Society, 126
Nassau street. 1869.</p>

<p><i>The Life and Letters of Madame
Swetchine</i>, published some eighteen
months since, might dispense us from any
more special mention of her <i>Writings</i>
than to say that she is in both works
well and eloquently portrayed as a
character "destined to hold a front place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
among the most powerful, original, pure,
and fascinating revealed in all history."</p>

<p>Madame Swetchine was of aristocratic
birth, very wealthy, accomplished,
and even learned. Better than all these,
she was liberal in ideas, the friend of the
poor and lowly, modest, humble, and
pious. The greatest minds of the age&mdash;De
Maistre, De Bonald, Cuvier, Frayssinous,
De Falloux, De Broglie, Lacordaire,
and Montalembert&mdash;sought her
friendship and hung upon her words.
And yet even such homage as this
never inspired her with the slightest
literary vanity or worldly ambition.
She wrote much, but never for publication.
She never specially preserved
what she wrote, never desired to.
The material of the book before us,
collected after her death by her executor,
Count de Falloux, of the French
Academy, was written without any
fixed plan, at various periods, upon
loose leaves in a rapid, illegible hand,
most of it in pencil. The manuscript
was distributed among several of her
literary friends, with whom it was a
labor of love to arrange and prepare it
for the press.</p>

<p>Rarely has unpublished writing had
so bright a constellation of posthumous
interpreters. The "Thoughts" are arranged
by the Abbé de Cazalès and
Count Jules de Berton; "Old Age," by
Count Paul Resseguier; "Resignation,"
by Count Albert De Resseguier and
Prince A. Galitzin.</p>

<p>The general title "Writings" is eminently
proper here, as Madame Swetchine
never entertained the premeditation
implied by the term "works." They
are marked by a knowledge of the world,
a philosophical range of thought, a
purity of soul, and an elevation of piety
rarely united in one person. Here are
a few of her scattered "Thoughts,"
which we take almost at random:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Loyalty is patriotism simplified."</p>

<p>"I like people to be saints; but I want
them to be first, and superlatively, honest
men."</p>

<p>"The root of sanctity is sanity. A man
must be healthy before he can be holy. We
bathe first, and then perfume."</p>

<p>"We forgive too little&mdash;forget too much."</p>

<p>"Good is slow; it climbs. Evil is swift;
it descends. Why should we marvel that
it makes great progress in a short time?"</p>

<p>"We must labor unceasingly to render
our piety reasonable, and our reason pious."</p>

<p>"Years do not make sages; they only
make old men."</p>

<p>"Antiquity is a species of aristocracy with
which it is not easy to be on visiting terms."</p>

<p>"The choicest of the public are not always
the public choice."</p>

<p>"The inventory of my faith for this lower
world is soon made out. I believe in Him
who made it."</p>

<p>"I allow the Catholic only one right;
that, namely, of being a better man than
others."</p>

<p>"Only those faults which we encounter
in ourselves are insufferable to us in others."</p>

<p>"A vast number of attachments subsist
on the common hatred of a third person."</p></blockquote>

<p>The treatise on old age is a classic
Christian <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Senectute</i>, with an elevation
and morality impossible to Cicero.</p>

<p>The <i>Airelles</i> (flowers that ripen under
the snow) are a series of beautiful reflections,
as remarkable for their strength
as for their delicacy. They are utterances
which sprang from Madame
Swetchine's own heart, but reached no
other; impressions which clothed themselves
in images to people her solitude.
Here are a few which we select with
hesitation, as we must necessarily confine
our choice to the shortest:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"To have ideas is to gather flowers. To
think is to weave them into garlands."</p>

<p>"Our vanity is the constant enemy of our
dignity."</p>

<p>"The chains which cramp us most are
those which weigh on us least."</p>

<p>"O widow's mite! why hast thou not,
in human balances, the immense weight
which celestial pity accords thee?"</p>

<p>"Travel is the frivolous part of serious
lives, and the serious part of frivolous ones."</p>

<p>"We are always looking into the future,
but we see only the past."</p>

<p>"We are often prophets to others only
because we are our own historians."</p>

<p>"We are early struck by bold conceptions
and brilliant thoughts; later, we learn to
appreciate natural grace and the charm of
simplicity. In early youth, we are hardly
sensible of any but very lively emotions.
All that is not dazzling appears dull; all
that is not affecting, cold. Conspicuous
beauties overshadow those which must be
sought; and the mind, in its haste to enjoy,
demands facile pleasures. Ripe age inspires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
us with other thoughts. We retrace our
steps; taste critically what, before, we devoured;
study, and make discoveries; and
the ray of light, decomposed under our
hands, yields a thousand shades for one
color."</p>

<p>"Slavery, for example. Christianity has
no need to ordain its abolition&mdash;it inspires
it; and that is enough for the man who
would be governed by the spirit of Christ.
It is the imperfect reception of Christianity
in the soul which allows slavery to continue;
and truth has made no progress unless human
bondage has been rendered impossible
by its advance. To combat slavery solely
from a philanthropic point of view, is too
often to lose one's labor, for lust and cupidity
mount guard over the system; but to
encourage, develop, and stimulate the moral
element most antagonistic to human bondage
is to accelerate the chances of emancipation,
and to multiply them a hundred-fold."</p></blockquote>

<p>There are various other chapters, comprising
a remarkable range of subjects&mdash;on
the soul, the intellect, on nature,
courtesy, music, the fine arts, on resignation,
the world, the affections, etc.</p>

<p>The translation is well executed by
Miss Harriet W. Preston, and the typography
and paper are excellent.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Catholic Doctrine, as defined by
the Council of Trent, expounded
in a Series of Conferences,
delivered in Geneva.</span> By the
Rev. A. Nampon, S.J. Proposed as
a means of reuniting all Christians.
Translated from the French, with the
approbation of the author, by a member
of the University of Oxford.
Philadelphia: Peter F. Cunningham.
1869.</p>

<p>We know of no work recently issued
by the American Catholic press whose
appearance we more cordially welcome
than this of Father Nampon's, <i>Catholic
Doctrine, as defined by the Council of
Trent</i>. It is truly a book for the times;
and we unite with the most Rev. Archbishop
of Baltimore, whose approbation,
together with that of the Archbishops
of New York and Cincinnati, and of the
Bishop of Philadelphia, it bears, in expressing
the conviction that "it is well
calculated to do a great amount of good,"
and the "hope that it may be extensively
circulated." When the illustrious Bossuet
gave to the world his incomparable
work on Catholic doctrine in contrast
with "Protestant Variations," Protestantism
was but in its seed-time; and
the harvest of errors, which it has
since so abundantly brought forth, had
scarcely begun to show itself. Since
then, to use the words of the author of the
book before us, "How many new variations
and divisions have appeared among
Protestants! What ruins has the explosion
of rationalism scattered on that
desolated plain! And what weakness
has been produced in that which yet remains
among them of Christian belief!
How many doctrines, at that time respected,
are now thrown aside with contempt
in the exercise of private judgment!
How much has the authority of
Scripture been shaken! To what an
extent have the sublime mysteries of the
Trinity, the Incarnation, and, indeed,
all mystery, all notions of the supernatural,
become, in the eyes of an ever-increasing
number of those who heretofore
were Christians, superannuated, absurd,
mythological ideas!"</p>

<p>But the author of the present volume
does not propose to himself to <em>add</em> to the
work of the great Bossuet&mdash;to be a <em>continuator</em>
of the history of the variations.
He adopts a different method. Translating
and setting before the reader the
definitions and decrees of the sacred
Council of Trent, whose work was called
forth by, and mainly directed against
the errors of the so-called Reformers, or
to which their revolt against the church's
authority had given rise, he first expounds
the true Catholic doctrine impugned
by them, and then contrasts
with it the ever-varying opinions and
fading beliefs which they undertook to
substitute for that doctrine. And this
is done so clearly and eloquently, and
yet so kindly withal, that his book may
be specially commended to the Protestant
reader, as one wherein he will find
Catholic doctrine set forth in its verity,
and Protestant error in its deformity,

or, The Biblical Account of
Man's Creation, Tested by Scientific
Theories of his Origin
and Antiquity.</span> By Joseph P.
Thompson, D.D., LL.D. New-York:
Samuel R. Wells, 389 Broadway.
1870.</p>

<p>This is a short treatise of considerable
value, showing both research and a
power of clear reasoning on the part of
the author. To a very great extent we
concur with his conclusions and opinions,
and altogether in his estimate of
the importance and utility of such investigations.
The student of biblical
science will find his book useful to a
greater extent than its unpretending
size and appearance would indicate;
and its general effect, so far as it is circulated
in the ordinary reading community,
must be wholesome, as furnishing
an antidote to the pseudo-scientific
trash which is such a common article
of intellectual diet in our day. The lack
of a sufficient authority to define what
is revealed with certainty prevents the
author from affirming with due assurance
some revealed verities, such as
the unity of the race, and brings down
his argument too much to a mere balancing
of probabilities, a defect which is
inherent in modern popular theology
and philosophy. He makes also an
over-estimate of the value of material
progress in itself, and its effect on the
sum of human happiness. Like most
Protestant ministers, he is unable to
keep from betraying his uneasiness in
regard to Protestantism by bringing in
the confident but groundless and unproved
assertion that it is the mainspring
of all modern civilization, science,
and progress. Dr. Ewer has fully
shown the fallacy of all such assumptions,
which, at all events, are quite
irrelevant to Genesis and geology, and
would be more appropriately put forth
by the author in his sermons than in
a scientific treatise. There are other
things which are out of keeping with
the solid, scholarly character of the best
portion of the book, betraying haste and
a lack of care and finish in the composition.
With these deductions, we gladly
acknowledge our obligations to the
learned author for a really valuable contribution
to sacred literature.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">A Critique upon Mr. Ffoulkes's
Letter.</span> By H. I. D. Ryder, of the
Oratory. London: Longmans.</p>

<p>Mr. Ffoulkes's unfortunate pamphlet
is completely pulverized by this short,
pithy, and complete reply. Dr. Ward
and F. Bottalla have also performed the
same task, each in his own way, and we
cannot but commiserate any one who
falls into the hands of such a trio. We
look upon Mr. Ffoulkes as a man who
has some very good points, and who has
shown a temper of mind and heart inclining
us to judge his mistakes very
leniently. His pamphlet is tedious,
crude, inconsistent, and utterly without
any logical or historical basis. It is,
nevertheless, a fair reflex of the state of
mind in which many Anglicans are at
present detained, so that it is well calculated
to do a great amount of mischief.
Refutations of it are, therefore, not a
superfluous work, but a very useful one.
We are glad that F. Ryder has answered
Mr. Ffoulkes, for the reason above
given; but, apart from this, we are glad
to see any thing on theological topics
from his pen. In our opinion he has
shown more of the true genius of theology
than any other of the rising young
authors in the Catholic Church of England,
except, perhaps, Fr. Bottalla, who
is without his equal in his manner of
handling the controversy respecting the
papal supremacy. F. Ryder is a deep
student in certain departments of theology
which lie below the surface presented
in the common text-books; he
is uncommonly discriminating and judicious,
and possesses a fine tact which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
enables him to feel the seat and nature
of the errors and misconceptions in the
English mind most in need of skilful
handling. We hope, therefore, that his
pen may be employed as frequently
as possible on theological topics.</p>

<p>This is a most interesting work, and
is one of the volumes of the "Illustrated

of which have been noticed in our pages.
The information given in this little book
about insects and animals is highly interesting,
and if heeded there would be
less need of "societies for the protection
of animals." In the preface, the author
very justly remarks that "The marvels
of animal intelligence claim now more
than ever the attention of observers.
Without admitting, like some people,
that we came from a quadruped; without
approving the beast-worship of the
Egyptians; we believe that most animals
which crawl or walk on the earth,
or fly in the air, form communities like
ourselves. We believe that the lower
animals possess, in a certain degree, the
faculties of man, and that our inferior
brothers, as St. Francis of Assisi calls
them, preceded us on earth." The
illustrations are good, and <i>apropos</i> to
the subjects.</p>

<p class="center">"Render, therefore, to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's; and to God the things that
are God's"&mdash;<span class="smcap">St. Matt.</span> xxii 21.</p>


<p>The Pharisees endeavored to entrap
our blessed Lord by a dilemma
which would force him to present his
doctrine under a false and untenable
issue, whichever side of it he might
take. He overcame their cunning
by a superior wisdom which reduced
them to silence and covered them
with shame. In a precisely similar
manner the enemies of the church
are perpetually endeavoring to force
upon her some false issue, with equally
signal ill success. The Pharisees presented
the rights of God and the
rights of Cæsar as two contrary, antagonistic
sides of a dilemma, one of
which must be chosen to the exclusion
of the other, and either one of
which would be fatal to the cause of
Jesus Christ. The modern enemies
of the church place religion in opposition
to reason, faith to science,
grace to nature, liberty to authority,
as if these were contrary and antagonistic
to each other. They require
us to choose between them. If we
choose the first set of principles, they
expect to ruin our cause by simply
showing its opposition to the second
set; if we choose the second set of
principles, they expect an equally easy
victory, because in that case religion
and the church become unnecessary.
The church will not, however, permit
herself to be placed in any such false
position. She will not choose between
religion and reason, faith and
science, grace and nature, authority
and liberty, but she will embrace and
reconcile them all, giving to each one
of them all that is justly due to it.</p>

<p>At the present moment, when the
pope has summoned an &oelig;cumenical
council, the influence of which upon
the world is dreaded by anti-Catholics
and some nominally Catholic statesmen,
the cry has become unusually
loud and alarming that the church
is assuming an aggressive attitude
against science, civilization, the rights
of the state, religious and political
liberty. What! the church aggressive,
her attitude dangerous? It is
not long since you all said she was
an effete institution, an affair of past
ages, totally dead! Now it seems
you have suddenly become afraid of
her aggressions, and are alarmed lest
she should swallow up all modern society.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
You no longer affect to pity
her feebleness, but you exclaim against
her audacity. Undoubtedly, the convocation
of an &oelig;cumenical council by
Pius IX. was a very bold act. When
you consider his advanced age of
nearly eighty years, the critical state
of Europe, the vastness and complication
of the questions and interests
upon which a council must deliberate,
and other circumstances well known
to you all, which I need not specially
enumerate, the act of the pope may
very properly be characterized as one
of the boldest steps which has ever
been taken by any sovereign ruler.</p>

<p>Yet, in the light of the Catholic
faith, so far from being such a very
bold act, it appears like the most
natural and the safest thing which
he could possibly do. The Catholic
faith teaches that the church founded
upon the rock of Peter is infallible,
by the promise and perpetual presence
of Christ, the continual, inamissible
indwelling of the Holy
Spirit. In an &oelig;cumenical council,
where the universal episcopate is
gathered together under the presidency
of its head, the successor of Peter,
as vicar of Christ, the Catholic
Church is organized for deliberation
and action in the most perfect way
possible. Who compose a council?
The bishops of the world, to whom
the right of membership belongs by
divine law, and other prelates in eminent
positions to whom the privilege
is conceded by ecclesiastical law.
Among them are men of distinct
races, of different nations and languages,
and governing dioceses or
missions in all the different quarters
and regions of the globe. The most
learned and able men of the Catholic
Church, the men who are most experienced
in affairs and most intimately
connected with the great political interests
of the world, the men who
have made the greatest sacrifices and
performed the most important labors
in the cause of God, are to be found
among them. It is a world-congress
of men in every intellectual and
moral respect the most venerable
that could possibly be collected on
the earth; without comparison superior
to any other deliberative or legislative
assembly. An &oelig;cumenical
council is, as the church teaches and
every Catholic is bound to believe,
infallibly directed and assisted by the
Holy Spirit. Its decisions are to be
received as proceeding from the
mouth of God, its definitions of faith
are final, unerring, and unchangeable.
It is impossible, therefore, to imagine
a greater absurdity, a more palpable
contradiction, than that of appealing
from an &oelig;cumenical council to Jesus
Christ while professing to continue a
member of the Catholic Church. It
is appealing from the Holy Spirit to
the Son; and, to carry out the absurdity
to its utmost length, we have
only to suppose one appealing from
the Son to the Father Almighty.
The god who is really appealed to
in such a case is the idol of self in
the bosom of the individual.</p>

<p>The question which is so frequently
and anxiously asked, What, then,
will the council do? has already been
answered by anticipation in what I
have just said, so far as it can be answered,
at the present time, or need
be answered, to reassure every good
Catholic. The council will do whatsoever
the Holy Ghost dictates.
Further than this we cannot say any
thing positively. But we can say
very distinctly and certainly, what
the council will <em>not</em> do. If it were
to be an assembly of Protestant divines,
guided each one by his private
light, or of Swedenborgians, Spiritists,
or Mormons, something <i>piquant</i> might
be expected in the line of new doctrines
or new revelations. But since
it is a Catholic council, there will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
no new revelations or new doctrines
proclaimed. The church has no
mission or authority to add any thing
to the deposit of faith, committed
by our Lord, orally or by inspiration
of the Holy Spirit, to the apostles.
Her office is to guard, to teach, to
protect, and explain the faith. She
decides what Jesus Christ taught to
the apostles, and they to their successors,
according to evidence contained
in Scripture and apostolic tradition,
assisted by the infallible light of the
Holy Spirit. Whatever she defines
as pertaining to Catholic faith has always
been believed in the church.
The council will, therefore, so far as
relates to faith, proclaim no new doctrines,
but merely explain, so far as
necessary, the ancient faith as it is opposed
to the errors of the day, and
declare in a more precise and explicit
manner that which is really contained
in the divine revelation, and, therefore,
always implicitly believed by
every Catholic.</p>

<p>In respect to discipline, the church
has no power to alter any divine
laws; but she has power over her
own laws, to add to them, to amend,
modify, or abrogate them. In matters
of variable discipline, the council
will, therefore, consider how far any
new legislation is necessary and expedient,
will make such enactments as
it shall deem best, and these will become
part of the supreme, universal
law of the church, binding on the
conscience of all its members.</p>

<p>But it is objected, and even some
ill-informed or disaffected Catholics
are found to join in the cry, the
Roman court will prevail in the council,
the bishops will not be free to
discuss or decide any thing; for every
thing has already been determined
by the pope, who will impose his will
as law upon the council. Be it so!
All I have to say, then, is that, if the
Roman court prevail, it is the Holy
Ghost who prevails through the
Roman court. Those who use such
language know but little of the real
state of things at the Roman court,
or of the character of the prelates
who will compose the council. In
regard to the Roman court, I can
speak from my own personal knowledge
and experience. There is no
sovereign on earth toward whom so
much freedom of speech is used, by
those whose position and character
qualify them to give him advice, as
the sovereign pontiff. There is no
place where there is so much freedom
of opinion and discussion as Rome.
The former councils, and especially
that of Trent, show how great is the
freedom of debate, and how thorough
the discussion of topics which prevails
in these august assemblies. I will
speak of but one instance, that of the
Archbishop of Braga, at Trent, who
insisted in the most pointed manner
on the obligation which rested on the
most illustrious cardinals to set the
example to the rest of the faithful, of
"a most illustrious reform." So far
from giving offence at Rome, the
freedom of this holy prelate caused
him to be treated by the pope with
the most distinguished consideration,
and honored by marks of the warmest
friendship. The prelates who will
compose the council of the Vatican
are not men who can be either allured
or terrified by any human or worldly
motives into any action contrary to
their consciences or their convictions.</p>

<p>But the pope has already in his
recent encyclical and syllabus, with
the acquiescence of the great body
of Catholic bishops, condemned
science, progress, civilization, and
liberty.</p>

<p>What is the authority on which this
assertion is made? The newspapers.
The <em>newspapers</em>! Who would not
be ashamed to cite such an authority
on such a subject. Newspaper articles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
written, as some of them openly confess,
chiefly with a view of making a
sensation, by persons destitute of the
proper information for speaking intelligently
on ecclesiastical matters,
and too frequently not of a disposition
to tell the truth if they knew it. To
place faith in opposition to science is
a patent absurdity, for it is the same
as opposing truth to truth. And there
is no person upon whom the charge
of maintaining such an absurdity can
be fastened with less justice than
Pius IX. There is no pontiff who
has appeared to take such an especial
pride and delight in maintaining by
his decisions and by the magnificent
language of his pontifical letters the
dignity and the rights of human reason
as he has, a fact which I could
easily prove by citations, if the time
permitted. But let us know what
those persons who charge the syllabus
with opposing science, signify by
that term. If they mean by it the
theories of sophists like Humboldt,
Huxley, Comte, Mill, Spencer, and
certain philosophers of Boston, who
dethrone God, deify matter, degrade
the rational and spiritual nature of
man, and reduce all knowledge to a
chaos of scepticism, the pope and the
church are opposed to all such science
as that. Whoever upholds it is certainly
fully authorized to apply to
himself the definition which his favorite
philosophy gives of man; to wit,
that he is nothing more than <i>a finely
organized ape</i>.</p>

<p>What do they mean by progress
and civilization? Is it the supremacy
of material interests, the dictatorial
control of the state over education,
the doctrine that the chief end
of man is to establish railways and
telegraphic lines? Then the church
is opposed to them. But to call her
the enemy of civilization in the true,
genuine sense of the word, is not only
false, but the basest ingratitude on
the part of those to whom she has
given that inheritance of civilization
on which all the nations of Christendom
are at this moment living.</p>

<p>What do they mean by liberty?
Freedom from all religion, from all
moral restraints, from the bonds and
obligations of marriage, the subjection
of the church to the power of
civil rulers, and the atheistic constitution
of the political and social state?
To all these the church is opposed,
and these she will resist to the last
drop of her blood. And so are you
opposed to them, if you have the sentiments
of a man or make any pretension
to the name of a Christian.
So are the wisest and most virtuous
of those who are out of the communion
of the church, by whatever name
they may choose to be designated.
Such false liberalism as this we all
alike detest, and must oppose with
all our strength; for it is destructive
of that only true liberty which we
prize above all things&mdash;the "<i>liberty
of the children of God</i>."</p>

<p>I have thought it necessary, my
dear brethren&mdash;I may say my beloved
children in Christ, for I am your pastor&mdash;to
present before you these considerations
on the eve of my departure
to attend the &OElig;cumenical Council.</p>

<p>It is not that you have need to be
taught these things&mdash;for you are believing
and instructed Catholics&mdash;that
I have presented them before you;
but that you may better understand
what great benefits and blessings we
may expect to flow from the deliberations
and acts of that great council
which is about to assemble, the most
numerous and the most important
which has been seen in the church
for centuries. I desire you to look
forward, as I do, to a new and glorious
era in the church's history, an
era of the triumph of faith and holiness,
in which I trust our own country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
is destined to become the theatre
of a brilliant development of the Catholic
religion. I earnestly recommend
to your prayers the success of
the great work which is before the
council, and my own prosperous return
to you after its close. As I

apostles SS. Peter and Paul, and before
the holy shrines of the saints, I

<h2>ANGELA.</h2>


<h3>CHAPTER VI.<br />

THE ULTRAMONTANE WAY OF THINKING.</h3>

<p>On the following morning no message
was sent for the doctor. The
child had died, as Klingenberg foretold.
Frank thought of the great
affliction of the Siegwart family&mdash;Angela
in tears and the father broken
down with grief. It drove him from
Frankenhöhe. In a quarter of an
hour he was at the house of the proprietor.</p>

<p>A servant came weeping to meet
him.</p>

<p>"You cannot speak to my master,"
said she. "We had a bad
night. My master is almost out of
his mind; he has only just now lain
down. Poor Eliza! the dear, good
child." And the tears burst forth
again.</p>

<p>"When did the child die?"</p>

<p>"At four o'clock this morning; and
how beautiful she still looks in death!
You would think she is only sleeping.
If you wish to see her, just go up to
the same room in which you were
yesterday."</p>

<p>After some hesitation, Frank ascended
the stairs and entered the
room. As he passed the threshold,
he paused, greatly surprised at the
sight that met his view. The room
was darkened, the shutters closed,
and across the room streamed the
broken rays of the morning sun. On
a white-covered table burned wax
candles, in the midst of which stood
a large crucifix; there was also a
holy-water vase, and in it a green
branch. On the white cushions of
the bed reposed Eliza, a crown of
evergreens about her forehead and a
little crucifix in her folded hands.
Her countenance was not the least
disfigured; only about her softly-closed
eyes there was a dark shade,
and the lifelike freshness of the lips
had vanished. Angela sat near the
bed on a low stool; she had laid her
head near that of her sister, and in
consequence of a wakeful night was
fast asleep. Eliza's little head lay in
her arms, and in her hand she held
the same rosary that he had found
near the statue. Frank stood immovable
before the interesting group.</p>

<p>The most beautiful form he had
ever beheld he now saw in close contact
with the dead. Earnest thoughts
passed through his mind. The fleetingness
of all earthly things vividly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
occurred to him. Eliza's corpse reminded
him impressively that her sister,
the charming Angela, must meet
the same inevitable fate. His eyes
rested on the beautiful features of the
sufferer, which were not in the least
disfigured by bitter or gloomy dreams,
and which expressed in sleep the
sweetest peace. She slept as gently
and confidingly near Eliza as if she
did not know the abyss which death
had placed between them. The
only disorder in Angela's external
appearance was the glistening curls
of hair that hung loose over her
shoulders on her breast.</p>

<p>At length Frank departed, with the
determination of returning to make
his visit of condolence. After the
accustomed walk with Klingenberg,
he went immediately back to Siegwart's.</p>

<p>When he returned home, he wrote
in his diary:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"May 21st.&mdash;Surprising and wonderful!</p>

<p>"When my uncle's little Agnes died, my
aunt took ill, and my uncle's condition bordered
on insanity; tortured by excruciating
anguish, he murmured against providence.
He accused God of cruelty and injustice,
because he took from him a child he loved
so much. He lost all self-control, and had
not strength to bear the misfortune with
resignation. And now the Siegwart family
are in the same circumstances; the father
is much broken down, much afflicted, but
very resigned; his trembling lips betray the
affliction that presses on his heart, but they
make no complaints against providence.</p>

<p>"'I thank you for your sympathy,' said
he to me. 'The trial is painful; but God
knows what he does. The Lord gave me
the dear child; the Lord has taken her
away. His holy will be done.' So spoke
Siegwart. While he said this, a perceptible
pain changed his manly countenance, and
he lay like a quivering victim on the altar
of the Lord. Siegwart's wife, a beautiful
woman, with calm, mild eyes, wept inwardly.
Her mother's heart bled from a thousand
wounds; but she showed the same self-control
and resignation as Siegwart did, to the
will of the Most High.</p>

<p>"And Angela? I do not understand her
at all. She speaks of Eliza as of one sleeping,
or of one who has gone to a place
where she is happy. But sometimes a
spasm twitches her features; then her
eyes rest on the crucifix that stands amid
the lighted candles. The contemplation
of the crucifix seems to afford her strength
and vigor. This is a mystery to me. I
cannot conceive the mysterious power of
that carved figure.</p>

<p>"Misery does not depress these people;
it ennobles them. I have never seen the
like. When I compare their conduct with
that of those I have known, I confess that
the Siegwart family puts my acquaintance
as well as myself to shame.</p>

<p>"What gives these people this strength,
this calm, this resignation? Religion, perhaps.
Then religion is infinitely more than
a mere conception, a mere external rule of
faith.</p>

<p>"I am beginning to suspect that between
heaven and earth there exists, for those
who live for heaven, a warm, living union.
It appears to me that Providence does not,
indeed, exempt the faithful from the common
lot of earthly affliction; but he gives
them strength which transcends the power
of human nature.</p>

<p>"I have undertaken the task of putting
Angela to the test, and what do I find?
Admiration for her&mdash;shame for myself; and
also the certainty that my views of women
must be restricted."</p></blockquote>

<p>He had scarcely written down
these thoughts, when he bit impatiently
the pen between his teeth.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We must not be hasty in our judgments,"
he wrote further. "Perhaps it is
my ignorance of the depth of the human
heart that causes me to consider in so favorable
a light the occurrences in the Siegwart
family.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is a kind of stupidity of mind,
an unrefined feeling, a frivolous perception
of fatality, that gives these people this
quiet and resignation. My judgment shall
not be made up. Angela may conceal beneath
the loveliness of her nature characteristics
and failings which may justify my
opinion of the sex, notwithstanding."</p></blockquote>

<p>With a peculiar stubbornness which
struggles to maintain a favorite conviction,
he closed the diary.</p>

<p>On the second day after Eliza's
death the body was consigned to the
earth. Frank followed the diminutive
coffin, which was carried by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
four little girls dressed in white. The
youthful bearers had wreaths of flowers
on their heads and blue silk ribbons
about their waists, the ends of
which hung down.</p>

<p>After these followed a band of girls,
also dressed in white and blue. They
had flowers fixed in their hair, and
in their hands they carried a large
wreath of evergreens and roses. The
whole community followed the procession&mdash;a
proof of the great respect
the proprietor enjoyed among his
neighbors. Siegwart's manner was
quiet, but his eyes were inflamed.
As the coffin was lowered into the
ground, the larks sang in the air, and
the birds in the bushes around joined
their sweet cadences with the not
plaintive but joyful melodies which
were sung by a choir of little girls.
The church ceremonies, like nature,
breathed joy and triumph, much to
Richard's astonishment. He did not
understand how these songs of gladness
and festive costumes could be
reconciled with the open grave. He
believed that the feelings of the
mourners must be hurt by all this.
He remained with the family at the
grave till the little mound was
smoothed and finished above it. The
people scattered over the graveyard,
and knelt praying before the different
graves. The cross was planted on
Eliza's resting-place, and the girls
placed the large wreath on the little
mound. Siegwart spoke words of
consolation to his wife as he conducted
her to the carriage. Angela, sunk
in sadness, still remained weeping at
the grave. Richard approached and
offered her his arm. The carriage
proceeded toward Salingen and stopped
before the church, whose bells
were tolling. The service began.
Again was Richard surprised at the
joyful melody of the church hymns.
The organ pealed forth joyfully as on
a festival. Even the priest at the altar
did not wear black, but white
vestments. Frank, unfamiliar with
the deep spirit of the Catholic liturgy,
could not understand this singular
funeral service.</p>

<p>After service the family returned.
Frank sat opposite to Angela, who
was very sad, but in no way depressed.
He even thought he saw now
and then the light of a peculiar joy
in her countenance. Madame Siegwart
could not succeed in overcoming
her maternal sorrow. Her tears
burst forth anew, and her husband
consoled her with tender words.</p>

<p>Frank strove to divert Angela from
her sad thoughts. As he thought it
would not be in good taste to speak
of ordinary matters, he expressed his
surprise at the manner of the burial.</p>

<p>"Your sister," said he, "was interred
with a solemnity which excited
my surprise, and, I confess, my disapprobation.
Not a single hymn of
sorrow was sung, either at the grave
or in the church. One would not
believe that those white-clad girls
with wreaths of flowers on their heads
were carrying the soulless body of a
beloved being to the grave. The
whole character of the funeral was that
of rejoicing. How is this, Fräulein
Angela; is that the custom here?"</p>

<p>She looked at him somewhat astonished.</p>

<p>"That is the custom in the whole
Catholic Church," she replied. "At
the burial of children she excludes all
sadness; and for that reason masses
of requiem in black vestments are
never said for them; but masses of
the angels in white."</p>

<p>"Do you not think the custom is
in contradiction to the sentiments of
nature&mdash;to the sorrowful feelings of
those who remain?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe so," she answered
tranquilly. "Human nature grieves
about many things over which the
spirit should rejoice."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>These words sounded enigmatically
to Richard.</p>

<p>"I do not comprehend the meaning
of your words, Fräulein Angela."</p>

<p>"Grief at the death of a relative is
proper for us, because a beloved person
has been taken from our midst. But
the church, on the contrary, rejoices
because an innocent, pure soul has
reached the goal after which we all
strive&mdash;eternal happiness. You see,
Herr Frank, that the church considers
the departure of a child from this
world from a more exalted point of
view, and comprehends it in a more
spiritual sense, than the natural affection.
While the heart grows weak
from sadness, the church teaches us
that Eliza is happy; that she has
gone before us, and that we will be
separated from her but for a short
time; that between us there is a spiritual
union which is based on the
communion of saints. Faith teaches
me that Eliza, rescued from all afflictions
and disappointments, is happy
in the kingdom of the blessed.
If I could call her back, I would not
do it; for this desire springs from
egotism, which can make no sacrifices
to love."</p>

<p>Her eyes were full of tears as she
said these last words. But that peculiar
joy which Richard had before
observed, and the meaning of which
he now understood, again lighted up
her countenance. He leaned back in
the carriage, and was forced to admit
that the religious conception of
death was very consoling, even
grand, when compared with that
conception which modern enlightenment
has of it.</p>

<p>The carriage moved slowly through
the silent court-yard, which lay as
gloomy under the clouds as though
it had put on mourning for the dead.
The chickens sat huddled together in
a corner, their heads sadly drooping.
Even the garrulous sparrows were
silent, and through the linden tops
came a low, rustling sound like greetings
from another world.</p>

<p>Assisted by Richard's hand, Angela
descended from the carriage. Her
father thanked him for his sympathy,
and expressed a wish to see him soon
again in the family circle. As Richard
glanced at Angela, he thought he
read in her look a confirmation of
all her father said. Siegwart's invitation
was unnecessary. The young
man was attracted more strongly to
the proprietor's house as Angela's
qualities revealed themselves to his
astonished view more clearly. But
Frank would not believe in the
spotlessness and sublime dignity of
a Christian maiden. He did not
change his former judgment against
the sex. His stubbornness still persisted
in the opinion that Angela had
her failings, which, if manifested,
would obscure the external brilliancy
of her appearance, but which remained
hidden from view. Continued
observation alone would, in Frank's
opinion, succeed in disclosing the repulsive
shadows.</p>

<p>Perhaps a proud determination to
justify his former opinions lay less at
the bottom of this obstinate tenacity
than an unconscious stratagem. The
young man anticipated that his respect
for Angela would end in passionate
affection as soon as she stood
before him in the full, serene power
of her beauty. He feared this power,
and therefore combated her
claims.</p>

<p>The professor had returned from
his excursion into the mountains, and
related what he had seen and heard.</p>

<p>"Such excursions on historic
grounds," said he, "are interesting
and instructive to the historical inquirer.
What historical sources hint
at darkly become distinct, and many
incredible things become clear and
intelligible. Thus, I once read in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
old chronicle that the monks during
choral service sung with such enchanting
sweetness that the empress
and her ladies and knights who were
present burst into tears. I smiled at
this passage from the garrulous old
chronicler, and thought that the fabulous
spirit of the middle ages had descended
into the pen of the good
man. How often have I heard Mozart's
divine music, how often have I
been entranced by the stormy, thrilling
fantasies of Beethoven! But I
was never moved to tears, and I never
saw even delicate ladies weep.
Two days ago, I wandered alone
among the ruins of the abbey of
Hagenroth. I stood in the ruined
church; above was the unclouded sky,
and high round about me the naked
walls. Here and there upon the walls
hung patches of plaster, and these
were painted. I examined the paintings
and found them of remarkable
purity and depth of sentiment. I examined
the painted columns in the
nave and choir, and found a beautiful
harmony. I admired the excellence
of the colors, on which it has snowed,
rained, and frozen for three hundred
and twenty years. I then examined
the fallen columns, the heavy capitals,
the beauty of the ornaments, and
from these significant remnants my
imagination built up the whole structure,
and the church loomed up before
me in all its simple grandeur and
charming finish. I was forced to recognize
and admire those artists who
knew how to produce such wonderful
and charming effects by such simple
combinations. I thought on
that passage of the chronicle, and I
believe if, at that moment, the simple,
pure chant of the monks had
echoed through the basilica, I also
would have been moved to tears.
If the monks knew, thought I, how
to captivate and charm by their
architecture, why could they not do
the same with music?"</p>

<p>"The stupid monks!" said Richard.</p>

<p>"If you had spoken those words at
my side in that tone as I stood amid
those ruins, they would have sounded
like malicious envy from the mouth
of the spirit of darkness."</p>

<p>"Your admiration for the monks
is indeed a great curiosity," said
Frank, smiling. "Sybel's congenial
friend a eulogist of the monks! That
indeed is as strange as a square circle."</p>

<p>"If I admire the splendor of heathenism,
must I not also admire the
fascinating, still depth of Christian
childhood? In heathenism as well
as in Christianity human genius accomplishes
great and sublime things."</p>

<p>"That, in its whole extent, I must
dispute," said Frank. "Where is the
splendor and greatness of heathenism?
The heathen built palaces of
great magnificence, but crime stalked
naked about in them. When the
lord of the palace killed his slaves
for his amusement, there was no law
to condemn him. When lords and
ladies at their epicurean feasts would
step aside into small apartments,
there by artificial means to empty
their gorged stomachs, they did not
offend either against heathen decency
or its law of moderation. The marble
columns proudly supported gilded
arches; but when beneath those arches
a human victim bled under the knife
of the priests, this was in harmony
with the genius of heathenism. The
amphitheatres were immense halls,
full of art and magnificence, in which
a hundred thousand spectators could
sit and behold with delight the lions
and tigers devour slaves, or the gladiators
slaughtering each other for
their amusement. No. True greatness
and real splendor I do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
find in heathenism. Where heathen
greatness is, there terrible darkness,
profound error, and horrible customs
abound. Christianity had to contend
for three hundred years to destroy
the abominations of heathenism."</p>

<p>"I will not dispute about it now,"
said Lutz. "You shall not destroy by
your criticism the beautiful impressions
of my excursion. I also met the
Swedes on my tour. About thirty miles
from here there is, among the hills, a
valley. The peasants call the place
the 'murder-chamber.' I suspected
that the name might be associated
with some historical event, and, on
inquiry, I found such to be the case.
In the Thirty Years' War, when Gustavus
Adolphus, the pious hero, passed
through the German provinces
murdering and robbing, the inhabitants
of the neighborhood fled with
their wives, children, and property to
this remote valley. They imagined
themselves hid in these woods and
defiles from the wandering Swedes,
but they deceived themselves. Their
hiding-place was discovered, and
every living thing&mdash;cows, calves, and
oxen excepted&mdash;was put to the
sword. 'The blood of the massacred,'
said my informer, 'flowed
down the valley like a brook; and
for fifty years the neighborhood was
desolate, because the Swedes had destroyed
every thing.' Such masterpieces
of Swedish blood-thirstiness
are found in many places in Germany;
and as the people celebrate them
in song and story, it is certain that
the pious hero has won for himself
imperishable fame in the art of
slaughter."</p>

<p>"Do you not wish to have the
'murder-chamber' appear in Sybel's
periodical?"</p>

<p>"No; fable must be carefully separated
from history; and in this case I
want the inclination for the subject."</p>

<p>"Fabulous! I find in the 'murder-chamber'
nothing but the true
Swedish nature of that time."</p>

<p>The professor shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Gustavus Adolphus may wander
for ever about Germany as the 'pious
hero,' if for no other purpose than to
annoy the ultramontanes."</p>

<p>Frank thought of the Siegwart
family.</p>

<p>"I believe we are unjust in our
judgments of the ultramontanes," said
he. "I visit every day a family
which my father declares not only to
be ultramontane, but even clerical,
and on account of it will not associate
with them. But I saw there
only the noble, good, and beautiful."
And he reported circumstantially
what he knew of the Siegwart family.</p>

<p>"You have observed carefully; and
in particular no feature of Angela has
escaped you. This Angela," he continued
jocosely, "must be an incarnate
ideal of the other world, since
she has excited the interest of my
friend, even though she wears crinoline."</p>

<p>"But she does not wear crinoline,"
said Frank.</p>

<p>"Not!" returned the professor,
smiling. "Then it is just right.
The Angel of Salingen belongs to the
nine choirs of angels, and was sent to
the earth in woman's form to win my
proud, woman-hating friend to the
fair sex."</p>

<p>"My conversion to the highest admiration
of women is by no means
impossible; at least in one case," answered
Richard, in the same earnest
tone.</p>

<p>"I am astonished!" said the professor.
"My interest is boundless.
Could I not see this wonderful lady?"</p>

<p>"Why not? It is eight o'clock.
At this hour I am accustomed to
make my visit."</p>

<p>"Let us go, by all means," urged
Lutz.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>On the way Frank spoke of Angela's
charitable practices, of her love
for the poor, her pious customs, and
of her deep religious sentiment, which
manifested itself in every thing; of
her activity in household matters, of
her modesty and humility. All this
he said in a tone of enthusiasm.
The professor listened with attention
and smiled.</p>

<p>As they went through the gate into
the large court-yard, they saw Angela
standing under the lindens. She
held a large dish in her hand.
About her pressed and crowded the
representatives of all races and nations
of that multitude which material
progress has raised from slavish
degradation. From Angela's hand
rained golden corn among the chattering
brood, who, pressed by a ravenous
appetite, hungrily shoved,
pushed, and upset each other. Even
the chivalrous cocks had forgotten
their propriety, and greedily snatched
up the yellow fruit without gallantly
cooing and offering the treasure to
the females. Nimble ducks glided
between the legs of the turkeys and
snatched up, quick as lightning, the
grains from their open bills. This
did not please the turkeys, who gobbled
and struck their sharp bills into
the bobbing heads of the ducks. A
solitary turkey cock alone scorned to
participate in the hungry pleasures
of the common herd. He spread his
wings stiffly like a crinoline around
his body, strutted about the yard, uttered
a gallant guttural gobble, and
played the fine lady in style.</p>

<p>Near the gate stood the stalls.
They all had double doors, so that
the upper part could be opened while
the lower half remained closed. As
the two friends passed, they saw a
massive head protruding through the
open half of one of those doors.
The head was red, and was set upon
the powerful shoulders of a steer who
had broken loose from his fastening
to take a walk about the yard.
When he saw the strangers, he began
to snort, cock his ears, and shake his
head, while his fiery eyes rolled wildly
in his head.</p>

<p>"A handsome beast," said Frank,
as he stopped. "How wide his
forehead, how strong his horns, how
powerful his chest!"</p>

<p>"His head," said Lutz, "would
be an expressive symbol for the
evangelist Luke."</p>

<p>The steer was not pleased with
these compliments. Bellowing angrily
he rushed against the door,
which gave way. Slowly and powerfully
came forth from the darkness
of the stall the colossal limbs of the
dangerous beast. The friends, unexpectedly
placed in the power of this
terrible enemy, stood paralyzed.
They beheld the colossus lashing his
sides with his tail, lowering his head
threateningly, and maliciously stealing
toward them like a cat stealing
to a mouse till she gets within a sure
spring of it. The steer had evidently
the same design on the strangers.
He thought to crush them with his
iron forehead and amuse himself
with tossing up their lifeless bodies.
They saw this, clearly enough, but
there was no time for flight. The
red steer in his mad onset would certainly
overtake and run them down.
Luckily, the professor remembered
from the Spanish bull-fights how they
must meet these beasts, and he
quickly warned his friend.</p>

<p>"If he charges, slip quickly to one
side."</p>

<p>Scarcely had the words escaped
his trembling lips, when the steer
gave a short bellow, lowered his head,
and, quick as an arrow, rushed upon
Frank. He jumped to one side, but
slipped and fell to the ground. The
steer dashed against a wagon that
was standing near, and broke several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
of the spokes. Maddened at the
failure of his charge, he turned quickly
about and saw Frank lying on the
ground, and rejoiced over his helpless
victim. Richard commended his soul
to God, but had enough presence of
mind not to move a limb; he even
kept his eyes closed. The steer
snuffed about, and Frank felt his
warm breath. The steer evidently
did not know how to begin with the
lifeless thing, until he took it into his
head to stick his horns into the yielding
mass. The young man was lost&mdash;now
the steer lowered his horns&mdash;now
came the rescue.</p>

<p>Angela had only observed the visitor
as the bellowing steer rushed at
him. All this took but a minute.
The servants were not then in the
yard; and before they could be called,
Richard would be gored a dozen
times by the sharp weapons of the
steer. The professor trembled in
every limb; he neither dared to cry
for help, lest he might remind the
steer of his presence, nor to move from
the place. He seemed destined to be
compelled to see his friend breathe
out his life under the torturing stabs.</p>

<p>Before this happened, however,
Angela's voice rang imperatively
through the yard. The astonished
steer raised his head, and when he saw
the frail form coming toward him
with the dish in her hand, he gave
forth a friendly low, and had even the
good grace to go a few steps to meet
her.</p>

<p>"Falk, what are you about?" said
she reproachfully. "You are a terrible
beast to treat visitors so."</p>

<p>Falk lowed his apology, and, as
he perceived the contents of the dish,
he awkwardly sank his mouth into it.
Angela scratched his jaws, at which
he was so delighted that he even forgot
the dish and held still like a child.
The professor looked on this scene
with amazement&mdash;the airy form before
the murderous head of the steer.
As Master Falk began even to lick
Angela's hand, the professor was
very near believing in miracles.</p>

<p>"So now, be right good, Falk!"
said she coaxingly; "now go back
where you belong. Keep perfectly
quiet, Herr Frank; do not move, and
it will be soon over."</p>

<p>She patted the steer on the broad
neck, and holding the dish before
him, led him to the stall, into which
he quickly disappeared.</p>

<p>Frank arose.</p>

<p>"You are not hurt?" asked Lutz
with concern.</p>

<p>"Not in the least," answered Frank,
taking out his pocket handkerchief
and brushing the dust from his clothes.
The professor brought him his hat,
which had bounced away when he
fell, and placed it on the head of his
trembling friend.</p>

<p>Angela returned after housing the
steer. Frank went some steps toward
her, as if to thank her on his
knees for his life; but he concluded
to stand, and a sad smile passed over
his countenance.</p>

<p>"Fräulein Angela," said he, "I
have the honor of introducing to you
my friend, Herr Lutz, professor at
our university."</p>

<p>"It gives me pleasure to know the
gentleman," said she. "But I regret
that, through the negligence of Louis,
you have been in great danger.
Great God! if I had not been in the
yard." And her beautiful face became
as pale as marble.</p>

<p>Richard observed this expression
of fright, and it shot through his
melancholy smile like rays of the
highest delight; but for his preserver
he had not a single word of thanks.
Lutz, not understanding this conduct,
was displeased at his friend, and undertook
himself to return her thanks.</p>

<p>"You have placed yourself in the
greatest danger, Fräulein Angela," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
he. "Had I been able when you
went to meet the steer, I would have
held you back with both hands; but
I must acknowledge that I was palsied
by fear."</p>

<p>"I placed myself in no danger,"
she replied. "Falk knows me well,
and has to thank me for many dainties.
When father is away, I have to
go into the stalls to see if the servants
have done their work. So all the
animals know me, and I can call them
all by name."</p>

<p>They went into the house.</p>

<p>"It is well that my parents are
absent to-day, and that the accident
was observed by no one; for my father
would discharge the Swiss who
has charge of the animals, for his
negligence. I would be sorry for
the poor man. I beg of you, therefore,
to say nothing of it to my father.
I will correct him for it, and I
am sure he will be more careful in
future."</p>

<p>While she spoke, the eyes of the
professor rested upon her, and it is
scarcely doubtful that in his present
judgment the splendor of the rostrum
was eclipsed. Frank sat silent,
observing. He scarcely joined
in the conversation, which his friend
conducted with great warmth.</p>

<p>"This occurrence," said Lutz, on
his way home, "appears to me like
an episode from the land of fables
and wonders. First, the steer fight;
then the overcoming of the beast by
a maiden; lastly, a maid of such
beauty that all the fair ones of romance
are thrown in the shade. By
heaven, I must call all my learning to
my aid in order to be able to forget
her and not fall in love up to the
ears!"</p>

<p>Frank said nothing.</p>

<p>"And you did not even thank her!"
said Lutz vehemently. "Your conduct
was more than ungallant. I do
not understand you."</p>

<p>"Nothing without reason," said
Frank.</p>

<p>"No matter! Your conduct cannot
be justified," growled the professor.
"I would like to know the reason
that prevented you from thanking
your preserver for your life?"</p>

<p>Richard stopped, looked quietly
into the glowing countenance of his
friend, and proceeded doubtingly,</p>

<p>"You shall know all, and then
judge if my offensive conduct is not
pardonable."</p>

<p>He began to relate how he met
Angela for the first time on the lonely
road in the forest, how she then
made a deep impression on him,
what he learned of her from the poor
man and from Klingenberg, and
how his opinion of womankind had
been shaken by Angela; then he
spoke of his object in visiting the
Siegwart family, of his observations
and experience.</p>

<p>"I had about come to the conclusion,
and the occurrence of to-day
realizes that conclusion, that Angela
possesses that admirable virtue which,
until now, I believed only to exist in
the ideal world. If there is a spark
of vanity in her, I must have offended
her. She must have looked resentfully
at me, the ungrateful man,
and treated me sulkily. But such
was not the case; her eyes rested on
me with the same clearness and kindness
as ever. My coarse unthankfulness
did not offend her, because
she does not think much of herself,
because she makes no pretensions,
because she does not know her
great excellence, but considers her
little human weaknesses in the light
of religious perfection&mdash;in short, because
she is truly humble. She will
bury this dauntless deed in forgetfulness.
She does not wish the little
and great journals to bring her courage
into publicity. Tell me a woman,
or even a man, who could be capable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
of such modesty? Who would risk
life to rescue a stranger from the
horns of a ferocious steer without
hesitation, and not desire an acknowledgment
of the heroic deed? How
great is Angela, how admirable in
every act! I was unthankful; yes, in
the highest degree unthankful. But
I placed myself willingly in this odious
light, in order to see Angela in
full splendor. As I said," he concluded
quietly, "I must soon confess
myself besieged&mdash;vanquished on
the whole line of observation."</p>

<p>"And what then?" said the professor.</p>

<p>"Then I am convinced," said
Richard, "that female worth exists,
shining and brilliant, and that in the
camp of the ultramontanes."</p>

<p>"A shaming experience for us," replied
the professor. "You make
your studies practical, you destroy
all the results of learned investigation
by living facts. To be just; it
must be admitted that a woman
like what you have described Angela
to be only grows and ripens
on the ground of religious influences
and convictions."</p>

<p>"And did you observe," said Richard,
"how modestly she veiled the
splendor of her brave action? She
denied that there was any danger in
the presence of the steer, although
it is well known that those beasts in
moments of rage forget all friendship.
Angela must certainly have felt this
as she went to meet the horns of
the infuriated animal to rescue me."</p>

<p>Frank visited daily, and sometimes
twice a day, the Siegwart family; he
was always received with welcome,
and might be considered an intimate
friend. The family spirit unfolded
itself clearer and clearer to his view.
He found that every thing in that
house was pervaded by a religious
influence, and this without any design
or haughty piety. The assessor
was destined to receive a striking proof
of this.</p>

<p>One afternoon a coach rolled into
the court-yard. The family were at
tea. The Assessor von Hamm entered,
dressed entirely in black; even
the red ribbon was wanting in the
button-hole.</p>

<p>"I have learned with grief of the
misfortune that has overtaken you,"
said he after a very formal reception.
"I obey the impulse of my heart
when I express my sincere sympathy
in the great affliction you have suffered
in the death of the dear little
Eliza."</p>

<p>The tears came into the eyes of
Madame Siegwart. Angela looked
straight before her, as if to avoid the
glance of the assessor.</p>

<p>"We thank you, Herr von Hamm,"
returned the proprietor. "We were
severely tried, but we are reasonable
enough to know that our family cannot
be exempted from the afflictions
of human life."</p>

<p>Hamm sat down, a cup was set
before him, and Angela poured him
out a cup of fragrant tea. The assessor
acknowledged this service with
his sweetest smile, and the most
obliged expression of thanks.</p>

<p>"You are right," he then said.
"No one is exempt from the stroke
of fate. Man must submit to the
unavoidable. To the ancients, blind
fate was terrific and frightful. The present
enlightenment submits with resignation."</p>

<p>If a bomb had plunged into the
room and exploded upon the table,
it could not have produced greater
confusion than these words of the
assessor. Madame Siegwart looked
at him with astonishment and
shook her head. The proprietor,
embarrassed, sipped his tea. Angela's
blooming cheeks lost their color.
Hamm did not even perceive the effect
of his fatal words, and Frank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
was scarcely able to hide his secret
pleasure at Hamm's sad mishap.</p>

<p>"We know no fate, no blind, unavoidable
destiny," said Siegwart, who
could not forgive the assessor his unchristian
sentiment. "But we know a
divine providence, an all-powerful will,
without whose consent the sparrow
does not fall from the house-top. We
believe in a Father in heaven who,
counts the hairs of our heads, and
whose counsels rule our destiny."</p>

<p>Hamm smiled.</p>

<p>"You believe then, Herr Siegwart,
that divine providence, or rather
God, has aimed that blow at you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; so I believe."</p>

<p>"Pardon me. I think you judge
too hard of God. It is inconsistent
with his paternal goodness to afflict
your beloved child with such misfortune."</p>

<p>"Misfortune? It is to be doubted
whether Eliza's death is a misfortune.
Perhaps her early departure from this
world is precisely her happiness; and
then we must reflect that God is
master of life and death. It is not
for us to call the Almighty to account,
even if his divine ordinances should
be counter to our wishes."</p>

<p>"I respect your religious convictions,
Herr Siegwart. Permit me,
however, to observe that God is
much too exalted to have an eye
to all human trifles. He simply created
the natural law; this he leaves
to its course. All the elements must
obey these laws. Every creature is
subject to them; and when Eliza
died, she died in consequence of the
course of these laws, but not through
God's express will. Do you not
think that this view of our misfortunes
reconciles us with the conceptions
we have of God's goodness?"</p>

<p>"No; I do not believe it, because
such a view contradicts the Christian
faith," replied Siegwart earnestly.
"What kind of a God, what kind of
a Father would he be who would let
every thing go as it might? He
would be less a father than the poorest
laborer who supports his family
in the sweat of his brow."</p>

<p>"And the whole army of misfortunes
that daily overtake the human
family? Does this army await the
command of God?"</p>

<p>"Do not forget, Herr Assessor,
that the most of these misfortunes
are deserved; brought on by our sins
and passions. If excesses would
cease, how many sources of nameless
calamities would disappear! For
the rest, it is my firm conviction that
nothing happens or can happen in the
whole universe without the express
will of God, or at least by his permission."</p>

<p>The official shook his head.</p>

<p>"This question is evidently of
great importance to every man,"
said Frank. "Man is often not master
of the course of his life; for it is
developed by a chain of circumstances,
accidents, and providential interferences
that are not in man's power.
I understand very well that to be
subject to blind chance, to an irrevocable
fate, is something disquieting
and discouraging to man. Equally
consoling, on the other hand, is the
Christian faith in the loving care of
an all-powerful Father, without whose
permission a hair of our head cannot
be touched. But things of such
great injustice, of such irresistible
power, and of such painful consequences
happen on earth, that I cannot
reconcile them with divine love."</p>

<p>While Frank spoke, Angela's eyes
rested on him with the greatest attention;
and when he concluded, she
lowered her glance, and an earnest,
thoughtful expression passed over her
countenance.</p>

<p>"There are accidents that apparently
are not the result of man's fault," said
Siegwart. "Torrents sweep over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
land and destroy all the fruit of man's
industry. Perhaps these torrents are
only the scourges which the justice
of God waves over a lawless land.
But I admit that among the victims
there are many good men.
Storms wreck ships at sea, and many
human lives are lost. Avalanches
plunge from the Alps and bury whole
towns in their resistless fall. It is
such accidents as these you have in
view."</p>

<p>"Precisely&mdash;exactly so. How will
you reconcile all these with the fatherly
goodness of God?" cried
Hamm triumphantly.</p>

<p>The proprietor smiled.</p>

<p>"Permit me to ask a question,
Herr Assessor. Why does the state
make laws?"</p>

<p>"To preserve order."</p>

<p>"I anticipated this natural reply,"
continued the proprietor. "If malefactors
were not punished, thieves
and desperadoes, their bad practices
being permitted, would have full
play. Then all order would vanish;
human society would dissolve into a
chaos of disorder. God also created
laws which are necessary for the
preservation of the natural order.
Storms destroy ships. If there were
no storms, all growth in the vegetable
kingdom would cease. Poisonous
vapors would fill the air, and every living
thing must miserably die. Avalanches
destroy villages. But if it did
not snow, the torrents would no longer
run, the streams would dry up and
the wells would disappear, and man
and beast would die of thirst. You
see, gentlemen, God cannot abolish
that law of nature without endangering
the whole creation."</p>

<p>"That explains some, but not all,"
replied Hamm. "God is all-powerful;
it would be but a trifle for him
to protect us by his almighty power
from the destructive forces of the elements.
Why does he not do so?"</p>

<p>"The reason is clear," answered
Angela's father. "God would have
constantly to work miracles. Miracles
are exceptions to the workings
of the laws of nature. Now, if God
would constantly suppress the power,
and unceasingly interrupt the laws
of nature, then there would be no
longer a law of nature. The supernatural
would have devoured the
natural. The Almighty would have
destroyed the present creation."</p>

<p>"No matter," said the official.
"God might destroy the natural
forces that are inimical to man; for all
that exists is only of value because
of its use to man."</p>

<p>"Then nothing whatever would
remain. All would be lost," said
Siegwart. "We speak and write
much about earthly happiness that
soon passes away. We glorify the
beauty of creation; but we forget
that God's curse rests on this earth,
and it does not require great penetration
to see this curse in all things."</p>

<p>"You believe, then, in the future
destruction of the earth?" asked
Hamm.</p>

<p>"Divine revelation teaches it," said
Siegwart. "The Holy Scriptures expressly
say there will be a new earth
and a new heaven; and the Lord
himself assures us that the foundations
of the earth will be overturned and
the stars shall fall from the heavens."</p>

<p>"The stars fall from the heavens!"
cried Hamm, laughing. "If you
could only hear what the astronomers
say about that."</p>

<p>"What the astronomers say is of
no consequence. They did not create
the heavenly bodies, and cannot
give them boundaries; besides, we
need not take the falling of the stars
literally. This expression may signify
their disappearance from the earth,
perhaps the abolition of the laws by
which they have heretofore been
moved, and the reconstruction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
those relations which existed between
heaven and earth prior to the fall.
God will then do what you now demand
of him, Herr von Hamm,"
concluded Siegwart, smiling. "He
will destroy the inimical power of nature,
so that the new earth will be
free from thorns, tears, and lamentations."</p>

<p>Thus they continued to dispute,
and the debate became so animated
that even Angela entered the list in
favor of providence.</p>

<p>"I believe," said she with charming
blushes, "that the miseries of this
earthly life can only be explained
and understood in view of man's eternal
destiny. God spares the sinner
through forbearance and mercy; he
sends trials and misfortunes to the
good for their purification. God demanded
of Abraham the sacrifice of
his only son; but when Abraham
showed obedience to the command,
and consented to make that boundless
sacrifice, he was provided with
another victim to offer sacrifice to
God."</p>

<p>"Fräulein Angela," exclaimed
Hamm enthusiastically, "you have
solved the problem. Your comprehensive
remark reconciles even the
innocent sufferers with repulsive decrees.
O Fräulein!"&mdash;and the assessor
fell into a tone of reverie&mdash;"were it
permitted me to go through life
by the side of a partner who possesses
your spirit and your conciliatory
mildness!"</p>

<p>Angela looked down blushing.
She was embarrassed, and dared not
raise her eyes. Her first glance,
after a few moments, was at Richard.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Frank wrote in his diary:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Even the preaching tone becomes her
admirably. Morality and religion flow from
her lips as from a pure fountain that vivifies
her soul."</p></blockquote>

<p>As yet he had not surrendered to
Angela.</p>

<p>Frank sprang from an obstinate
Westphalian stock; and that the Westphalians
have not exchanged their
stiff necks for those of shepherds,
is sufficiently proved by their stubborn
fight with the powers who
menaced their liberties. Had Frank
been a good-natured South-German
or even Municher, he would long
since have bowed head and knees to
the "Angel of Salingen." But he
now maintained the last position of
his antipathy to women against Angela's
superior powers.</p>

<p>He visited the Siegwart family not
twice, but thrice, even four times a
day. He appeared suddenly and
unexpectedly before Angela like a
spy who wished to detect faults.</p>

<p>Just as he was going over the
court, on one occasion, a tall lad
came up to him. The boy came
from the same fatal door through
which Master Falk had rushed out
upon Richard with such bad intentions.
The servant held his hat in
his right hand, and with his left fumbled
the bright buttons on his red
vest.</p>

<p>"Herr Frank, excuse me; I have
something to say to you. I have
wanted to speak to you for the last
three days, but could not because
my master was always in the way.
But now, as my master is in the
fields, I can state my trouble, if you
will allow me."</p>

<p>"What trouble have you?"</p>

<p>"I am the Swiss through whose
fault the steer came near doing you
a great injury. It is inexplicable to
me, even now, how the animal got
loose. But Falk is very cunning. I
cannot be too watchful of him. His
head is full of schemes; and before
you can turn around, he has played
one of his tricks. The chain has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
clasp with a latch, and how he broke
it, he only knows."</p>

<p>"It is all right," replied Frank.
"I believe you are not to blame."</p>

<p>"I am not to blame about the
chain. But I am for the door being
open, Miss Angela said; and she is
perfectly right. Therefore, I beg
your pardon and promise you that
nothing of the kind shall happen in
future."</p>

<p>"The pardon is granted, on condition
that you guard the steer better."</p>

<p>"Miss Angela said that too; and
she required me to ask your pardon,
which I have done."</p>

<p>Angela stood in the garden, hidden
behind the rose-bushes, and heard,
smiling, the conversation.</p>

<p>As Frank passed over the yard, she
came from the garden carrying a
basketful of vegetables. At the same
time a harvest-wagon, loaded with
rapes and drawn by four horses, came
into the yard.</p>

<p>"Your industry extends to the garden
also, Miss Angela," said Frank.
"Now I know no branch of housekeeping
that you cannot take a part
in."</p>

<p>"My work is, however, insignificant,"
she returned. "In a large
house there is always a great deal to
do, and every one must try to be useful."</p>

<p>"Your garden deserves all praise,"
continued Richard, eyeing the contents
of the baskets. "What magnificent
peas and beans!"</p>

<p>For the first time Frank observed
in her face something like flattered
vanity, and he almost rejoiced at this
small shadow on the celestial form before
him. But the supposed shadow
was quickly changed into light before
his eyes. "Father brought these
early beans into the neighborhood;
they are very tender and palatable.
Father likes them, and I am glad to
be able to make him a salad this evening.
He will be astonished to see his
young favorites of this year, eight
days earlier than formerly. There he
comes; he must not see them now."
She covered them with some lettuce.</p>

<p>And this was the shadow of flattered
vanity! Childish joy, to be able
to astonish her father with an agreeable
dish.</p>

<p>The loaded wagon stopped in the
yard; the horses snorted and pawed
the ground impatiently. The servants
opened the barn-doors, and
Frank saw on all sides activity and
haste to house the valuable crop.</p>

<p>Siegwart shook hands with the visitor.</p>

<p>"The first blessing of the year,"
said the proprietor. "The rapes have
turned out well. We had a fine
blooming season, and the flies could
not do much damage."</p>

<p>"I have often observed those little
flies in the rape-fields," said Frank.
"You can count millions of them; but
I did not know that they injured the
crop."</p>

<p>They both went into the house,
where a bottle of Munich beer awaited
them. Soon after, the servants
went through the hall, and Frank
heard Angela's voice from the kitchen,
where she was busily occupied. The
servants brought bread, plates, cheese,
and jugs of light wine to the servants'
room.</p>

<p>"Neighbor," said Siegwart, "I invite
you to-morrow afternoon at four
o'clock to a family entertainment&mdash;providing
it will be agreeable to you."</p>

<p>The invitation was accepted.</p>

<p>"You must not expect much from
the entertainment. It will, at least,
be new to you."</p>

<p>Frank was much interested in the
character of this ultramontane entertainment.
He thought of a May
party, a coronation party; but rejected
this idea, for Siegwart promised a
family entertainment, and this could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
not be a May party. He thought of
all kinds of plays, and what part Angela
would take in them. But the
play also seemed improbable, and at
last the subject of the invitation
remained an interesting mystery to
him, the solution of which he awaited
with impatience.</p>

<p>An hour before the appointed time
Richard left Frankenhöhe, after Klingenberg
had excused him from the
daily walk. He took a roundabout
way along the edge of the forest; for
he knew that the Siegwart family
would be at divine service, and he did
not wish to arrive at the house a moment
before the time. Sunday stillness
rested on all. The mountains
rose up a deep blue; the vari-colored
fields were partly yellow; the vineyards
alone were of a deep green, and
when the wind blew through them it
wafted with it the pleasant odors of
the vine-blossoms.</p>

<p>Madame Siegwart was just returning
home from Salingen between her two
children. Henry, a youth of seventeen
and the future proprietor of the
property, had the same manners as
his father. He walked leisurely on
the road-side, examining the blooming
wheat and ripening corn. When he
discovered nests of vine weevils, he
plucked them off and crushed the
eggs of the hated enemies of all
wine-growers. Angela remained constantly
at her mother's side, and as she
accidentally raised her eyes to where
Richard stood, he made a movement
as though he was caught disadvantageously.</p>

<p>A short distance behind them came
Siegwart, surrounded by some men.
They often stopped and talked in a
lively manner. Frank thought that
these men were also invited, and
hoped to become acquainted with the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élite</i> of Salingen. He was, however,
disappointed; for a short distance
from Siegwart's house the men turned
back to Salingen. They had only accompanied
the proprietor part of the
way. The servants of Siegwart also
came hastening along the road, first
the men-servants, and some distance
behind them the maid-servants.
Frank had observed this separation
before, and thought it must be in consequence
of the strict orders of the
master. Frank considered this narrow-minded,
and thought of finding
fault with it, in true modern spirit.
But then he considered the results of
his observations, which had extended
to the servants. He often admired
the industry and regular conduct of
these people. He never heard any
oath or rough expressions of passion;
every one knew his work, and performed
it with care and attention. He observed
this regular order with admiration,
particularly when he thought of
the disobedience, dissatisfaction, and
untrustworthiness of the generality of
servants. Siegwart must possess a
great secret to keep these people in
agreement and order; therefore he rejected
his former opinion of narrow-mindedness,
and believed the proprietor
must have good reason for this
separation of the sexes.</p>

<p>Frank remained for a time under
the shadow of an oak, looked at his
watch, and finally descended the
shortest way. He was expected by
Siegwart, and immediately conducted
to the large room. The arrangement
of the room showed at a glance its
use. There was a small altar at one
side, and religious pictures hung on
the walls. There was also a harmonium,
and on the windows hung curtains
on which were painted scenes
from sacred history. In the middle
of the room there was a desk, on
which lay a book. To the right of
the desk sat the men-servants, to the
left the maids, the Siegwart family in
the centre. A smile passed over
Frank's countenance at the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
religious entertainment&mdash;for him, at
least, a new sort of recreation. At
his entrance the whole assembly rose.
He greeted Angela and her mother,
pressed warmly the hand of Henry,
and took the seat allotted to him.</p>

<p>Angela ascended the pulpit, sat
down and opened the book. She
read the life of the servant St. Zitta,
whom the church numbers among the
saints. Angela read in a masterly
manner. The narrative tone of her
soft, melodious voice ran like a quickening
stream through the soul. Some
passages she pronounced with plastic
force, and into the delivery of
others she breathed warm life. All
listened with great attention. Zitta's
childhood passed in quick review,
then her hard lot with a master difficult
to please. The servants listened
with astonishment. They heard with
pious attention of Zitta's pure conduct,
of her fidelity and humility, of
her industry and self-denial. They
all felt personally their own deficiency
in comparison with this shining model.
When Angela closed the book, Frank
saw that the servants were deeply impressed.
Meditatively they left the
room, as though they had heard a
striking sermon.</p>

<p>"Ah!" thought Frank. "Now I
know one of the means by which
Siegwart influences his people."</p>

<p>"Now comes the second part of
the entertainment," said the proprietor,
taking Richard's arm. "We will
now go into the garden."</p>

<p>On the way thither Frank saw
under the lindens a long table set with
food and wine, and at it sat the servants.
Richard heard their conversation
in passing. They talked of St.
Zitta and recounted the striking facts
of her life.</p>

<p>Near the garden wall grew a vine-arbor,
which caught the cool air as it
passed and loaded it with pleasant
odors. Thousands of the flowers of
the blooming vine appeared between
the indented leaves. Each of these
diminutive flowers breathed forth a
fragrance which for sweetness of odor
could not be surpassed.</p>

<p>A young brood of goldfinches, who
had taken possession of the arbor, now
cleared off. They flew up on the
dwarf trees, or hid among the roses,
which of all colors and kinds grew in
the garden. The hungry young ones
cried incessantly, and tested severely
the parental duty of support. But
the old ones were not ashamed of this
duty. Here and there they caught
flies and other insects, and carried
them to the young ones, who stood with
outstretched wings and flabby bills
wide open. Then the old ones would
fly away again, light on the branches&mdash;mostly
on bean-stalks&mdash;make quick
dodges, wave their tails, smack their
tongues, and seize as quick as lightning
a harmless passing fly. The
sparrows did not behave so harmlessly.
They pecked at the bright shining
cherries that hung in full clusters
on the swaying branches. Others of
this sharp-billed gentry hopped about
on the strawberry-beds, and disfigured
the large berries as they tore off great
pieces of the soft meat. One of them
had even the boldness to hop about
on the decorated table that stood at
the upper end of the arbor, to strike
his sharp bill into the buttered bread,
make an examination of the preserves,
ogle the slices of ham, and admire
the black bottles that stood on the
ground. He also took to flight as
the company arrived. The vine-blossoms
seemed to send forth a sweeter
fragrance as Angela, bright and beaming,
approached, leaning on the arm
of her mother.</p>

<p>"Do you have this edifying reading
every Sunday?" asked Richard.</p>

<p>"Regularly," answered the proprietor.
"It is an old custom of our
family, and I find it has such good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
results that I will not have it abolished.
The servants are not obliged
to be present. They are free after
vespers, each one to employ himself
as best suits him. But it seldom happens
that a servant or a maid is absent.
They like to hear the legends,
and you may have remarked that
they listen with great attention to the
reading."</p>

<p>"I have observed it," said Frank.
"Miss Angela is also such an excellent
reader that only deaf people
would not attend."</p>

<p>She smiled and blushed a little at
this praise.</p>

<p>"I consider it a strict obligation of
employers to have a supervision over
the conduct of the servants," said
Madame Siegwart. "Many, perhaps
most, servants are treated like the
slaves in old heathen times. They
work for their masters, are paid for
it, and there the relation between
master and servant ends. This is why
they neglect divine service on Sundays
and feast-days; their moral wants are
not satisfied, their natural inclinations
are not purified by restraints of a
higher order. The servants sit in the
taverns, where they squander their
wages, and the maids rove about and
gossip. This is a great injustice to
the servants, and full of bad consequences.
It cannot be questioned
that masters should shield their servants
from error and keep them under
moral discipline."</p>

<p>"Precisely my opinion," returned
Frank. "If servants are frequently
spoiled and general complaint is made
of it, the masters are greatly in fault.
I have long since admired the conduct
of your servants. I looked upon
Herr Siegwart as a kind of sorcerer,
who conjured every thing under his
charge according to his will. Now a
part of the sorcery is clear to me."</p>

<p>"Well, you were favorable in your
judgment," said the proprietor, laughing.
"So you considered me a magician;
others consider me an ultramontanist,
and that is something
still worse."</p>

<p>Richard smiled and blushed slightly.</p>

<p>"You no doubt have heard this
honorable title applied to me, Herr
Frank?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have heard of it."</p>

<p>"And I scarcely deceive myself in
supposing," continued Siegwart good-humoredly,
"that your father has
spoken to you of his neighbor, the
ultramontane."</p>

<p>"You do not deceive yourself at
all," answered Frank. "I consider
it a great honor to have become better
acquainted with the ultramontane."</p>

<p>"I have often wished to speak to
you," continued the proprietor, "of
the reason which called forth your
father's displeasure with me. I suppose,
however, that you have heard
it."</p>

<p>"My father never spoke of it, and
I am eager to know the unfortunate
cause."</p>

<p>"It is as follows. About ten
years ago your father, with some
other gentlemen, wished to establish
a great factory in this neighborhood.
The land on which it was to stand is
a marsh lying near a pond, the water
of which was to be made of use to
the factory. I tried with all my
power to prevent this design, and
even for social and religious reasons.
Our neighborhood needed no factory.
There are but few very poor people,
and these support themselves sufficiently
well among the farmers. Experience
proves that factories have a bad effect
on the people in their neighborhood.
Our people are firm believers. The
peasants keep conscientiously the
Sundays and festivals. In all their
cares for the earthly they do not forget
the eternal life. This religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
sentiment spreads happiness and
peace over our quiet neighborhood.
The factory, which knows no Sunday,
and the operatives, who are sometimes
very bad men, would have
brought a harsh discordance into the
quiet harmony of the neighborhood.
I considered these and other injurious
influences, and offered a higher
price for the swamp than your father
and his friends. As there was no
other convenient place about, the enterprise
had to be given up. Since
that time your father is offended with
me because I made his favorite project
impossible. This is the way it
stands. That it is painful to me, I
need not assure you. But according
to my principles and views I could
not do otherwise. Now judge how
far I am to be condemned."</p>

<p>"I speak freely," said Frank.
"You have acted from principles
that one must respect, and which my
father would have respected if he
had known them."</p>

<p>The proprietor could have observed
that he had, in a long letter, justified
himself to Herr Frank. But he
suppressed the observation, as he felt
it would be painful to his son.</p>

<p>"Father," said Henry, "hunger
and thirst are appeased. Can I ride
out for an hour?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my son; but not longer.
Be back by supper-time."</p>

<p>The young man promised, and, after
a friendly bow to Frank, hastened
from the garden. The little circle
continued some time in friendly chat.
The servants under the lindens became
noisy and sang merry songs.
The maids sat around the tea-table
in the kitchen and praised St. Zitta.</p>

<p>The cook appeared in the arbor
and announced that Herr von
Hamm was in the house, and wished
to speak on important business to
Herr and Madame Siegwart.</p>

<p>"What can he want?" said the
proprietor in surprise. "Excuse me,
Herr Frank; the business will soon
be over. I beg you to remain till
we return. Angela, prevent him
from going."</p>

<p>Angela, smiling, looked after her
retiring parents and then at Richard.</p>

<p>"I must keep you, Herr Frank.
How shall I begin?"</p>

<p>"That is very easy, Fräulein.
Your presence is sufficient to realize
your father's wish. A weak child of
human nature cannot resist one who
can conquer steers."</p>

<p>"Now you make a steer-catcher
of me. Such a thing never happened
in Spain; for there the steers are not
so cultivated and docile as they are
with us."</p>

<p>She took out her knitting.</p>

<p>"This is Sunday, Miss Angela!"</p>

<p>"Do you consider knitting unlawful
after one has fulfilled one's religious
duties?"</p>

<p>"The case is not clear to me,"
said Frank, smiling secretly at the
earnestness of the questioner. "My
casuistic knowledge is not sufficient
to solve such a question reasonably."</p>

<p>"The church only forbids servile
work," said she. "I consider knitting
and sewing as something better
than doing nothing."</p>

<p>"I am rejoiced that you are not
narrow-minded, Fräulein. But this
little stocking does not fit your feet?"</p>

<p>"It is for little bare feet in Salingen,"
she replied, laying the finished
stocking on the table and stroking it
with both hands as a work of love.</p>

<p>"I have heard of your beneficence,"
said Frank. "You knit, sew,
and cook for the poor people. You
are a refuge for all the needy and
distressed. How good in you!"</p>

<p>"You exaggerate, Herr Frank. I
do a little sometimes, but not more
than I can do with the housework,
which is scarcely worth mentioning.
I make no sacrifice in doing it; on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
the contrary, the poor give me more
than I give them; for giving is to
every one more pleasant than receiving."</p>

<p>"To every one, Fräulein?"</p>

<p>"To every one who can give
without denying herself."</p>

<p>"But you are accustomed also to
visit the sick, and the hovels of poverty
are certainly not attractive."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Herr Frank, very attractive,"
she answered quickly. "The
thanks of the poor sick are so affecting
and elevating that one is paid a
thousand times for a little trouble."</p>

<p>Frank let the subject drop. Angela
did not give charities from
pride or the gratification of vanity, as
he had been prepared to assume, but
from natural goodness and inclination
of the heart. He looked at the
beautiful girl who sat before him industriously
sewing, and was almost
angry at his failure to detect a fault
in her pure nature.</p>

<p>"Do you always adorn the statue
of the Virgin on the mountain?"
said he after a pause.</p>

<p>"No; not now. The month of
our dear Lady is over. I always
think with pleasure of the happy
hours when in the convent we adorned
her altar with beautiful flowers."</p>

<p>"You must have a great reverence
for Mary, or you would not ascend
the mountain daily."</p>

<p>"I admire the exalted virtues of
Mary, and think with sorrow of her
painful life on earth; and then, a
weak creature needs much her powerful
protection."</p>

<p>"Do you expect, Miss Angela,
by such attention as you show the
statue to obtain protection of the
saint?"</p>

<p>"No, I do not believe that. The
adorning of the pictures of saints
would be idle trifling if the heart
wandered far from the spirit of the
saints. Our church teaches, as you
know, that the real, true veneration
of the saints consists in imitating
their virtues."</p>

<p>Frank sat reflecting. The examination
and probation were thoroughly
disgusting to him. Siegwart appeared
in the garden, and came with
quick steps to the arbor. His countenance
was agitated and his eyes
glowed with indignation. Without
speaking a word, he drank off a glass
of wine. Frank saw how he endeavored
not to exhibit his anger.</p>

<p>"Has Herr von Hamm departed?"
asked Richard.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is off again," said the
proprietor. "Angela, your mother
has something to say to you."</p>

<p>"Now guess what the assessor
wanted?" said Siegwart, after his
daughter had left the arbor.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he wanted the Peter-pence
collection," said Frank, smiling.</p>

<p>"No. Herr von Hamm wanted
nothing more or less than to marry
my daughter!"</p>

<p>Frank was astonished. Although
he long since saw through Hamm's
designs, he did not expect so sudden
and hasty a step.</p>

<p>"And in what manner did he demand
her?"</p>

<p>"It is revolting," said the proprietor,
much offended. "Herr von
Hamm graciously condescends to us
peasants. He showed that it would
be a great good fortune for us to give
our daughter to the noble, the official
with brilliant prospects."</p>

<p>"Herr von Hamm does not think
little of himself," said Richard drily.</p>

<p>"How did the man ever come to
ask my daughter? He and Angela!
What opposites!"</p>

<p>"Which, of course, you made clear
to him."</p>

<p>"I reminded the gentleman that
identity of moral and religious principles
alone could render matrimonial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
happiness possible. I reminded him
that Angela was an ultramontane,
whose opinions would daily annoy
him, while his modern opinions must
deeply offend Angela. This I set
before him briefly. Then I told him
frankly and freely that I did not wish
to make either him or Angela unhappy,
and at this he went away angrily."</p>

<p>"You have done your duty," said
Frank. "I am also of opinion that
similar convictions in the great principles
of life alone insure the happiness
of married life."</p>

<p>When Richard came home, he
wrote in his diary:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"June 4.&mdash;Unconditional surrender.
What I supposed only to exist in the ideal
world is realized in the daughter of an ultramontane.
Angela, compared to our crinolines,
our flirts, our insipid coquettes&mdash;how
brilliant the light, how deep the shadow!</p>

<p>"My visits to that family have no longer
a purpose. I feel they must be discontinued
for the sake of my peace. I dare not
dream of a happiness of which I am unworthy.
But my future life will feel painfully
the want of a happiness the possibility of
which I did not dream. This is a punishment
for presuming to penetrate the pure,
glorious character of the Angel of Salingen."</p></blockquote>

<p>He buried his face in his hands and
leaned on the table. He remained
thus a long time; when he raised his
head, his face was pale, and his eyes
were moist with tears.</p>

<h2>DR. HARWOOD'S PRICE LECTURE.</h2>


<p>A certain Mr. Price, of Boston,
left a sum of money for a course of
annual lectures, one of which is to
be against "Romanism," and Dr.
Harwood, the rector of Trinity
church, New-Haven, having been
selected as the lecturer for the current
year, has favored us with the publication
of his lecture on "Romanism,"
in the pages of the <cite>New-Englander</cite>,
as well as in the form of a
separate pamphlet. The dignified
place which is held by the author of
this lecture, as well as his personal
character and influence, give a considerable
weight to whatever he may
publicly say on such a topic, in addition
to the intrinsic claim it may have
on the attention of both his partisans
and opponents. On this account,
and moreover on account of the
tangible, well-exposed issue which
distinguishes the production of the
reverend doctor from most of the
<i>brochures</i> of his polemical associates,
we have thought it worth while to devote
a little time to the discussion of
its contents.</p>

<p>Dr. Harwood does not attempt a
formal argument against the claims of
the Roman Church to supremacy over
all Christendom. He is addressing
an audience with whom, as with himself,
it is a foregone conclusion that
these claims are baseless, and Romanism
a fearful, dangerous superstition.
There is a tone of dislike and fear
running through the lecture with
which the audience is expected to
sympathize fully, as when something
is spoken of whose very mention is
sufficient to awaken the aversion of
all the moral sensibilities without any
need of showing reasons. Just as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
mere mention of the words polytheism,
Mohammedanism, Mormonism,
call up those sentiments of the falsehood
and evil of the things they represent,
which are interwoven with
the intellectual and moral constitution
inherited from our ancestors, nurtured
by education, and governing
our judgments like a second nature,
so the mere pronunciation of the
terms Rome, pope, sacrifice of the
mass, with their derivatives and the
other phrases associated with them,
are quite sufficient to carry away an
average New-England audience in a
tide of sympathy with any anti-Roman
orator. It was not necessary,
therefore, for Dr. Harwood to argue
with an audience already convinced,
in proof of the position that the
Roman Church must be resisted and
opposed. The question to be considered
was how best to do it? What
are the points to be attacked? is one
division of the question; by what
road, with what weapons are these
points to be attacked? is the other.
With a singular and very honorable
manliness and directness, the lecturer
puts aside all secondary issues and
places himself openly in front of the
fundamental dogmatic basis of the
Roman Church, with the avowal that
it is necessary to the victory of his
cause to attack and subvert this central
stronghold. He seeks to ascertain,
like a topographical engineer
who is laying out positions for a bombardment,
the precise situation and
extent of this central work, and the
exact spot on which the heavy guns
which are to play upon it must be
planted. It remains yet to be seen
whether his report will be accepted
by the leaders of his side, and an attempt
made to carry out the bold,
perhaps somewhat hazardous, strategy
which he recommends.</p>

<p>Aside from all preliminaries and accompaniments
which serve to give rhetorical
finish and effect to the lecture as
a popular oration, its gist and pith consist
in the statement that the two dogmas
of the sacrifice of the mass and the
papal supremacy form the constitutive
principle of the Roman Church, which
the masters of heavy polemics are recommended
to step up and overthrow.
We have no objection to this issue, and
are perfectly willing to fight the whole
campaign through on that line. If the
doctor intends, however, to define precisely
and scientifically that these two
dogmas together constitute the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">differentia</i>
of the doctrine of the Roman
Church, his definition is open to criticism.
The dogma of the sacrifice of the
mass is no part of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">differentia</i> which
distinguishes the Roman Church from
the Eastern Christians, or from a respectable
party in the author's own
communion. The true <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">differentia</i>
marking the Catholic Church in the
communion and under the headship
of the Bishop of Rome, as a sole and
singular organization without its like
among all the corporate religious societies
of the world, is what is called
in theological language the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">juge magisterium
ecclesiæ</i>, the living, perpetual,
infallible, supreme authority in
spirituals exercised in constant and
uninterrupted continuity, and keeping
the body of the church in indefectible
unity. This magistracy is focussed
and capitalized in the headship of
the primatial see of the world, the
Roman Church, and the supremacy
of its bishop. A Greek or an Anglo-Catholic
may hold theoretically that
this <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magisterium</i> belongs rightfully to
the church, and could be exercised in
case the church were assembled in
what each of them respectively would
acknowledge to be an &oelig;cumenical
council. Neither of them, however,
can acknowledge the continuous and
present exercise of this plenary authority,
because both are obliged to maintain
that the church is in a disunited,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
disorganized state. It is precisely because
both refuse to acknowledge the
papal supremacy, that they deny the
church in communion with Rome to be
the complete church in organized unity
and its general councils to be &oelig;cumenical.
It is precisely this supremacy
which makes this church an organized
unit, and places it in the condition to
act with full and complete power. The
supremacy of the pope may, therefore,
stand for the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">differentia</i>, and we are
willing to accept it as such, with the
explanation above given, that it includes
also the unbroken unity, together
with the plenary judicial and legislative
power of the Catholic episcopate
as a whole, including both the pope
as supreme head, and the bishops as
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conjudices cum papa</i>, or fellow-judges
and rulers, with and under the pope,
of the universal church.</p>

<p>This simplifies the issue, and reduces
the controversy, as between the
Roman Church on one side, and all
professed Christians refusing to acknowledge
her supremacy as "mother
and mistress of churches" on the
other, to one question only. A victory
on this one question is for us
complete and decisive, for it enables
us to sweep the whole battle-field.
If the supremacy we claim for the
pope is established, the obligatory
force of all the doctrines and laws
proclaimed by him as head of the
universal church is established also,
without need of further argument, or
possibility of appeal to any other tribunal
on the earth or in heaven. If
our antagonists could vanquish us, our
cause would be a lost one; we should
be brought down to a common level
with the Greeks as a mere branch of
the church, and the way would be
open for those negotiations in view of
the "reunion of Christendom" which
to certain persons seem so desirable.
There would still remain, however, a
vast field of controversy before one
holding what we understand to be
Dr. Harwood's views could make his
position good. The entire hierarchical
system of the Eastern churches,
maintained also in theory by such a
powerful party in the doctor's own
church, would remain to be refuted
and overthrown. Suppose this to be
done, and we will readily concede
that the system of what is called the
broad-church school, represented by
Stanley, Robertson, the author of
the book called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liber Librorum</i>; to
whom we think might be added the
New-Haven divines, and the higher
school of Unitarians, such as Dr.
Bellows, Dr. Osgood, Mr. Ellis, Mr.
Alger, and others; is the most rational
and sensible of all the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soi-disant</i>
Christian systems which would be left
on the ground. Perhaps Dr. Harwood,
looking on Greek Christianity
and the amateur catholicity of his
own brethren as without real significance,
intended to find some doctrine
which might stand for the entire
hierarchical, sacramental system, and
which, joined with the doctrine of
papal supremacy, might with that
make up the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">differentia</i> of the Roman
Church in respect to Protestantism.
In this point of view, he has well
chosen the doctrine of the sacrifice
of the mass. Our preceding strictures
are merely critical, and we are
willing to meet Dr. Harwood on the
precise ground he has chosen for
himself, the wager of battle being
this: that our Lord Jesus Christ
established the papal supremacy and
the sacrifice of the mass, as essential
parts of his religion. Since the doctor
has only appeared, however, in the
character of a scout, to clear the way
for more heavily-armed combatants,
and merely skirmishes a little in advance,
we will skirmish in the same
manner, without engaging more deeply
in the controversy than simply
to repel his attacks. If the champions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
he has called on come up,
which we very much doubt, we hope
they will go to work in earnest, and
undertake to meet and answer in detail
all the proofs and arguments adduced
by our able writers, at least
in English, in support of the papal
supremacy and the eucharistic sacrifice.
Unless they do this, they will
not be entitled to any notice at our
hands.</p>

<p>So far as Dr. Harwood merely describes
the doctrine we hold respecting
the papal supremacy, he is almost entirely
correct, and so eloquent that
the effect produced in his mind by its
grandeur, in spite of his inward reluctance,
is visible. Of argument
against it there is hardly the semblance,
a point we note not to the
author's disadvantage, but merely as
a reason for not arguing in its favor.
One passing objection he does throw,
as he goes by, at the title supreme
pontiff or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pontifex maximus</i>. This
word appears to alarm him, and no
doubt alarmed all the excellent ladies
and other worthy persons in his
audience, who are easily alarmed by
words. "He is regarded as the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pontifex maximus</i> of the whole church
of Christ. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pontifex maximus!</i> The
very word brings up memories of the
imperial city before it became Christian.
Julius Cæsar was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pontifex
maximus</i>&mdash;the office was held by all
the Cæsars&mdash;it was held while the disciples
of Jesus Christ, worshipping their
Lord in the catacombs, or dying in
the amphitheatre 'to make a Roman
holiday,' associated the office with all
cruelty and impiety." If this passage
is any thing more than a rhetorical
flourish, it means that the name and
office of supreme pontiff are bad, unchristian
things, because the heathen
had them. We ought, then, to carry
this principle out to its fullest extent.
The heathen had an order of men
specially devoted to religion, public
prayers, holy days, temples, religious
hymns, etc., therefore we should have
none of these. The surplice which
Dr. Harwood wears is derived
through the Jews, from the ancient
Egyptian priests; his prayer-book is
full of observances derived from the
Roman Church. He preaches sermons
and observes a fast of forty
days, like the Mohammedans, all of
which is very wrong, and reminds
us painfully of Pharaoh, and the
fires of Smithfield, and the cruel persecutions
of the Turks against the
Christians. The Jews had a high
priest appointed by Almighty God.
Our Lord is a high-priest, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pontifex
maximus</i>. Heathen perversions or
travesties of divine things make no
argument against the things themselves.
Neither is there any reason
why names, forms, observances, used
by heathen, if they are good and
suitable, should not be adopted by
Christians, just as we appropriate
heathen architecture, take possession
of heathen temples, and employ
heathen philosophy in the service of
religion. We have no doubt that
Moses imitated the civil and religious
customs of the Egyptians to a very
great extent in the prescriptions of
his law. Parallelisms between the
Catholic religion and various false
religions may easily enough be pointed
out. We laugh at such an argument
as not worthy of being seriously
refuted. The greater the number of
analogies that can be pointed out, the
stronger is the proof that the principles
of our religion are derived
from the origin of the race, universal,
and in accordance with human nature.
Rome was not all bad before
it was converted. Whatever in it was
good did not need to be abolished,
but only sanctified. Our Lord drove
out Jupiter, the angels and saints
supplanted the imaginary divinities
of Olympus, the successor of Peter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
took the place of the successor of
Cæsar. The glorious temples of the
gods became Christian churches, and
Roman polity became an organizing
power over all Christendom. In
this was only fulfilled the prophecy
of St. Paul, "<i>The God of peace shall
bruise Satan under your feet shortly</i>."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
This kind of play upon words with
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pontifex maximus</i> will, therefore, help
Dr. Harwood very little unless he
can disprove the existence of the
thing they represent&mdash;a human priesthood
with a supreme head over it,
possessing power delegated by Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p>The lecturer is not precisely accurate
in what he says of the definition
of the immaculate conception. The
judgment of the Catholic bishops
and doctors had been for ages manifested,
and was taken anew in the
most formal manner, before Pius IX.
proclaimed his definition. Those few
persons among the prelates and theologians
who were opposed to the
definition, did not merely submit
outwardly by keeping silence, but inwardly
by an interior submission of
the mind, precisely as a good Christian
would have submitted to St. Peter
himself in a similar case. If Dr.
Harwood admits the doctrinal infallibility
of the New Testament, he can
easily understand that, if the meaning
of any passage in it about which he
had previously doubted should be
made clear to him, he would have to
give his interior assent to it, even
though he must change an opinion
he had held all his life long. Precisely
so with us. An infallible judgment
makes known to us with the
certainty of faith the true sense of
the divine revelation, which we receive
accordingly as equally certain
and obligatory on the conscience
with every other revealed truth.
Whoever does not give this inward
assent becomes a heretic, and therefore
Pius IX., in his Bull <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ineffabilis</i>,
pronounces that every one who does
not believe the immaculate conception
as a revealed truth has suffered
shipwreck of the faith.</p>

<p>In his account of the Catholic doctrine
of the sacrifice of the mass the
author of the lecture is less successful,
and misrepresents it seriously; not intentionally,
or through wilful carelessness,
but through a misunderstanding
of Catholic phraseology. Because
the church calls it the <em>same sacrifice</em>
with the sacrifice of the cross, he appears
to think that our Lord is believed
to have redeemed the world
by the oblation of himself at the institution
of the eucharist, and to be
continually repeating this act of redemption
in the sacrifice offered daily
on our altars. Dr. Seabury, the first
Protestant bishop of Connecticut, did
actually teach that our Lord offered
himself in the eucharist as a sacrifice,
and not on the cross. This strange
notion of the founder of his own
diocese, Dr. Harwood incorrectly ascribes
to the Catholic Church.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The <em>sacrifice</em> was made or instituted in
the night in which he was betrayed; and,
in the system of Romanism, this sacrifice
is every thing. I do not see that the cross
is necessary; for the stress falls upon the
sacrifice of the altar, and the worshipper is
directed to that sacrifice as vested with objective
propitiatory virtue."</p></blockquote>

<p>The church teaches that our Lord
redeemed the world by his death
and the shedding of his blood upon
the cross. He did not redeem it by
the oblation of himself in the Last
Supper, nor does he do so by the
sacrifice of the altar; the sacrifice of
redemption having been offered once
for all upon the cross, and not needing
to be repeated. The church
does not mean by "same sacrifice"
that the oblation in the eucharist is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
a similar act of redemption, propitiatory
in the divided sense, or merely
as containing the body and blood of
Christ, and presenting them before
God. The sacrifice is the same, because
the victim is the same, the
priest is the same, and all the value
or merit contained and applied in
the sacrifice of the altar is derived
from the bloody sacrifice of the cross.
There is thus a moral unity binding
together the innumerable acts of consecration
and oblation which take place
on the Christian altars with each other
and with the sacrifice of the cross,
in one whole, just as the innumerable
acts of obedience performed by our
Lord during his earthly life make
one integral act of obedience with
the final and consummating act of
his oblation on Mount Calvary. No
doubt the intrinsic excellence of the
sacrifice of the eucharist is infinite, and
therefore sufficient for the redemption
of this world or a thousand others, if
there were others needing redemption.
The merit of the circumcision,
the fasting, the prayer, the preaching,
the poverty and humiliation, the labors
and tears of our Blessed Lord
was infinite, and fully adequate to the
redemption of mankind, without the
sacrifice of the cross. Every act of
love to God the Father proceeding
from the sacred heart of Jesus Christ
in heaven is simply infinite in its intrinsic
value. Yet no Catholic theologian
maintains that the meritorious
acts of our Lord performed while he
was a wayfarer on the earth redeemed
mankind apart from his death, or
that he has merited any additional
grace for men since his sacrifice was
completed. The sacrifice which our
Lord offered in the Last Supper did
not, therefore, constitute that act of
expiation to which, in the divine decree,
the remission of original and
actual sin was annexed; and much
less is there any such distinct, expiatory
merit in the sacrifice which he
perpetually makes of himself in the
eucharist, since his meritorious work
has been consummated. He offered
himself once for all as a bloody sacrifice
upon the cross, meriting thereby
an eternal redemption. At the Last
Supper he offered up himself to the
Father as the Lamb who was to be
slain the next day, presenting by anticipation
the merit which he would
gain by his cruel and ignominious
death, as an act of adoration, thanksgiving,
expiation, and impetration in
behalf of all those who were included
either generally or specially in his
intention. Doubtless, he frequently
in prayer had presented these same
merits to his Father; and from the
time of Adam's sin these same merits
had constituted the only ground on
which pardon or grace had been conferred,
thus verifying the appellation
applied to our Lord in the Scripture
of "the Lamb slain from the foundation
of the world." In the sacrifice
now offered by the priests of the new
law, Christ is presented before the
Eternal Father as the Lamb who has
been slain. And although, as a sacrifice,
the eucharist is equally an oblation
of the body and blood of the
Lamb of God with the sacrifice of
the cross, differing only in the manner
of offering, yet as this manner
of offering upon the cross by pain,
blood-shedding, and death constituted
the precise act which expiated sin
and redeemed the world, the sacrificial
nature of the eucharistic action
which it has in common with the
crucifixion does not derogate from
the exclusive attribute belonging to
the latter as the redemptive expiation
or the sacrifice of ransom, blotting
out the curse of the fall, and reopening
the gates of heaven to our lost race.
A sacrifice of expiation including all
ages, all men, and all sins having
been once offered, there is no need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
and no place for another, which is
precisely what St. Paul proves in the
Epistle to the Hebrews. Dr. Harwood
fancies that we have a dread
of that epistle. It is not long since
we went through that epistle carefully
with a theological class without
being aware of any sentiments of repugnance
to its doctrine arising in
our minds. It is very true that the
unlearned and unstable may wrest
this, as they do the other epistles
of St. Paul and the Scriptures generally,
to a sense in contradiction
to the Catholic faith. To one, however,
who is sufficiently learned to
understand the real scope and intent
of the apostle, or sufficiently docile to
receive the instruction of competent
interpreters, it presents no difficulty.
St. Paul is not speaking of the eucharist
or of the Christian priesthood
at all, but is confronting the priesthood
and sacrifices of Jesus Christ in the
work of redemption with the priesthood
and sacrifices of the old law,
as these were understood by unbelieving
or heterodox Jews. The
point to be established was, that Jesus
Christ would never give up his
priesthood to a successor, or offer up
another sacrifice similar to the one
offered on the cross. It needs no
reasoning to show that Catholic
priests do not pretend to be in the
place of Jesus Christ, but simply his
instruments. The perpetuity of his
priesthood is therefore not in the
slightest degree incompatible with
ours, which is in a different line, but
rather requires it. Neither is it necessary
to prove that we do not pretend
to offer a sacrifice which expiates
sins or atones for persons not included
in the sacrifice of the cross.
The doctor misunderstands the phrase
"propitiatory sacrifice." The church
does not mean that a new sacrifice is
offered for persons whose sins were
unatoned for on the cross, or who
have fallen a second time under the
curse and need a new ransom. The
word "propitiatory" merely denotes
that in the sacrifice of the altar an
application is made of the merits of
Christ's death to individuals for the
remission of temporal penalties due
to the justice of God. The redemption
was made on the cross; the application
of the grace of remission is
made in the sacrament of penance;
the remission of temporal penalties,
both for the living and the dead, is
obtained through the sacrifice of the
altar. All the efficacy of the divine
eucharist, whether as a sacrifice or a
sacrament, is derived from the merits
of Jesus Christ, which were consummated
in his death. It is, therefore,
by the application of the merit of the
sacrifice of the cross that the sacrifice
of the mass becomes efficacious
to salvation. The Lamb of God is
presented before the Father with the
merit acquired by his death upon
Mount Calvary, and this presentation
is an act of supreme adoration, of
thanksgiving, of impetration, and of
satisfaction for the debt due to the
divine justice, made in a sensible, visible
manner, with mystic rites and
ceremonies; which is enough to constitute
a sacrifice in the strict and
proper sense, whatever difference of
opinion there may be concerning the
essence of the sacrificial act in the
eucharist. Although, therefore, there
are many priests and many sacrifices
numerically, it is one act performed
by one person which is exhibited and
applied in all, so that there is truly
but one sacrifice and one priest.
The reverend doctor might have
seen this for himself if he had reflected
more carefully on the words of
the Council of Trent which he has
himself quoted, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cujus quidem oblationis
cruentæ, inquam, fructus per hanc
uberrime percipiuntur</i>&mdash;"The fruits of
which bloody oblation, indeed, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
by this most abundantly partaken
of."</p>

<p>The words of the lecturer following
his exposition of the doctrine are
not at first sight intelligible. "We
may be pardoned, then, if we ask
what then is our Lord to us personally?"
It is very difficult to see how
the hidden presence of our Lord under
the sacramental veils is any obstruction
to our personal relation to
him as our Saviour. How does this
presence derogate from the fact that
he died for each of us on the cross,
and is ever living in heaven to make
intercession for us? Our adoration
of his sacred body and precious
blood under the forms of bread and
wine does not hinder our meditating
upon his passion and death upon the
cross, or raising our mental eye to
his glorious form at the right hand
of God. The author appears to imagine
that his sacramental presence
must destroy his natural mode of existence
and reduce him to a passive,
helpless state of being in the host.
But this is only because he fails to
conceive the Catholic doctrine that
our Lord is present both in heaven
and also in the host at the same
time, though in two different modes.
He says, "He is present with us, we
adore that presence, but he is passive
and lifeless in the hands of a priesthood.
No sign or word comes from
the pix. When the church is in
travail over a new doctrine, recluse
and learned men busy themselves in
vast libraries in order to catch the
<i>consensus</i> of Catholic tradition. A
believer may be excused, if, like
Mary, he cries out, 'They have
taken away the Lord, and I know
not where they have laid him!'"
Strange language this from a member
of the communion of Andrewes,
Hooker, Taylor, Pusey, and Hobart!
Has the author ever read their glowing
words respecting this same
theme? Is he familiar with the doctrinal
books of his own church?
Taken away the Lord, when he remains
perpetually in our tabernacles
awaiting the visits of those true believers
who pass hours in sweet communion
at the foot of the altar, conversing
with him as with the friend
and spouse of their souls? When he
is given to them in communion and
his sacred body rests in their bosoms,
kindling there the flames of a sacred
love often equal to that which glows
in the seraphim? Let the reverend
doctor read the lives of the saints,
and ask them if the Lord is silent
when they converse with him in the
blessed sacrament, or let him even
ask the ordinary pious Catholic that
question. He does not indeed break
the silence of his hidden state by
words audible to the bodily ear, but
he speaks far more efficaciously to
the heart in a way which is unintelligible
to cold rationalism, but perfectly
well known to faith inflamed by
love. The divine eucharist was not
instituted as a medium for communicating
light to the church concerning
revealed truths. Christ teaches
and rules the church by the Holy
Spirit, and not by his human voice.
It is his will that study, meditation,
and counsel should be the means by
which the prelates and doctors of the
church obtain the light and assistance
of this divine Spirit. Dr. Harwood
is not pleased with this arrangement;
but as the Lord appears to have determined
definitely that it must be so,
we are afraid that his suggestions will
not be attended to. At all events, he
may console himself with the reflection
that he has discovered an entirely new
objection to the Catholic doctrine.</p>

<p>We have unwittingly passed over
one other objection, namely, that
the doctrine of the eucharistic sacrifice
destroys the idea of communion.
The eucharist does not cease to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
a sacrament by being a sacrifice. If
there is communion among Episcopalians
through a reception of bread
and wine, it would seem that there
might be also communion among
Catholics in receiving the true body
and blood of Christ. If the Protestant
Episcopal liturgy is a common
prayer, certainly the Catholic liturgy
is equally one, though it is also a sacrifice.
Moreover, there is, in the
strictest sense, communion in the
very act of offering the sacrifice.
The priest, though consecrated by a
heavenly grace and commissioned by
the divine authority of our Lord, is
consecrated to minister for the people,
in their name and as their representative.
He offers up the sacrifice
for the people, and they offer sacrifice
to God through him, which is signified
in the mass by the action of the
deacon, who, as the representative
of the laity, holds the pixis in his
hand at the offertory, and placing his
right hand on the foot of the chalice,
recites with the priest the prayer, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Offerimus
tibi, Domine, calicem</i>, etc.
We will not attempt to prove the
truth of the Catholic doctrine of the
mass, since the author does not directly
attempt to disprove it, but will
drop the subject here, and proceed
to notice what method he proposes
to follow in refuting the two grand
Catholic doctrines of the papacy and
the mass.</p>

<p>The reverend doctor takes a review
of the condition of Protestantism
as in contrast with that of the Catholic
Church, in which we are happy
to be able to concur with him as well
as to commend the graphic power of
his description. He then briefly indicates
three ways of proceeding:
one by tradition, one by tradition
and Scripture together, and one by
Scripture alone, which he selects, reserving
the right to appeal to tradition
when it is convenient. We will let
his language speak for itself:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As searchers after truth, we must acknowledge
some standard and appeal to
some recognized authority. Without this we
must follow either our own mental bias, or
else become the prey of every man who
shall be bold enough to declare that he has
and holds the truth of God. I fear very
much we have lost sight of this need of appeal
to a recognized standard of truth and
duty. We are, in this new age, building
apparently on the sand; or it would seem
that what we had supposed to be rock, on
which many were building, has become pulverized,
and as the sands shift under the
power of the stream, multitudes believe to-day
what they did not believe yesterday,
and to-morrow they may believe nothing at
all.</p>

<p>"I touch here a serious evil which is doing
more harm to our Protestantism than
any direct assaults of Romanism. We seem
to be under some spell. Our spiritual
ideas are resolving themselves into a series
of dissolving views; and all because the
mind has not the proper nutriment to impart
health and vigor to our religious feelings
and convictions. Upon every account
it becomes us to recognize the fact that in
religion we must have an actual, definite
standard of appeal. This we must find
either in sacred Scripture or in tradition,
or in both combined. If we accept the tradition
of the church as law, we might as
well abandon the contest with Rome, because
the traditions gradually, as they gather
force and headway in time, revolve
around the papacy. The traditions in the
long run have made the papacy; they are
its chief support to-day. To accept them
bodily, in mass, is to appeal to actual Christendom&mdash;to
the historic church&mdash;as to a
standard and law, and not as to a <em>witness</em> of
truth. It is to acknowledge the identity of
Christian truth and the Christian Church
visible. This brings us again to Romanism,
or this is the postulate of the Roman
Catholic apologist.</p>

<p>"If to-day I ask <em>what is truth?</em> and if I allow
every church or sect to answer, I am
stunned by a confused and unintelligible
noise. If I allow one church to answer,
and only one, in the midst of the crowd of
churches, by my procedure I submit myself,
in advance, to that one church. But if I allow
none to answer for me, and I recognize,
nevertheless, a divine historic revelation, I
am compelled to go to sacred Scripture in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
order to learn what God requires me to believe.
Shall we take the sacred Scripture
fashioned by Italian workmen? or by
Greek, or by Anglican, or by German,
or by American workmen? No; but the
text in its purity and simplicity. Here
we must take our stand whensoever we
come to the question of what it is necessary
to believe in order to be a Christian;
whensoever, in a word, loyalty and the
obedience of faith are required or even considered.</p>

<p>"I do not mean, however, to deny and repudiate
utterly the traditional principle.
Christianity is historic. As a social interest,
as an organized spiritual fact, it comes
to us from the past. We cannot dismiss
this past of Christian life and history, any
more than we can dismiss the past of our
civil life and institutions. The new generation,
as it succeeds the old, does not build
again from the foundations. A. U. C. represented
a fact to the Roman citizen which
he never could forget. We measure time
in the world's history by the letters A. D.
We date our public documents in the United
States from the declaration of our independence.
We do not create the state
anew; we administer it as an existing fact.
So in religion. Many things, many words,
institutions, and the like have come to us
from the past, which we accept and use as
a matter of course. We baptize infants,
we observe the first day of the week, we
use the imposition of hands in ordination
and confirmation, we employ the words
sacrament, trinity, incarnation, etc., in theology.
This is an illustration of the recognition
of a traditional principle which is inevitable.
We do not, therefore, maintain
that we must have a sure and certain warrant
of Scripture for all that we may observe
and do as Christians, because it is impossible
to be confined to the written word
under all circumstances, and during all
ages. Much is left the conscience and
judgment of individuals and of particular
churches; but when we come to faith, to
what it is necessary to believe as Christians,
we must adhere firmly to the Bible,
and never for a moment allow any one to
impose upon the conscience any thing, as
requisite to a true reception of the Gospel,
which is not contained therein, nor may be
proved thereby.</p>

<p>"This, then, is our standard of appeal.
Logically and morally it is the right and
only standard of appeal in the discussion,
especially of the claims and teachings of
any and of every church whatsoever. If
this be not the tribunal to which we must
go, then we must have recourse to the dictum
of a church, and then, as we have seen,
we allow a church to be its own standard
of appeal. Consequently, when Rome proclaims
her infallibility, we must allow her
claim. When the Church of England disowns
infallibility, we may or may not accept
her disclaimer. If we do <em>not</em> accept it,
then we prove her to be <em>fallible</em>, to be mistaken
articulately in respect of her own
quality and prerogative. We are reduced
to absurdity.</p>

<p>"We are forced back to sacred Scripture,
and in the interests of Christian truth we are
compelled to take our stand here. And I
declare in all completeness of conviction,
that with the Bible in our hands we are triumphant
against the doctrine of the supremacy
of the pope, and of the sacrifice of the
mass. This is to be triumphant against
Romanism."</p></blockquote>

<p>Dr. Harwood is sagacious enough
not to follow the example of the
generality of his Episcopalian associates,
which the Presbyterians have
been lately seduced by their evil genius
into following, that is, to appeal
to the first six councils. He probably
agrees with the author of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liber Librorum</i>
and Dr. Stanley, that in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
200 we find the thing he is opposing
and anxious to escape from, existing.
"How, then, came such an institution
into existence? For nothing
can be plainer than that about
a hundred years after the death of
John <em>it appears</em>, although in any thing
but apostolic garb. All is altered."
"No other change," says Dean Stanley,
"equally momentous has ever
since affected its fortunes; yet none
has ever been so silent and secret.
The church has now become history,
the history not of an isolated community
or of isolated individuals, but of
an organized society, incorporated
with the political systems of the
world."... "Hard is it to see in
such a church any thing but a profound
mystery of God, a mystery of
spiritual evil, a mystery of iniquity."<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
Dr. Harwood feels it to be necessary
to take refuge in the obscure period
between the year 100 and the year
200 as in a chasm separating historical
from scriptural Christianity. It is
very easy to make a theory concerning
the silent, sudden change which
took place during this century, and
then, clearing history by a bound, to
land in the New Testament. Once
there, with full liberty of private interpretation,
which means freedom to
interpret it by the light of any philosophical
theory or preconceived opinions
one may choose to adopt, Dr.
Harwood thinks he is safe, and able
to defend himself to the end against
Romanism. He imagines that we
are unwilling and unable to follow
him there, and meet him&mdash;or rather
the champions of his cause&mdash;on their
own chosen ground. "In conclusion,
we will ask you to remember
that the Roman Catholics have never
liked our appeal to Scripture. They
do not like it to-day any better than
they liked it three hundred years
ago." If the doctor thinks we are
afraid of the Scriptures, or in any way
distrustful of our ability to prove our
doctrines from it, he is extremely mistaken.
We have always been ready
to enter into that part of the argument,
and we maintain specifically
respecting the two grand doctrines
of the papacy and the mass that
they can be fully and satisfactorily
proved from Scripture, as in point of
fact they have been proved, to mention
no others, by Mr. Allies and
Cardinal Wiseman. We object to
the demand that Scripture should be
the only source of appeal, not because
we are afraid that we shall be
defeated by scriptural arguments; but
because the demand is unjust, and
the assumption on which it is founded
is baseless. We demand that the
subject shall be discussed in all its
bearings, on all its grounds, by the
light of all the knowledge that is attained
from every source. We deny
the ability of our adversaries to establish
the authority of Scripture without
first assuming Catholic principles,
and we deny their logical and moral
right after using these principles in
establishing Scripture, to throw away
or burn their ladder by denying or
ignoring these same principles when
it is a question of establishing the
sense of the Scripture, explaining or
integrating its statements. If we are
to shut out of our minds all the ideas
of Christianity which are extraneous
to the literal statements of the New
Testament, to take the attitude of
learners searching after truth, and to
get from the naked text without
other interpreter than itself the sense
that is in it, we have a difficult task
of doubtful issue before us. John
Locke, who was probably as capable
of doing this impartially as any Englishman
can be, tried it, and proclaimed
as the result of his studies
that only one idea is demonstrably
revealed in the New Testament,
namely, that Jesus Christ is the prophet
of God to whose teaching and
precepts obedience is due. As to his
actual teaching and precepts, he
could only find probability, concluding,
therefore, very justly, that there
is no system of doctrine or code of
precepts clearly binding upon all
alike, each one being left to the guidance
of a probable conscience only.</p>

<p>It is very difficult, if not impossible,
to read the New Testament without
spectacles. For our own part, we are
quite sure that the New Testament
contains more or less explicitly all the
principal and many of the minor
Catholic doctrines, and that the sense
given by the church is the one given
by true exegesis and criticism. Yet
we will not venture to say how far we
should be able to see this without
Catholic spectacles. We are quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
sure that Dr. Harwood also has a
pair of spectacles, and cannot lay
them aside if he would. We find in
point of fact, that ordinarily persons
who believe in the Bible and read it
all their lives, whether Episcopalians,
Presbyterians, or even Unitarians, are
seldom startled out of the belief they
have been taught, and convinced of
some different interpretation, merely
by reading it. It is evident, therefore,
that any one exposition made of
Christianity from the simple text will
never be a demonstration in the view
of all candid, sincere persons. There
will always be various interpretations
having more or less probability, and
unity will never be reached. Besides
this, the degree and extent of inspiration
will never be settled, or the limits
between the human, transitory element
and the divine, unchangeable
element become fixed. The result
will be that we must fall back
on philosophy and a system of
rationalism. Let it be conceded
that the ideas in the mind of each
sacred writer when he wrote are
clearly apprehended, it will be impossible
to secure perfect submission
even to the teachings of inspired
men, when the principle of church
authority has been cast to the winds.
This is the reason why, even at the
outset of an argument, and before we
are entitled to cite the authority of
tradition as divine to one who denies
it, we refuse to permit the case to
be argued on the scriptural ground
alone, even though both parties admit
the divine authority of Scripture.
We desire to do something more
than to make a good case, and to
establish our interpretation as even
the more probable or the most probable.
We desire to prove it to a
demonstration which does not leave
even a slight probability on the other
side, through which an adversary may
creep. We wish to have the question
adjudicated and decided, so that it
may be clear and indisputable that
God has revealed and commands all
men to believe and obey the Gospel
of his Son as a distinct and positive
law of faith and practice, and not as
a mere theory. We are not afraid,
however, that we cannot get the best
of it, in a discussion of the text of the
New Testament, conducted on the
same principles that we should apply
to an ancient manuscript about whose
contents we have no extrinsic light
whatever. Those who come nearest
to this cold, critical impartiality are
men who possess the intellectual
keenness necessary to see into ideas
as they are, without having any
motive to misrepresent them. One
who is indifferent as to the question
what the sacred writers thought and
intended to say, because he considers
their teaching as equivalent only to
that of Socrates or Confucius, and
who is qualified to examine critically
the New Testament, will at least
attempt to state impartially what impression
it has made on his mind.
And that statement will throw some
light on the question, What does the
text clearly and unmistakably signify
by itself, apart from ideas on the same
subject-matter which are derived from
Christian tradition? One person of
this kind, Mr. Samuel Johnson, of
Lynn, Massachusetts, who is a leader
among the Bostonian free-thinkers,
in an article which appeared in <cite>The
Radical</cite> gave his opinion that the
doctrine of the papacy is clearly contained
in St. Matthew's Gospel. The
infidel Jew Salvador, in a work whose
name we do not now remember, but
which we have attentively read, declares
that the Roman Catholic religion
is the genuine religion of the
New Testament, and that Protestantism
is a total misconception of Christianity;
an opinion we have ourselves
personally heard expressed by a well-informed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
and zealous Israelite of our
acquaintance. We do not care to
press these testimonies too far; but
at all events they indicate, in connection
with the fact that so many
learned students of the Bible, both
Protestant and Catholic, interpret it
in a manner quite different from that
of Dr. Harwood's school, that it does
not on the face of it clearly and unmistakably
pronounce in his favor or
against us.</p>

<p>We insist then, further, that even
conceding Dr. Harwood for a moment
in possession of the ground on
which his belief of the divine authority
of the Scripture stands, he is
bound to admit all the light that ecclesiastical
history throws back on its
text, as he himself partially but inconsistently
admits, and as all Protestants
have ever done so far as it
suited their purposes to do so. We
may illustrate this by a parallel case.
A Christian discusses the text of the
Old Testament with a Jew. If the
Jew should insist on sticking to the
text, and interpreting the prophecies
exclusively by biblical criticism, the
Christian could justly insist that the
facts of the life of Jesus Christ and
the history of Christianity must be
considered. The Jew himself would
not fail to cite all kinds of historical
facts not prejudicial to himself against
an infidel, as manifesting the sense
and fulfilment of the prophecies.
Let the Jew shut his eyes to the
miracles proving the divine mission
and miraculous conception of Jesus,
and he can very plausibly explain the
famous prediction, "Behold the Virgin
(ha almah) shall conceive," etc., as
signifying. "Behold <em>this young woman</em>"&mdash;that
is, one standing by and
pointed out by Isaias&mdash;shall conceive
and bear a son. So, with all the Messianic
passages of the Old Testament,
as one may see by consulting Rabbi
Leeser's English translation, with
notes, published at Philadelphia.
Now, it is a perfectly fair and conclusive
argument against a Jew to
show that the history of Jesus, established
on merely human faith, presents
such a correspondence to the
prophecies of the Old Testament that
it must be regarded as their fulfilment.
Although the Old Testament
alone might not reveal Jesus to his
individual reason, yet in the light of
his life it is shown that these ancient
Scriptures testify of him. It is not
competent for him to allege his Scripture
as a complete and finished revelation,
rejecting every thing which is
not clearly visible on its face; for
we can show him that his Scriptures
point out the glorious son of David's
royal daughter as the one who will
carry out the dispensation of Moses
to its consummation.</p>

<p>It is precisely the same case between
us and Protestants. We
point to the church as presenting
historical facts and verities corresponding
to the somewhat obscure
predictions or other declarations of
the Scripture, and manifesting their
significance. We show how all that
can be learned from the New Testament
by itself is in harmony with
what the church proclaims herself to
be, and declares true Christianity to
consist in; and we show the Scripture
presupposes, provides for, and points
toward the church. If we take all
those passages which relate to the
divine eucharist, and place beside
them the traditional teaching and practice
of the church, we see them at
once lit up with meaning and irradiating
our minds with the true and
Catholic doctrine. One is the explanation
of the other, and the historical
existence of the sacrifice of the mass
confronted with the language of the
Scripture demonstrates that it must
be the thing which the sacred writers
meant. We take the prediction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
our Lord to St. Peter, "Thou art
Peter, and on this rock I will build
my church." One who knows nothing
about the Catholic Church might
easily be persuaded that our Lord
meant no more than this: "Thou
art firm like a rock in thy faith, and
upon such a firm faith I will establish
all the elect who are an invisible society
known to me, and these Satan
shall never be able to overcome."
But when that stupendous, world-subduing
might of Peter's see which
overawes even Dr. Harwood is contemplated
in history as it emerges
from the obscure dawn of the Christian
era, and goes forward through
all time conquering and to conquer,
its plain correspondence to and fulfilment
of the literal significance of
our Lord's words proves conclusively
that he meant this, and nothing else.
We do not intend, however, to go
into this argument any further, as
Dr. Harwood does not profess to
argue the point himself. All we aim
at is, to show that the argument must
be conducted on the ground of history
as well as that of Scripture.
And here we desire to call attention
to an admirable article by President
Woolsey in the same number of the
<cite>New-Englander</cite>, in which Dr. Harwood's
lecture was first published, on
the <i>Church of the Future</i>, which exhibits
with rare ability the very idea
we are insisting upon, that the true
Christianity is the genuine historical
Christianity.</p>

<p>The only true issue which can be
made is respecting the genuine, historical
development of the Christian
idea. Dr. Harwood and his school
cannot escape from this. If, therefore,
the champions whom he summons
to the controversy respond to
his call, they will be bound to demonstrate
historically that the papal
supremacy was a purely human invention
substituted for the authentic
constitution which the apostles gave
to the Christian church. This Dr.
Harwood thinks can be done. "If
the pope be that rock, we can find
by the lights of history the strata
and the law of its structure. We observe
it acquired shape and size&mdash;and
there is a hammer which can break it
in pieces." If there is such a hammer,
we wonder that it has not yet
been found and wielded. In our
opinion, the enemies of the papacy
have already said every thing which
can be said on their side of the question.
We are at a loss to know how
history can be made to give up any
thing new on the subject, any thing
which has not been already thoroughly
sifted and discussed. We are perfectly
willing that our adversaries should
try again to look up or manufacture
a hammer with which to try the effect
of their blows upon the Rock of
Peter. We think they will find that
they are undertaking a herculean
task. One thing only we must be
permitted to observe, that any one
who undertakes this controversy
ought not to ignore and pass by what
has already been written by Catholic
controversialists. It is not fair that
the discussion should be always beginning
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de novo</i>, and Catholic writers
be required to repeat all the labor of
their predecessors. If Dr. Harwood,
or any one else, is disposed to attempt
our demolition, let him first
master all the arguments and evidences
which have been already adduced
on our side, give a distinct
answer to them, and rebut the answers
which we have already made
to anti-papal arguments. Whoever
does this with competent learning
and ability, will no doubt receive due
attention; but until this is done, it
will be quite sufficient for us to challenge
a refutation of the works of
our champions which hitherto have
remained unanswered, and which we
confidently affirm to be unanswerable.</p>

<h2>HAYDN'S STRUGGLE AND TRIUMPH.</h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>"Seventeen kreutzers for a morning's
work!" exclaimed a pretty but
slovenly-dressed young woman, standing
at the door of an apartment in a
mean-looking house in one of the
narrow streets of Vienna, addressing
a man of low stature and sallow
complexion, who had just come in.
"And the printers running after you
ever since you went out! Profitless
doings for you to spend your time!
At eight, the singing-desk of the
brothers De la Merci; at ten, Count
de Haugwitz's chapel; grand mass
at eleven; and all this toil for a few
kreutzers!"</p>

<p>"What can I do?" said the weary,
desponding man.</p>

<p>"Do! Give up this foolish business
of music, and take to something
that will enable you to live. Did
not my father, a hair-dresser, give you
shelter when you had only your garret
and skylight, and had to lie in
bed and write for want of coals?
Had he not a right to expect you
would dress his daughter as well as
she had been used at home, and
that she should have servants to wait
on her, as in her father's house?"</p>

<p>"You should not reproach me,
Nanny. Have I not worked till my
health has given way? If fortune is
inexorable&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fortune! As if fortune did not
always wait upon industry in a proper
calling. Your patrons admire
and applaud, but they will not <em>pay</em>;
yet you <em>will</em> drudge away your life
in this ungrateful occupation. I tell
you, Joseph Haydn, music is not the
thing!"</p>

<p>Here a knock was heard at the
door; and the wife, with exclamations
of impatience, flounced away.
The unfortunate artist threw himself
on a seat, and leaned his head on a
table covered with notes of music.
So entirely had he yielded himself to
despondency that he did not move,
even when the door opened, till the
sound of a well-known voice close at
his side startled him from his melancholy
reverie.</p>

<p>"How now, Haydn! what is the
matter, my boy?"</p>

<p>The speaker was an old man, shabbily
dressed, but with something striking
and even commanding in his noble
features. His large, dark, flashing
eyes, his olive complexion, and the
contour of his face bespoke him a
native of a sunnier clime than that
of Germany. Haydn sprang up and
welcomed him with a cordial embrace.</p>

<p>"And when, my dear Porpora,
did you return to Vienna?" he asked.</p>

<p>"This morning only; and my first
care was to find you out. But how
is this? I find you thin, and pale,
and gloomy. Where are your spirits?"</p>

<p>"Gone," murmured the composer,
and dropped his eyes on the floor.
His visitor regarded him with a look
of affectionate interest.</p>

<p>In answer to Porpora's inquiries,
Haydn told him of the struggles and
failures by which he had been led to
doubt his own genius, till he had
succumbed under the crushing hand
of poverty. "I am chained," he
concluded bitterly; and, giving way
to the anguish of his heart, he burst
into tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>Porpora shook his head, and was
silent for a few moments. At length
he said:</p>

<p>"I must, I see, give you a little
of my experience. I was, you know,
a pupil of Scarlatti more fortunate
than you; for my works procured me
almost at once a wide-spread fame.
I was called for not only in Venice,
but in Vienna and London."</p>

<p>"Ah! yours was a brilliant lot,"
cried the young composer, looking
up with kindling eyes.</p>

<p>"The Saxon court," continued Porpora,
"offered me the direction of the
chapel and of the theatre at Dresden.
Even the princesses received my lessons;
in short, my success was so
great that I awakened the jealousy
of Hasse himself. All this you know,
and how I returned to London upon
the invitation of amateurs in Italian
music."</p>

<p>"Where you rivalled Handel!" said
Haydn enthusiastically. "Handel,
with all his greatness, had no versatility.
Your sacred music, Porpora, will
live when your theatrical compositions
have ceased to enjoy unrivalled
popularity."</p>

<p>"My sacred compositions may survive
and carry my name to posterity;
for taste in such things is less mutable
than in the opera. You see now,
dear Haydn, for what I have lived
and labored. I was once renowned
and wealthy. What did prosperity
bring me? Envy, discontent, rivalship,
disappointment! Would you
know to what period I can look back
with self-approbation, with thankfulness?
To the toil of early years;
to the struggle after an ideal of greatness,
goodness, and beauty; to the
self-forgetfulness that saw only the
glorious goal far, far before me; to
the undismayed resolve that sought
only its attainment. Or to a time
still later, when the visions of manhood's
impure and selfish ambition
had faded away, when the soul had
shaken off some of her fetters, and
roused herself to a perception of the
eternal, the perfect, the divine; when
I became conscious of the delusive
vanity of earthly hopes and earthly
excellence, but at the same time
awakened to the revelation of that
which cannot die!</p>

<p>"You see me now, seventy-three
years old, and too poor to command
even a shelter for the few days that
yet remain to me in this world. I
have lost the splendid fame I once
possessed; I have lost the riches that
were mine; I have lost the power
to win even a competence by my
own labors; but I have not lost my
passion for our glorious music, nor
enjoyment of the reward she bestows
on her votaries; nor my confidence
in Heaven. And you, at twenty-seven,
you&mdash;more greatly endowed, to
whom the world is open&mdash;<em>you</em> despair!
Are you worthy to succeed,
O man of little faith?"</p>

<p>"My friend, my benefactor!" cried
the young artist, clasping his hand
with deep emotion.</p>

<p>"Cast away your bonds; cut and
rend, if your very flesh is torn in the
effort; and the ground once spurned,
you are free. What have you been
doing?" And he turned over rapidly
the musical notes that lay on the
table. "Here, what is this&mdash;a symphony?
Play it for me, if you please."</p>

<p>So saying, with a gentle force he
led his young friend to the piano,
and Haydn played from the piece he
had nearly completed.</p>

<p>"This is excellent, admirable!"
cried Porpora, when he rose from the
instrument. "When can you finish
this? for I must have it at once."</p>

<p>"To-morrow, if you like," answered
the composer more cheerfully.</p>

<p>"To-morrow then; and you must
work to-night. I will go and order
you a physician; he will come to-morrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
morning&mdash;how madly your
pulse throbs!&mdash;and when your work
is done, you may rest. Adieu for
the present." And pressing his
young friend's hands, the eccentric
but benevolent old man departed,
leaving Haydn full of new thoughts,
his bosom fired with zeal to struggle
against adverse fortune. In such
moods does the spiritual champion
wrestle with the powers of the abyss,
and mightily prevail.</p>

<p>When Haydn, late that night,
threw himself on his bed, weary, ill,
and exhausted, his frame racked with
the pains of fever, he had accomplished
the first of an order of works destined
to endear his name to all succeeding
time.</p>

<p>While the artist lay on a sick-bed,
a brilliant <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</i> was given by Count
Mortzin, an Austrian nobleman of immense
wealth and influence, at which
the most distinguished individuals in
Vienna were present. The musical
entertainments given by these luxurious
patrons of the arts were at that
time, and for some years after, the
most splendid in Europe.</p>

<p>When the concert was over, Prince
Antoine Esterhazy expressed the pleasure
he had received, and his obligations
to the noble host. "Chief
among your magnificent novelties,"
said he, "is the new symphony, <i>St.
Maria</i>. One does not hear every
day such music. Who is the composer?"</p>

<p>The count referred to one of his
friends. The answer was, "Joseph
Haydn."</p>

<p>"I have heard his quartettos; he
is no common artist. Is he in your
service, count?"</p>

<p>"He has been employed by me."</p>

<p>"With your good leave, he shall
be transferred to ours; and I shall
take care he has no reason to regret
the change. Let him be presented
to us."</p>

<p>There was a murmur among the
audience and a movement, but the
composer did not appear; and presently
word was brought to his highness
that the young man on whom
he intended to confer so great an
honor was detained at home by illness.</p>

<p>"So! Let him be brought to me as
soon as he recovers; he shall enter
my service. I like his symphony
vastly. Your pardon, count; for we
will rob you of your best man." And
the great prince, having decided the
destiny of a greater than himself,
turned to those who surrounded him
to speak of other matters.</p>

<p>News of the change in his fortune
was brought to Haydn by his friend
Porpora; and so renovating was the
effect of hope that he was strong
enough on the following day to pay
his respects to his illustrious patron.
His highness was just preparing to
ride, but would see the composer;
and he was conducted through a
splendid suite of rooms to the apartment
where the proud head of the
Esterhazys deigned to receive an
almost nameless artist. The prince,
in the splendid array suited to his
rank, glanced somewhat carelessly at
the low, slight figure that stood before
him, and said, as he was presented,
"Is this, then, the composer of the
music I heard last night?"</p>

<p>"This is he&mdash;Joseph Haydn," replied
the friend who introduced him.</p>

<p>"So&mdash;a Moor, I should judge from
his dark complexion. And you write
such music? Haydn&mdash;I recollect
the name; and I remember hearing,
too, that you were not well paid for
your labors, eh?"</p>

<p>"I have been very unfortunate,
your highness&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, you shall have no reason
to complain in my service. My
secretary shall fix your appointments;
and name whatever else you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
desire. All of your profession find
me liberal. Now then, sir Moor,
you may go; and let it be your first
care to provide yourself with a new
coat, a wig, and buckles and heels to
your shoes. I will have you respectable
in appearance as well as in talents;
so let me have no more of
shabby professors. And do your best,
my little dusky, to recruit in flesh&mdash;it
will add to the stature; and to relieve
your olive with a shade of the
ruddy. Such spindle masters would
be a walking discredit to our larder,
which is truly a spendthrift one."</p>

<p>So saying, with a laugh, the haughty
nobleman dismissed his new dependent.
The artist chafed not at
the imperious tone of patronage; for
he did not yet feel the superiority of
his own vocation. It was the bondage-time
of genius; the wings were
not yet grown which were to bear his
spirit up, when it brooded over a
new world.</p>

<p>The life which Haydn led in the
service of Prince Esterhazy, to which
service he was permanently attached
by Nicolas, the successor of Antoine,
in the quality of chapel-master, was
one so easy that it might have
proved fatal to an artist more inclined
to luxury and pleasure, or less devoted
to his art. Now for the first
time relieved from the care of the future,
he was enabled to yield to the
impulse of his genius, and create
works which gradually extended his
fame over all the countries of Europe.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>On the evening of a day in the beginning
of April, 1809, all the lovers
of art in Vienna were assembled in
the theatre to witness the performance
of the oratorio of <i>The Creation</i>.
The entertainment had been
given in honor of the composer of
that noble work&mdash;the illustrious
Haydn&mdash;by his numerous friends and
admirers. He had been enticed
from Gumpendorf, his retreat in the
suburbs, the cottage surrounded by a
little garden which he had purchased
after his retirement from the Esterhazy
service, and where he was
spending the last years of his life.
Three hundred musicians assisted at
the performance. The audience rose
<i>en masse</i> and greeted with rapturous
applause the white-haired man, who,
led forward by the most distinguished
nobles in the city, was conducted to
the place of honor. There, seated
with princesses at his right hand,
beauty smiling upon him, the centre
of a circle of nobility, the observed
and admired of all, the object of
the acclamations of thousands&mdash;who
would not have said that Haydn had
reached the summit of human greatness,
had more than realized the
proudest visions of his youth? His
serene countenance, his clear eye, his
air of dignified self-possession, showed
that prosperity had not overcome
him, but that amid the smiles of fortune
he had not forgotten the true
excellence of man.</p>

<p>"I can see plainly," remarked one
of Haydn's friends, whom we will call
Manuel, "that he will write no more."</p>

<p>"He has done enough; and now
we are ready for the farewell of
Haydn," said another.</p>

<p>"The farewell?"</p>

<p>"Did you never hear the story?
I have heard him tell it often myself.
It concerns one of his most celebrated
symphonies. The occasion was
this: Among the musicians attached
to the service of Prince Esterhazy,
were several who, during his sojourn
upon his estates, were obliged to
leave their wives at Vienna. At one
time his highness prolonged his stay
at Esterhazy castle considerably beyond
the usual period. The disconsolate
husbands entreated Haydn to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
become the interpreter of their wishes.
Thus the idea came to him of composing
a symphony in which each
instrument ceased, one after another.
He added at the close of every part
the direction, 'Here the light is extinguished.'
Each musician, in his
turn, rose, put out his candle, rolled
up his notes, and went away. This
pantomime had the desired effect; the
next morning the prince gave orders
for their return to the capital.</p>

<p>"He used to tell us a somewhat
similar story of the origin of his
Turkish or military symphony. You
know the high appreciation he met
with in his visits to England; but
notwithstanding the praise and homage
he received, he could not prevent
the enthusiastic audience from falling
asleep during the performance of his
compositions. It occurred to him to
devise a kind of ingenious revenge.
In this piece, while the current is
gliding softly, and slumber beginning
to steal over the senses of his audience,
a sudden and unexpected burst
of martial music, tremendous as a
thunder-peal, startles the surprised
sleepers into active attention. I
would have liked to see the lethargic
islanders, with their eyes
and mouths thrown open by such
an unlooked-for shock!"</p>

<p>A stop was suddenly put to the
conversation by the commencement
of the performance. <i>The Creation</i>,
the first of Haydn's oratorios, was regarded
as his greatest work, and had
often elicited the most heartfelt applause.
Now that the aged and
honored composer was present, probably
for the last time, to hear it, an
emotion too deep for utterance seemed
to pervade the vast audience.
The feeling was too reverential to be
expressed by the ordinary tokens of
pleasure. It seemed as if every eye
in the assembly were fixed on the
calm, noble face of the venerated artist;
as if every heart beat with love
for him. Then came, like a succession
of heavenly melodies, the music
of <i>The Creation</i>, and the listeners felt
as if transported back to the infancy
of the world. At the words, "Let
there be light, and there was light,"
when all the instruments were united
in one full burst of gorgeous harmony,
emotion seemed to shake the
whole frame of the aged artist. His
pale face crimsoned; his bosom
heaved convulsively; he raised his
eyes, streaming with tears, toward
heaven, and, lifting upward his trembling
hands, exclaimed, his voice audible
in the pause of the music, "Not
unto me&mdash;not unto me&mdash;but unto
thy name be all the glory, O Lord!"</p>

<p>From this moment Haydn lost the
calmness and serenity that had marked
the expression of his countenance.
The very depths of his heart had
been stirred, and ill could his wasted
strength sustain the tide of feeling.
When the superb chorus at the close
of the second part announced the
completion of the work of creation,
he could bear the excitement no
longer. Assisted by the prince's
physician and several of his friends,
he was carried from the theatre,
pausing to give one last look of gratitude,
expressed in his tearful eyes, to
the orchestra who had so nobly executed
his conception, and followed
by the lengthened plaudits of the
spectators, who felt that they were
never to look upon his face again.</p>

<p>Some weeks after this occurrence,
his friend Manuel, who had sent to
inquire after his health, received from
him a card on which he had written,
to notes of music, the words, "<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Meine
kraft ist dahin</i>," "My strength is
gone." Haydn was in the habit of
sending about these cards, but his
increased feebleness was evident in
the handwriting of this; and Manuel
lost no time in hastening to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
There, in his quiet cottage, around
which rolled the thunders of war, terrifying
others but not him, sat the
venerable composer. His desk stood
on one side, on the other his piano;
he smiled, and held out his hand to
greet his friend.</p>

<p>"Many a time," he murmured,
"you have cheered my solitude, and
now you have come to see the old
man die."</p>

<p>"Speak not thus, my dear friend,"
cried Manuel, grieved to the heart;
"you will recover."</p>

<p>"Not here," answered Haydn, and
pointed upward.</p>

<p>He then made a sign to one of his
attendants to open the desk, and
reach him a roll of papers. From
these he took one and gave it to his
friend. It was inscribed in his own
hand, "Catalogue of all my musical
compositions, which I can remember,
since my eighteenth year. Vienna,
4th December, 1805." Manuel, as
he read it, understood the mute pressure
of his friend's hand, and sighed
deeply. That hand would never
trace another note.</p>

<p>"Better thus," said Haydn softly,
"than a lingering old age of care,
disease, perhaps of poverty! No; I
am happy. I have lived not in vain.
I have accomplished my destiny; I
have done good. I am ready for
thy call, O Master!"</p>

<p>His spiritual adviser and guide was
with him the next hour, and administered
the last consolations of religion.
The aged man was wrapped in devotion.
At length he asked to be supported
to his piano; it was opened,
and as his trembling fingers touched
the keys, an expression of rapture
was kindled in his eyes. The music
that answered his touch seemed the
music of inspiration. But it gradually
faded away; the flush gave place
to a deadly pallor; and while his fingers
still rested on the keys, he sank
back into the arms of his friend, and
gently breathed out his parting spirit.
It passed as in a happy strain of
melody!</p>

<p>Prince Esterhazy did honor to the
memory of his departed friend by the
pageant of funeral ceremonies. His
remains were transported to Eisenstadt,
in Hungary, and placed in
the Franciscan vault. The prince
also purchased, at a high price, all
his books and manuscripts, and the
numerous medals he had obtained.
But his fame belongs to the world;
and in all hearts sensible to the music
of truth and nature is consecrated
the memory of Haydn.</p>

<h2>THE IMMUTABILITY OF THE SPECIES.<br />

II.</h2>

<p>Of the several circumstances which
led to the conception of the theory
here advanced, the first and most important
was the recognition of the fact
that variation was left unaccounted
for upon the hypothesis of evolution.
Here, if anywhere, we conceived,
was to be found the vulnerable part
of Darwinism. It occurred to us
that the probabilities were that a
theory was false when it had for its
data phenomena which conform to
no law. Our subsequent inquiries
furnished us with nothing by which
to rebut this presumption; but with
much to confirm it. Our suspicion
at last strengthened into conviction,
and we became confident that contemplation
of the subject of the
cause of variation alone could furnish
us with a solution of the whole question.</p>

<p>It is of laws alone of which we
speak in these articles. All the facts
adduced by Darwin we accept, and
use them merely as illustrations. We
have nothing in common with those
who contend that the refutation of
Darwinism lies solely with mere compilers
of facts&mdash;fanciers, florists, and
breeders. Darwin has heretofore anticipated
nothing but a joinder of
issue upon facts. He has apparently
never contemplated being met by a
demurrer. He has endeavored to
confound his opponents by a vast
multitude of facts; and, owing to his
reverence for whatever has the sanction
of antiquity, it has never entered
his mind that any one would be so
presumptuous as to demur to the
time-honored conception of <em>new
growth</em>, upon which these facts are
based. Of this presumption we are
guilty when we deny the very existence
of organic evolution.</p>

<p>In the preceding article we directly
intimated, on several occasions, that
no theory other than that of reversion
can afford a solution of the mystery
of the appearance of favorable modifications.
As some little diversity of
opinion exists respecting Darwin's
views on the subject of the cause of
variation, it may be well for us to
dwell awhile on this question, and to
furnish some evidence substantiating
our statement.</p>

<p>Darwin, in his <i>Origin of Species</i>,
candidly and frankly admits that he
can assign no satisfactory reason for
the appearance of favorable modifications.
He ascribes them to "spontaneous
variability," and assures us
that "our ignorance of the laws of
variation is profound." We might
adduce a number of other expressions
equally declaratory of his inability
to assign the cause of variation;
but as the Duke of Argyll has taken
such pains to direct attention to this
<i>hiatus</i> in Darwin's evidence, we cannot
refrain from quoting from his <i>The
Reign of Law</i>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It has not, I think, been sufficiently observed
that the theory of Mr. Darwin does
not address itself to the same question, (the
introduction of new forms of life,) and does
not even profess to trace the origin of new
forms to any definite law. His theory
gives an explanation, not of the processes by
which new forms first appear, but only of the
processes by which, when they have appeared,
they acquire a preference over others,
and thus become established in the world. A
new species is, indeed, according to his theory,
as well as with the older theories of development,
simply an unusual birth. The bond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
of connection between allied specific and
generic forms is, in his view, simply the
bond of inheritance. But Mr. Darwin does
not pretend to have discovered any law or
rule according to which new forms have
been born from old forms. He does not
hold that outward conditions, however
changed, are sufficient to account for them.
Still less does he connect them with the effort
or aspirations of any organisms after
new faculties and powers. He frankly confesses
that 'our ignorance of the laws of
variation is profound;' and says that in
speaking of them as due to chance, he
means only 'to acknowledge plainly our ignorance
of the cause of each particular
variation.' Again he says, 'I believe in no
law of necessary development.'" (P. 228.)</p></blockquote>

<p>On page 254, the Duke of Argyll
continues:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It will be seen, then, that the principle
of Natural Selection has no bearing whatever
on the origin of species, but only on the
preservation and distribution of species
when they have arisen. I have already pointed
out that Mr. Darwin does not always
keep this distinction clearly in view; because
he speaks of natural selection 'producing'
organs or 'adapting' them. It cannot be
too often repeated that natural selection
can produce nothing whatever except the
conservation or preservation of some variation
otherwise originated. The <em>true</em> origin
of species does not consist in the adjustments
which help varieties to live and prevail;
but in those previous adjustments
which cause those varieties to be born at
all. Now, what are these? Can they be
traced or even guessed at? Mr. Darwin
has a whole chapter on the laws of variation,
and it is here, if anywhere, that we
look for any suggestion as to the physical
causes which account for the origin as distinguished
from the preservation of the
species. He candidly admits that his doctrine
of natural selection takes cognizance
of variations only after they have arisen,
and that it regards variations as purely accidental
in their origin, or, in other words, as
due to chance. This, of course, he adds,
is a supposition wholly incorrect, and only
serves 'to indicate plainly our ignorance of
the cause of each particular variation.'
Accordingly, the laws of variation which
he proceeds to indicate are merely certain
observed facts in respect to variation, and
do not at all come under the category of
laws, in that higher sense in which the word
law indicates a discovered method under
which natural forces are made to work."</p></blockquote>

<p>It will be seen that we have not
gone too far in proclaiming Darwin's
inability to account for variation. In
the absence, then, of any other rational
explanation, are we not necessitated
to accept the theory of reversion?
What possible objection can
be urged against it? Reversion is
not a heretofore unknown factor.
Nor is it an occult factor. It is constantly
recognized by Darwin. Two
chapters of the <i>Animals and Plants
under Domestication</i> are filled with
phenomena illustrating its action;
and it forms the basis of his lately
propounded hypothesis of pangenesis.</p>

<p>In the interval between the publication
of his <i>Origin of Species</i> and the
writing of his <i>Animals and Plants
under Domestication</i>, Darwin has received
no enlightenment as to the
cause of variation. A writer in <cite>The
North American Review</cite> for October,
1868, holds the contrary, and distinctly
asserts that Darwin is inclined
to adopt the mechanist theory, to attribute
the phenomena of variation
solely to the influence of the physical
conditions, and to repudiate the idea
of a concurrent cause. After speaking
of Mr. Herbert Spencer's ascription
of variations to the physical conditions,
he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In his latest work, Mr. Darwin inclines
to adopt the mechanist theory, so far as the
cause of variations is concerned. 'We will
now consider,' he says, 'the general arguments,
which appear to me to have great
weight, in favor of the view that variations
are directly or indirectly caused by the conditions
of life to which each being, and more
especially its ancestors, have been exposed....
These several considerations alone
render it probable that variation of every
kind is directly or indirectly caused by
changed conditions of life. Or, to put the
case under another point of view; if it were
possible to expose all the individuals of a
species to absolutely uniform conditions,
there would be no variability.' When variations
of all kinds and degrees, that is, all
the gradual differentiations by which the
vast multitude of existing species has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
evolved out of the primordial form or forms,
are thus attributed solely to the accumulative
action of the conditions of life, without
any recognition of a concurrent cause in
that constant self-adaptation by organisms
for which the conditions cannot account, it
would seem fairly inferrible that the mechanist
theory is supposed to explain the
evolution of the species, if not of individual
organisms."</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, there is nothing in the expressions
quoted from Darwin's work,
which justifies such a construction as
<cite>The North American Review</cite> has here
placed upon them. Although we, as
a vitalist, implicitly believe in the coöperation
of other than mechanical
causes, yet we fully and most unqualifiedly
concur in Darwin's assertion
that there would be no variability
were all the individuals of a species
exposed to absolutely uniform conditions.
This fact is by no means incompatible
with a belief in "forces
which manifest themselves in the organism."
We have shown that varieties
or races under nature are attributable
solely to the action of the
conditions of life. Under domestication,
the changed conditions are the
secondary cause of favorable modifications,
reversion being the primary
cause. But without the concurrence
of this secondary cause, it is wholly
impossible for favorable variations to
occur. The expressions of Darwin,
then, carry with them no implication
that variations are solely caused by
the changed condition; for the recognition
of the power of the conditions
to the extent claimed by Darwin
by no means precludes the belief
in a concurrent cause. The
conclusion that a change in the conditions
is a cause of variation, and
that were there no such change there
would be no variability, is necessitated
by the theory here advanced.
For, an acquaintance with phenomena
displaying the action of the physical
conditions forces upon us the
teleological inference that certain
conditions are essential to the full
development of characters. Does it
not thence necessarily follow that,
when the conditions are dissimilar,
modifications will result from the individuals
of a species being exposed
to conditions favorable or unfavorable
in different degrees to the growth
of some of the parts or features?
Darwin's assertion is then quite consistent
with a belief in the concurrence
of causes not mechanical.</p>

<p>But the discovery of Darwin's
opinion on this point is not left solely
to conjecture and speculation.
Had the <cite>North American</cite> Reviewer
carefully perused Darwin's late work,
he would have found many most unequivocal
declarations of the author's
belief in the concurrence of other
causes. They recur most frequently.</p>

<p>On page 248, Vol. II., he says,
"Throughout this chapter and elsewhere,
I have spoken of selection as
the paramount power; yet its action
absolutely depends on what we in
our ignorance call spontaneous or accidental
variability."</p>

<p>Page 250: "Variation depends in
a far higher degree on the nature or
constitution of the being, than on the
nature of the changed conditions."</p>

<p>On page 291, after giving cases of
bud-variation, he says, "When we reflect
on these facts, we become deeply
impressed with the conviction that
in such cases the nature of the variation
depends but little on the conditions
to which the plant has been exposed,
and not in any especial manner
on its individual character, but
much more on the general nature or
constitution, inherited from some remote
progenitor of the whole group
of allied beings to which the plant
belongs. We are thus driven to conclude
that in most cases the conditions
of life play a subordinate part
in causing any particular modification;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
like that which a spark plays
when a mass of combustible matter
bursts into flame&mdash;the nature of the
flame depending on the combustible
matter and not on the spark." And
again, on page 288, "Now is it possible
to conceive external conditions
more closely alike than those to
which the buds on the same tree are
exposed? Yet one bud out of the
many thousands borne by the same
tree has suddenly, without any apparent
cause, produced nectarines.
But the case is even stronger than
this; for the same flower-bud has
yielded a fruit one half or a quarter
a nectarine, and the other half or
three quarters a peach. Again, seven
or eight varieties of the peach have
yielded, by bud variation, nectarines;
the nectarines thus produced no
doubt differed a little from each other;
but still they are nectarines. Of
course there must be some cause internal
or external to excite the peach-bud
to change its nature; but I cannot
imagine a class of facts better
adapted to force on our mind the
conviction that what we call the external
conditions of life are quite insignificant
in relation to any particular
variation, in comparison with the
organization or constitution of the
being which varies."</p>

<p>These assertions that there is something
beyond the actions of the
conditions of life are met with continually
in his work, and they fully
and conclusively show that he is no-wise
inclined to adopt the mechanist
theory. What alternative have we,
then, but to conclude that this occult
potent factor is reversion?</p>

<p>We have, we think, sufficiently
shown that Darwin does not attribute
variations solely to the conditions.
But it has been asserted by the
<cite>North American</cite> Reviewer, of whom
we have often spoken, that Mr. Herbert
Spencer declares them to be thus
solely due. A dozen careful perusals
of <i>The Principles of Biology</i> have failed
to corroborate such a statement.
On the contrary, Mr. Spencer on
many occasions makes use of the
phrase "spontaneous variations,"
though, apparently, under protest.
It is true that throughout his work
there is a constant insistance on the
great part played by the physical
conditions in causing variations.
The greatest prominence is given to
this factor. There is also a manifest
desire that the mechanical forces be
taken as adequate to the production
of the phenomena. But nowhere is
there clearly expressed a repudiation
of the idea of concurrent cause.
In some places there is a recognition
of it.</p>

<p>Thus, on page 281, Mr. Darwin,
after speaking of the action of the
conditions of life, says, "Mr. Herbert
Spencer has recently discussed
with great ability this whole subject
on broad and general grounds. He
argues, for instance, that the internal
and external tissues are differently
acted on by the surrounding conditions,
and they invariably differ in intimate
structure; so, again, the upper
and lower surfaces of true leaves are
differently circumstanced with respect
to light, etc., and apparently in
consequence differ in structure. But,
as Mr. Herbert Spencer admits, it is
most difficult in all such cases to distinguish
between the effects of the
definite action of physical conditions
and the accumulation through natural
selection of inherited variations
which are serviceable to the organism,
and which have arisen independently
of the definite action of these
conditions."</p>

<p>It may be well to remark that the
physical conditions are the sole
cause of variation when viewed in
their statical aspect; but when viewed
in their dynamical aspect, the conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
are, except when the movement
is in the direction of degeneration,
only the secondary cause.
For, upon the theory here enunciated,
were all the individuals of a species
fully developed, there would be
but one race or variety, that is, the
perfect type. The existence of a plurality
of races or varieties necessarily
implies the unfavorable modification
of some of the parts or characters of
some of the members of the species.</p>

<p>It is hardly possible for any one's
common sense to be so impaired,
even by speculation or the bias of a
foregone conclusion, as to induce a
belief that the characters given below
have arisen solely by the action of
the physical conditions. When the
cases are isolated, such a belief is, in
a small measure, excusable; but
when they are given consecutively,
the ascription of the characters solely
to mechanical causes would imply
not a little aberration of mind.</p>

<p>Numerous instances of bud-variation
are given by Darwin. Several
of these we have incidentally adverted
to. By this process of bud-variation
have arisen in one generation
alone, and even in one season, nectarines
from the peach, the red magnum
bonum plum from the yellow
magnum bonum, and the moss-rose
from the Provence rose. Many other
instances might be adduced of the
appearance of characters equally
strongly pronounced.</p>

<p>That the following characters have
not arisen in one generation is confessedly
owing to the lack of scientific
knowledge as to the conditions requisite
for their growth. The English
lop-eared rabbit, which is under domestication,
weighs not less than
eighteen pounds. The pouter-pigeon
is distinguished by the great
size of its &oelig;sophagus; the English
carrier-pigeon, by its surprisingly long
beak; and the fantail, as its name
connotes, by its immense upwardly-expanded
tail. In the progenitor
of these birds, the rock pigeon, (<i>columba
livia</i>,) there is not a trace of
these characters discernible. It is a
matter of great surprise to look at the
stringy roots of the wild carrot and
parsnip, and then to note the astonishingly
great improvement which
has resulted from their subjection to
more favorable conditions. Gooseberries
have attained a great size and
weight. The London gooseberry is
now between seven and eight times
the weight of the wild fruit. The
fruit of one variety of the <i>curcurbita
pepo</i> exceeds in volume that of another
by more than two thousand fold!</p>

<p>Now, these strongly pronounced
favorable modifications are explicable
only upon the theory of reversion.
Had they arisen by the slow accumulation,
through centuries, of successive,
scarcely appreciable increments
of modification, their being
due to evolution, or solely to the
physical conditions, would be less inconceivable.
Darwin's professedly
favorite rule is, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Natura non facit saltum</i>&mdash;"Nature
makes no leaps."
But we fail to see nature's conformity
to it. We must confess that upon
the hypothesis of evolution nature indulges
herself with the most gigantic
leaps.</p>

<p>It might be urged that, upon assuming,
for the purposes of the argument,
that Mr. Herbert Spencer does attribute
variations solely to the physical
conditions, he is thereby discharged
from the imputation of advocating a
theory which is wholly gratuitous.
But he assuredly is not. He is placed
by this ascription of variations in
no better position, so far as respects
this point. He has adduced no evidence
in favor of their being thus
solely ascribable. His attribution of
them solely to the physical conditions
is equally gratuitous with his ascription<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
of them to evolution. The fact
that variations are due to a change
in the conditions, and that variations
would be absent were all the individuals
of a species subjected to absolutely
uniform conditions, is, as we
have seen, quite compatible with a
belief in a concurrent cause. The
necessity of a change in the conditions
is admitted, and even called
for, upon our theory. Mr. Herbert
Spencer's assumed assertion of variation
being due solely to mechanical
causes would necessarily imply
a denial of a concurrent cause. But
this denial is wholly gratuitous; he
has furnished no warrant for it. And
again, assuming him to concede a
concurrent cause, the question then
recurs, Are variations attributable to
reversion or to evolution? As we
have seen, there is no foundation for
ascribing them to evolution&mdash;evolution
being merely a name for a cause
unknown.</p>

<p>In <cite>The Westminster Review</cite> for
July, 1865, and in <cite>The North American
Review</cite> for October, 1868, Mr.
Herbert Spencer is taxed with inconsistency.
In his <i>Principles of
Biology</i>, Mr. Spencer writes, "In
whatever way it is formulated, or by
whatever language it is obscured,
this ascription of organic evolution to
some aptitude naturally possessed, or
miraculously imposed on them, is unphilosophical.
It is one of those explanations
which explains nothing&mdash;a
shaping of ignorance into the semblance
of knowledge. The cause assigned
is not a true cause&mdash;not a
cause assimilable to known causes&mdash;not
a cause that can anywhere be
shown to produce analogous effects.
It is a cause unrepresentable in
thought; one of those illegitimate
symbolic conceptions which cannot
by any mental process be elaborated
into a real conception. In brief, this
assumption of a persistent formative
power, inherent in organisms, and
making them unfold into higher
forms, is an assumption no more tenable
than the assumption of special
creations; of which, indeed, it is but
a modification, differing only by the
fusion of separate unknown processes
into a continuous unknown process."
When he proceeds to treat of the
waste and repair of the tissues, he
finds that they refuse to acknowledge
his mechanical principles, and he is
forced to assume for the living particles
"an <em>innate</em> tendency to arrange
themselves into the shape of the organism
to which they belong." The
inconsistency was noted, commented
upon, and became the subject of
much animadversion.</p>

<p>This inconsistency, however, is
comparatively excusable, as the histological
phenomena which he had
to explain are complicated and involved,
and have to respond to the
influences of divers parts of the
body. But were we to show that
his denunciation of the "ascription
of organic evolution to some aptitude,"
is equally applicable to the attribution
to "evolution," he would
be considered, we are sure, guilty of
the grossest possible inconsistency.
This we can show; for there is no
definition of a "metaphysical entity,"
to which the term evolution does not
answer. Can any one conversant
with the works of the first of evolutionists,
particularly with his <i>First Principles</i>,
<i>Principles of Psychology</i>, and
<i>Principles of Biology</i>, gainsay the
fact that organic evolution implies
a <em>tendency</em> in organisms <em>to advance</em>,
when under the influence of physical
conditions, from the simpler to the
more complex?</p>

<p>Mr. Spencer tacitly assumes the
inevitable "becoming of all living
things;" and that organic progress is
a result of some indwelling tendency
to develop, naturally impressed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
living matter&mdash;some ever-acting constructive
force, which, concurrently
with other forces, moulds organisms
into higher and higher forms. Many
instances of this we might adduce,
but we will quote but two. On page
403, of his <i>First Principles</i>, he speaks
of "a tendency toward the differentiation
of each race into several races."
And on page 430, Vol. I. of
his <i>Principles of Biology</i>, he says,
"While we are not called on to suppose
that there exists in organisms
any primordial impulse which makes
them continually unfold into more
heterogeneous forms, we see that
<i>a liability to be unfolded</i> arises from
the action and reaction between organisms
and their fluctuating environments."</p>

<p>Surely, it cannot, with any show
of reason, be contended that the
word "liability" is not here used as
the perfect synonym of that "metaphysical
entity," the word "tendency."
If the concurrence of a "liability
to be unfolded" and the physical
conditions be the definition of evolution,
were we not warranted in asserting
all that we did, with respect
to the implication of organic evolution?
Evolution a "metaphysical
entity"! The words seem strange.
They sound like a contradiction in
terms; and we know that it is hard
to realize the fact that Mr. Spencer
has based his whole theory upon "some
aptitude." But can the fact be gainsaid?
Do not the thoughts of
every one who reads of a "liability
to be unfolded," recur to the page
where Mr. Spencer stigmatizes such
phrases as unphilosophical? Hear
again how he characterizes them. "In
whatever manner it is formulated, <i>or
by whatever language it is obscured</i>,
this ascription of organic evolution to
some aptitude <i>naturally possessed</i>, or
miraculously imposed on them, is unphilosophical.
It is one of those explanations
which explains nothing&mdash;a
shaping of ignorance into the semblance
of knowledge." Every reader
will, we are sure, concur with us
in the opinion that the evolution hypothesis
is here clearly condemned.
The special creation theory, as here
advocated, involves no occult factor.
The physical conditions concur with
reversion to cause the favorable modifications.</p>

<p>While we do not join in such a
strong protest against the use of what
are termed "metaphysical entities,"
as that in which positivists are wont
to indulge, we cannot but concede
that they have often retarded the
progress of science, and directed the
course of inquiry into wrong channels.
But the true scientist does not
altogether eschew their use; nor does
science preclude his following a middle
course. But that, however,
against which we do most earnestly
and most indignantly protest is their
use for the purpose of showing incongruity
between science and religion;
and their use when there is a perfectly
legitimate alternative. The advocates
of evolution endeavor to laugh
to scorn such phrases; but, double
which way they will, they are forced
to use them, if not in one instance,
at least in another.</p>

<p>We hope, then, never again to hear
"metaphysical entities" urged as an
objection against the special creation
theory. But we incline to retract
that. For the positivists have become,
through practice, so well conversant
with the phraseology peculiar
to this theme, that they are now capable
of masterpieces of wit and
eloquence. Were they, through fear
of the imputation of inconsistency,
to refrain from furnishing the world
with these, we would be debarred
the pleasure of their perusal. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
reluctance would we forego such opportunities
of cultivating a delicacy
of taste.</p>

<p>In <cite>Appleton's Journal</cite> for July 31st,
1869, Mr. Spencer has declared
that "the very conception of spontaneity
is wholly incongruous with
the conception of evolution." Now,
to our mind, the theory of "spontaneous
generation" is the perfect analogue
of the theory of evolution.
We conceive that the latter theory is
open to the same objections which
are urged by Mr. Spencer against the
hypothesis of heterogenesis. "No
form of evolution," he declares, "organic
or inorganic, can be spontaneous,
but in every instance the antecedent
forces must be adequate in their
quantities, kinds, and distributions to
work the observed effects." Now,
do not the alleged cases of evolution,
equally with those of spontaneous
generation, fail to fulfil this requirement?
Does not Mr. Spencer's assumption
of a tendency as a concurrent
cause with the conditions, imply
such a failure? What precludes the
advocates of "spontaneous generation"
from assuming "a liability" in
inorganic matter "to unfold" into
microscopic organisms? Could not
agenesis have resulted from the concurrence
of this tendency with mechanical
causes? Such an explanation
is equally open to the believers
in "spontaneous generation." The
true <i>status</i> of the evolution hypothesis
is really no higher than that of
the hypothesis of heterogenesis.
They are both founded upon similar
bases.</p>

<p>Together with the absurdity of adducing
alleged cases of necrogenesis
as the assumed missing link in the
evolution process, might also have
been mentioned, by Mr. Spencer, an
objection to which the experiments
of Professor Wyman are open. It is
assumed in those experiments that, if
fully matured organisms are not able
to stand a temperature above two
hundred and eight degrees, their ova
would be destroyed when subjected
to a temperature of two hundred and
twelve degrees. These ova are allowed
to stand only a little over three
degrees more than a developed organism.
Is this a fair supposition?
Is it not to be expected that, if a fully
matured organism can stand a temperature
of two hundred and eight
degrees, its ova, which are almost
diatomic in character, will sustain a
temperature approaching that of incandescence?
We trust that this digression
will be pardoned.</p>

<p>Before treating of variation under
domestication, we may take occasion
to disclaim any attempt to account
for variations of color. These are
not so manifestly due to degeneration
and subsequent favorable reversion.
They accord with our theory; but as
this accordance is not susceptible of
the short and complete demonstration
of that of all other variations,
the limits of our series preclude our
entering into a long dissertation on
the subject. Nor would the importance
of modifications of color justify
such a course; for Darwin characterizes
them as phenomena of no
consequence, and assures us that little
attention is paid to them by naturalists.</p>

<p>Under domestication, animals and
plants are subjected to comparatively
favorable conditions, to conditions of
which they have been deprived in
the state of nature. Thus stimulated,
they display marked improvement,
and revert to the perfect condition
from which they have degenerated.
The favorable changes which
they present are noted by man, and
carefully preserved by crossing and
judicious pairing with those possessing
equal advantages. In this way,
the best are selected and made to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
transmit to their offspring their improved
condition. Each breeder's
success is determined by the more or
less favorable conditions of the situation,
district, or country, and by his
sagacity and discrimination in selecting
those in which occurs the greatest
increase of size. As the conditions
vary in different localities, and as
breeders possess different degrees of
scientific knowledge, animals and
plants would be differently improved,
and thus there is established a series
of gradations all answering to the
characters of as many varieties. As
we have seen, in a somewhat similar
manner races have been formed under
nature. They were in part established
by the retention of the animal
or plant in several of the phases
of degeneration; while varieties under
domestication are in part due to
the retention of the organism at each
stage of reversion. The greater
number of varieties under domestication,
as compared with the paucity
of races under nature, results in a
measure from man's selection retaining
the organism at almost every
gradation. Under nature, the animals
of a district or country freely
intercross, and from this intercrossing
results uniformity of character and
the consequent existence of only one
race in a country. Besides, the conditions
of life are comparatively uniform
in each district; but under domestication
man is, by means of his
scientific knowledge, continually varying
the conditions.</p>

<p>We are conscious that this explanation
accounts only for difference of
size. It does not show how wholly
different characters have been acquired
by the various varieties; nor
the cause of the possession of the greatest
structural differences by individuals
of the same species. Were this the
sole process by which varieties were
formed, one variety would be merely
the miniature of the other. Other explanations
are required to illustrate
the manner in which the great divergence
of character observable under
domestication, has been effected.
These we shall furnish.</p>

<p>Darwin, both in his <i>Origin of Species</i>
and in his <i>Animals and Plants
under Domestication</i>, draws particular
attention to this divergence of character.
It forms a most conspicuous
portion of his theory. It displays
the gradual acquisition by individuals
originally alike of differences as great
as those characterizing species.</p>

<p>As Darwin has assured us, there is
scarcely a single species under nature
which does not possess organs in a
rudimentary state. Now, these arise
under domestication, and are apportioned
among the several varieties.
Each organ is developed, and is allotted
to a certain variety, of which it
forms the peculiarity. In one variety,
special attention is paid to the development
of a single organ, while
the remaining organs are left to be
developed in and to form the characteristics
of other varieties. Thus
the upwardly-expanded tail in the
pigeon constitutes the peculiarity characteristic
of the fantail; the enlargement
of the &oelig;sophagus, that of the
pouter; and the divergent feathers
along the front of the neck and
breast, that of the turbit.</p>

<p>By this process&mdash;the development
of rudimentary organs and their apportionment
among the several varieties&mdash;a
portion of the divergence
of character is effected.</p>

<p>These rudimentary organs have been
the occasion of many a warm controversy.
They are asserted to be totally
incongruous with the doctrine
of teleology. Their uselessness and
occasionally detrimental nature, it is
contended, preclude the possibility
of design. Several objections have
been urged against the doctrine of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
final causes; but those who profess
to disbelieve in design concur in according
to these organs the greatest
prominence.</p>

<p>The doctrine of final causes is a
conception thrust upon us by a vast
multitude of facts from organic nature.
But, now and then, exceptional
phenomena will present themselves
apparently at variance with it. These,
as a writer in <cite>The London Quarterly
Review</cite> for July, 1869, ably maintains,
are merely objections, not disproofs.
Owing to a misconception current
among the advocates of special creation,
they have been unable to reconcile
rudimentary organs with the doctrine
of teleology. All the attempts
heretofore made to harmonize these
anomalous features with the doctrine
of final causes have been feeble. We
may instance one. A Mr. Paget, in
his Hunterian Lectures at the College
of Surgeons, argues that the function
of these organs is "to withdraw from
the blood some elements of nutrition,
which, if retained in it, would be positively
injurious." We can readily appreciate
the feelings which induce an
evolutionist to smile at this assumption
of excretion as the sole function
and purpose of a rudimentary organ.</p>

<p>Upon the theory of degeneration
and subsequent favorable reversion
here propounded, these rudimentary
organs are quite congruous
with the doctrine of final cause. To
obviate the difficulty presented by
these parts, we have accepted the
interpretation of the evolutionist.
This interpretation we adopted at the
start. It forms the basis of our
theory&mdash;its foundation-stone. That
for which the evolutionist contends
is, that these organs have at one
period been fully developed. In this
we concurred; for it furnished us
with an explanation of the favorable
modifications under domestication;
while, as we shall show, it is by
no means at variance with the
doctrine of the immutability of the
species. Rudimentary organs imply
degeneration, past complexity of
structure, and present comparative
simplicity of structure; facts at variance
with evolution, but strictly
in accordance with our theory. We
have seen that the idea of the normal
nature of the existing natural condition
has rendered the advocates
of special creation unable to account
for the appearance of profitable modifications.
The seeming incongruity
between rudimentary organs and
the doctrine of teleology is a result of
the same misconception. A curious
confusion of ideas, generated by
the assumption of this false position,
has urged the opponents of evolution
tacitly to contend that animals and
plants were originally created with
these organs in a rudimentary state,
and that the present condition of
these parts is a normal one. We,
concurrently with the evolutionists,
recognize in these organs "traces of
old laws"&mdash;"records of the past."
They are the traces of laws which
obtained when the conditions were
favorable to the full development
of the organs. Under domestication,
the conditions are being supplied,
and the organs are, in consequence,
being developed. On page 386 of
his <i>Principles of Biology</i>, Mr. Herbert
Spencer says, "And then to
complete the proof that these undeveloped
parts are marks of descent
from races in which they were developed,
there are not a few direct
experiences of this relation. 'We
have plenty of cases of rudimentary
organs in our domestic productions&mdash;as
the stump of a tail in tailless
breeds&mdash;the vestige of an ear in ear-less
breeds&mdash;the reappearance of
minute dangling horns in hornless
breeds of cattle.'"</p>

<p>But together with their being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
traces of old laws, they are traces
of laws which so far adhere to the
present that the laws of the whole organism
fail fully to obtain without
their concurrence; and their concurrence
is consequent solely upon the
full development of these rudimental
features. In other words, full perfection
consists in the perfect coördination
of all the parts, and absence
of this coördination suffices to throw
the organism within the domain of
pathology. The reduction, therefore,
of any organ to a rudimentary
condition is deleterious to the organism
as a whole. We are perfectly
aware that this needs something
more than gratuitous affirmation;
but as the adduction of evidence
in this place would be inconsistent
with the symmetry and continuity of
our argument, we are forced to bespeak
our readers' indulgence until
the publication of the next article
of this series. But it is sufficiently
clear that, upon assuming the truth
of our theory, the difficulty offered to
the doctrine of final causes by rudimentary
organs is obviated.</p>

<p>It is manifest that the development
of rudimentary organs, with
their distribution among the several
varieties, is but a partial explanation
of the great divergence of character.
There remain to be shown, then,
other processes by which this has
been effected.</p>

<p>Divergence of character has been
also caused by the development in
different varieties of those parts which
have been only partially suppressed
under nature. This necessarily
causes disproportionate development
of the characters in the individuals.
Proportionate development would
occur if all the features of the animal
or plant were subjected to equally
favorable conditions, and if they were
all impartially cared for by man.
Convergence of character would
thence result. And this convergence
of character is at first sight to be expected.
For if an animal or plant
has, as we have seen, diverged in
character under nature, and then reverts
under domestication to the original
perfect type, that which is to be
anticipated is convergence of character.
But some part presents a modification
in advance of its fellows.
This man seizes and makes it the peculiarity
of a certain variety. By the
careful conservation and judicious
mating of those individuals which
display a tendency to diverge in the
same direction, and of those which
tend least to develop new characters,
he preserves the type of the variety.
Modifications arising in other points
of structure are similarly preserved
by other breeders, and characterize
other varieties. When a variety is
marked by a certain peculiarity, the
fancier or breeder looks with a jealous
eye upon the acquisition by any
individual of any new character, even
though it be for the better. When,
therefore, any individual of a well-established
variety displays a tendency
toward the production of a new character,
it is systematically suppressed.
"Sports" are regarded with disfavor
by the fancier or breeder, and rejected
as blemishes, because they tend
to destroy uniformity of character
among the members of the variety.
Owing to these and similar causes,
in each variety a different point of
structure is admired, selected, and attended
to, and exclusive attention
given to its development, to the neglect
of the others. All the features
are not developed in the same variety,
but are distributed among different
varieties. Thus, in the carrier-pigeon
the length of the beak is the
character particularly attended to;
in the barb, quantity of eye-wattle;
and in the runt, the weight and size
of the body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p>In this way is effected the disproportionate
development upon which
divergence of character is consequent.
Darwin shows this, with this difference:
he believes that the modifications
arise by evolution, while we
contend that they arise by reversion.
Nor does he concur with us in the
use of the term "disproportionate
development;" for that implies that
the presence of all the parts in an
individual is necessary to perfection.
But he shows the process to be the
same, be the law to which the variations
conform what it may. On page
245, Vol. II., he says, "Man propagates
and selects modifications for his
own use and fancy, and not for the
creature's own good." And on page
220 he asserts, "that whatever part
or character is most valued&mdash;whether
the leaves, stems, bulbs, tubers, flowers,
fruit, or seed of plants, or the
size, strength, fleetness, hairy covering,
or intellect of animals&mdash;that
character will most invariably be
found to present the greatest amount
of difference both in kind and degree."</p>

<p>Strong confirmation of this view
that divergence of character is attributable
to disproportionate development
may be drawn from the fact
that those species in which is observable
the greatest divergence of character
are those whose breeding is
directed by fancy or fashion. Where
utility guides selection, there an approximation
to convergence of character
is seen; but where selection is
guided by fancy, there is a very
strongly-marked tendency toward divergence.
In the formation of varieties,
fancy nowhere enters as such a
predominating element as it does in
the breeding of pigeons; and consequently,
nowhere else is seen such
great divergence. Darwin is ever
directing attention to this. On page
220, Vol. I., he dwells upon it with
peculiar emphasis. The converse
fact is also seen. With cattle, the object
of breeders is not the formation
of numerous varieties, but merely the
improvement of the animals. An
objective mode of treatment is here
identical with a subjective mode.
And here we have comparatively proportionate
development, and a consequent
approach to convergence of
character. After citing convergence
of character in the case of pigs, Darwin
says, (Vol. II., page 241,) "We
see some degree of convergence in
the similar outline of the body in
well-bred cattle belonging to distinct
races."</p>

<p>In the foregoing description of the
processes of formation of domesticated
varieties, we have assumed reversion
as the cause of modifications.
We have occasion now to speak of a
process which implies a cause that is
not reversion. Varieties are formed,
and disproportionate development
and divergence of character effected,
by man's continuing the process of
degeneration commenced under nature.
Several illustrations of this we
will adduce.</p>

<p>In the tumbler-pigeon, the beak is
greatly reduced, and, by correlation,
the feet have become of a size so
small as to be barely compatible with
the bird's existence. Its skull is
scarce one half the size of the wild
rock-pigeon, its progenitor; and the
number of the vertebræ has lessened.
The ribs are only seven in number,
whereas the rock-pigeon has eight.
The peculiarity characteristic of this
variety is confessedly due to degeneration.
We refer to the habit of
tumbling which Darwin attributes to
disease&mdash;to "an affection of the
brain." (P. 153.) Other varieties
of the pigeon also owe some of their
characters to degeneration. In the
barb, the beak is .02 of an inch shorter
than in the wild rock-pigeon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
Important characters have correspondingly
deteriorated. Darwin,
speaking of domesticated pigeons,
says, "We may confidently admit
that the length of the sternum, and
frequently the prominence of its crest,
the length of the scapula and furcula
have all been reduced in size in comparison
with the same parts in the
rock-pigeon."</p>

<p>Pigs present several cases of deterioration
of parts under domestication.
Through protection from the climate,
the coat of bristles has been greatly
diminished. By disuse and man's selection,
the legs have become of a
size scarcely compatible with the animal's
power of locomotion. Darwin
requests us to "hear what an excellent
judge of pigs says, 'The legs
should be no longer than just to prevent
the animal's belly from trailing on
the ground. The leg is the least profitable
portion of the hog, and we
therefore require no more of it than is
absolutely necessary for the support of
the rest.'" Fully to realize the extreme
shortness of the legs, it is necessary
to see them in the possession of
a highly improved breed. Correlation
with the legs has led to the complete
reduction of the tusks, and has induced
the shortness and concavity of the
front of the head which are so characteristic
of domestic breeds.</p>

<p>With pigs, there is disproportionate
development and also convergence
of character. This is owing
to all the breeders having aimed at
the same object, the reduction of the
characters given above, and the full
development of the trunk or body.
On page 73, Vol. I., Darwin says,
"Nathusius has remarked, and the
observation is an interesting one, that
the peculiar form of the skull and
body in the most highly cultivated
races is not characteristic of any one
race, but is common to all when improved
up to the same standard.
Thus the large-bodied, long-eared,
English breeds with a convex back,
and the small-bodied, short-eared Chinese
breeds, with a concave back,
when bred to the same state of perfection,
nearly resemble each other
in the form of the head and body.
This result, it appears, is partly due
to similar causes of change acting
on the several races, and partly to
man breeding the pig for one sole
purpose, namely, for the greatest
amount of flesh and fat; so that selection
has always tended toward one
and the same end. With most domestic
animals, the result of selection
has been divergence of character,
here it has been convergence." Divergence
of character is solely caused
by disproportionate development,
and proportionate development in all
the members of the species necessarily
causes convergence of character;
but disproportionate development
may also induce convergence, as it
has done in this case.</p>

<p>Degeneration has also been the
means of the formation of breeds of
cattle, as the niata cattle, and those
distinguished by the complete suppression
of the horns.</p>

<p>Tailless breeds of animals have
been formed; among which may be
mentioned the rumpless fowl, and
tailless cats and dogs.</p>

<p>Ears in other animals have been reduced
to mere vestiges.</p>

<p>Degeneration is also seen in the
great deterioration in size of dogs.
The turn-spit dog is manifestly a case
of degeneration. Blumenbach remarks
"that many dogs, such as the
badger-dog, have a build so marked
and appropriate for particular purposes,
that I should find it difficult to
persuade myself that this astonishing
figure was an accidental consequence
of degeneration." "But," says Darwin,
"had Blumenbach reflected on
the great principle of selection, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
would not have used the term degeneration,
and he would not have
been astonished that dogs and other
animals should have become excellently
adapted for the service of man."
(Vol. II., page 220.) It is difficult to
conceive why Darwin here ignores
the fact of degeneration. The peculiar
build of the badger-dog is not
an accidental consequence of degeneration.
But it is equally far removed
from being the product solely
of selection. Degeneration is not
the less present because of the operation
of selection. Could the two
not act concurrently? It is clearly
manifest that it is the joint action of
degeneration and selection which accomplishes
the appropriateness for
particular purposes, and not either
alone. Selection, in such a case as
this, merely guides the course of degeneration.
Unfavorable modifications
occur, and such of them as best
subserve the uses and purposes of
man, he selects and preserves; the
rest he rejects. Thus results the
adaptation of these animals to the
service of man.</p>

<p>With some fowls, the comb has
been lost. The Sebright bantam,
which is one of the greatest triumphs
of selection, weighs hardly more than
one pound, and has lost its hackles,
sickle-tail feathers, and other secondary
sexual characters.</p>

<p>The Porto Santo rabbit differs in
size from the wild English rabbit, its
progenitor, in the proportion of rather
less than five to nine.</p>

<p>The crooked and shortened legs
of the Ancon sheep of New England,
frequently referred to by Darwin,
also displayed the action of degeneration.
This is a case which
shows that disproportionate development
in a single variety will produce
divergence in the species, even when
there is great proportionate development
in the other varieties.</p>

<p>"With cultivated plants," says Darwin,
"it is far from rare to find the
petals, stamens, and pistils represented
by mere rudiments, like those observed
in natural species." (P. 316.)
The Red Bush Alpine strawberry is
destitute of stolons or runners. In
the St. Valery apple, the stamens and
corolla are reduced to a rudimentary
state. It has, consequently, to be
fertilized by artificial means. This
is effected by the maidens of St. Valery,
each of whom marks her fruit
with a ribbon of a certain color, and
fertilizes it with the pollen of adjacent
trees.</p>

<p>Thus we have four processes of
formation of varieties. 1st. The retention
of the organism at each stage
of reversion, accounting only for differences
of size. 2d. The development
of rudimentary organs and
their apportionment among the several
varieties. 3d. The development
in different varieties of those parts
which have been only partially suppressed
under nature. 4th. The
continuation under domestication of
the process of degeneration commenced
under nature.</p>

<p>Now, we conceive that, by showing
the phenomena of variation to be
conformable to the theory of degeneration
and reversion, and by proving
the unscientific nature of the assumption
of evolution, we have fulfilled
the promise made by us at the start.
Even as the case now stands, the
theory of special creations must commend
itself to every truly scientific
mind. But it is not our design to
leave the subject a mere question of
probabilities. It lies within our power
to prove the doctrine of special
creations to demonstration; to place
our theory upon evidence beyond the
reach of cavil.</p>

<p>To the mind of every reader accustomed
to scientific habits of
thought, it is clear that our next step<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
is to adduce proofs of our belief that
the development of all the parts in
every individual is necessary to perfection.
In this direction we shall
push the subject, and we now affirm
that there is a typical structure&mdash;the
sum of all the positive features of the
species.</p>

<p>With a full appreciation of the
magnitude and importance of the act,
we advance the following definition
of a species.</p>

<p><i>A species is a class of organisms, capable
of indefinitely continued, fertile
reproduction among each other, and endowed
with the possession&mdash;either actual
or potential&mdash;of character; the
suppression, reduction, or disproportionate
development of which is incompatible
with a state of physiological integrity.</i></p>

<h2>A HERO, OR A HEROINE?</h2>


<h3>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
THE LION'S DEN.</h3>

<p>Dr. James invited Margaret to
visit "the shop," and one day, after
returning a few calls in Sealing, she
stopped, with her aunt, on their way
home, at a plain brown house in the
one street of Shellbeach. There were
two square pieces of green, one on
each side of the front door, shut in
with a brown fence; the small door
seemed quite covered up, for, besides
a large shining knocker in the middle,
there was above it a brass plate,
on which was inscribed "Dr. James,"
in large letters. There also appeared
a small bell on one side, and another
opposite labelled "night-bell."
Which of these advantages to improve,
was at first rather a puzzle to
Margaret; but her aunt settled the
question by giving a smart pull to
the right-hand bell, whence she concluded
that the knocker, on which
she had meditated an attack, was
intended solely for unprofitable ornament.</p>

<p>A tall and thin young man, who
had the appearance of having outgrown
all his clothes, opened the
door with a promptness which seemed
to imply that he had been lying
in wait for the favorable moment to
pounce upon them, and which was a
little startling to the ladies. He surveyed
them both with interest, explained
that the doctor was not at
home, but was expected in, and proposed
that they should walk into the
parlor and wait. Having ushered
them into that apartment, the youth
discreetly withdrew.</p>

<p>"My dear aunt, what a forlorn
room! And do you see the dust?"</p>

<p>Miss Spelman shook her head in a
mournful manner, and proceeded to
establish herself on a black horsehair
couch, (having first gently flapped it
with her handkerchief,) while Margaret
walked about from one thing
to another, commenting and criticising.</p>

<p>"This is where he sits to write, I
suppose. And if here isn't a family of
three little kittens curled up in his
arm-chair! I hope he won't mistake
them for a cushion, that's all! What
piles of books! Medicine, medicine,
medicine! Oh! here is something
of a different kind; poetry! who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
would have imagined it? Shelley,
Longfellow, Tennyson. How many
nice things! This bookcase is filled
with treasures. The dust can't get
in there, that's a comfort! And this
is a family portrait, I suppose; a lady
with one, two, three, six children.
How funny and old-fashioned it is!
Here are his pipe and smoking-cap;
oh! do see these funny skin slippers;"
and she balanced one on each hand.
"How I would like to rummage
here! Oh! there are sleigh-bells."
And Margaret established herself,
prim and proper, in one of the hard,
straight-backed chairs just as Dr.
James entered. He gave them a
pleasant welcome, and conducted
them at once into "the shop."</p>

<p>"It's a good time to look about
here," he observed, "while John is
gone with the mare. The shop is his
especial sanctum, and I think he regards
visitors as interlopers."</p>

<p>There was no dust to be seen in
that room; every thing was scrubbed
and brushed till it shone, and absolute
neatness reigned.</p>

<p>"This does not look to me like a
shop," said Margaret.</p>

<p>"I can't say I deal in 'slippery-ellum,'
'stick-licorish,' and 'gum-arrabac-drops,'"
replied the doctor;
"if you want the real name, this is a
dispensary on a small scale. You
see, I have no faith in Mr. Creamer,
in Sealing, further than for simple
doses. You might buy essence of
peppermint or tincture of rhubarb of
him, to great advantage; but as for
compounding pills and powders, I
prefer to attend to those myself.
Then it is a convenience to some
of my patients, who can make a
visit to the doctor and obtain their
remedies at one and the same time."</p>

<p>At these words, Miss Spelman gave
her niece a little nudge, as they stood
side by side, and looked, as the saying
is, volumes; but Margaret did
not understand, and wondered what
her aunt could mean.</p>

<p>"And who is John?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh! John is my factotum; as
much a part of myself as the shop
is. You see he stays here when I
am away, and goes on errands; he
keeps every thing nice, and can be
trusted with simple prescriptions; in
return for which, I impart to him a
little medical knowledge; so we stand
both amicably in each other's debt,
which leads to an excellent understanding
between us."</p>

<p>Again Margaret felt herself gently
poked; but being as completely in the
dark as ever, she was forced to wait
for an explanation till a future time.
They admired all the arrangements, till
John's return, when the doctor led them
back into the parlor, where, the fire
having been stirred up and the curtains
drawn so as to admit the sun,
the aspect of things was more cheerful.
Margaret once more admired
the kittens and books, and accepted
the doctor's offer to lend from the
latter, by borrowing Miss Procter's
poems, in blue and gold, which she
espied on a high shelf.</p>

<p>On their drive homeward, Margaret
said,</p>

<p>"Why did you punch me, Aunt
Selina? Was I misbehaving?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed! I only wanted you
to notice what the doctor was saying.
What was it?"</p>

<p>"The first time was when he said
his patients could visit him and get
their remedies at the same time."</p>

<p>"Yes, just his benevolence. Those
are his poor patients, you see, for
whom he has set up that dispensary; he
gives them advice and medicine free."</p>

<p>"But then he must have money."</p>

<p>"So he has, a little; but he uses up
every cent and more; for he sends
some to his mother and sister, and
takes ever so much care of the poor
for miles around."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>"But he must have fees from his
rich patients; you told me he was as
popular at Sealing as here."</p>

<p>"Certainly they pay him; but he
does not encourage a large practice
in Sealing, for there is a very good
doctor living there, with a wife and
family. So though Dr. James visits
a few patients in Sealing, they are
almost all people who used to live
here, and are now not willing to give
him up. But his fees could not begin
to enable him to do all he does,
if he had not something of his own."</p>

<p>"The second time you admonished
me was when he spoke of his
boy."</p>

<p>Miss Spelman laughed contemptuously.</p>

<p>"It was exactly like him to speak
as if that matter was a give-and-take
affair! The fact is, the boy's mother,
a widow, took it into her head, like
all mothers, that her son was something
remarkable, and ought to be
sent to college; of course without a
penny to do it with. She disclosed
her mind to Dr. James, and the end
of it was, that he has taken him clean
off her hands, gives him a nice little
salary for the work he does in the
dispensary, and is educating him,
besides, to be a first-rate physician;
and I suppose when the doctor goes
away from this town, young Richards
will just step into his place and have
it all his own way. I know all this,
you see, because I know the mother.
The doctor never breathed a word of
it, you may be sure; but she told me
all about it. And this is what Dr.
James calls a mutual-benefit society,
or something of the sort."</p>

<p>Margaret laughed; but she was
not disposed to praise or admire the
doctor, chiefly because she was aware
that her aunt expected and wished
her to do so. She listened attentively,
however, to this, and as much
more information as Miss Spelman
chose to volunteer about her favorite,
now and then putting in a
doubtful question, or slightly depreciatory
remark, which only elicited
fresh praises; until sometimes the
little lady would dimly perceive the
game her niece was playing, and retire
into silence and dignity.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER IX.<br />

STUDY OF HUMAN NATURE.</h3>

<p>A month had gone, Margaret was
astonished to find how quickly. She
was contented and happy; interested,
too, in her various occupations, and,
except for missing Jessie's sympathy
and companionship, feeling no regret
for her former life. Such a state of
things would have been impossible,
had she not been utterly wearied
with the whirl of gayety and the accumulation
of engagements which
seemed to her unavoidable while she
remained in New York. But the
complete change was reviving to her,
and, as she said, she had taken up
the study of human nature, which
really meant that she had become interested
in one person, and that person
was Dr. James. She saw him a
good deal; for he came freely to Miss
Spelman's house, he had taken her
sleigh-riding, accompanied her on expeditions
in search of coasting or skating,
played chess with her, and lent
her books.</p>

<p>Since that occasion, on their first
drive to Sealing, when "the mistress
of a poor man's household" had
been alluded to, that ideal person
was frequently spoken of with considerable
enjoyment of the joke by
both parties, and once Margaret had
asked him outright, what he would
consider necessary accomplishments
in such a person.</p>

<p>"I don't know that a poor doctor's
wife would differ from the wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
of any other poor man," he had answered
her. "I have in my mind a
woman not afraid of work, not requiring
amusement nor excitement,
able to do her own work; you see I
say <em>able</em>&mdash;not that I would object to
her having a servant, or perhaps two;
but she should understand and be
able to explain and direct all the domestic
arrangements of the house.
She should wait on herself; therefore
her dress should be plain and simple.
Especially should she know how to
cook and sew, to market well, and to
be considerate and cheerful to her servants.
Then, as concerns my professional
business, I should think a slight
acquaintance with simple medicines
and remedies, and where they are
kept in the shop, in case of emergency,
would be useful; fortitude to bear
the sight of, and even to suffer, pain
and sickness, so as to set a good example;
and, to sum up, a cool head,
a steady hand, and presence of
mind."</p>

<p>When Dr. James had ended this
minute description, he was struck by
the extent of his requirements; and
as Margaret's eye met his, they both
laughed heartily, and though at the
time she made no comment on his
ideal poor man's wife, she often alluded
to her virtues afterward, before
other people, who, of course, could
not understand what she meant,
while the doctor, she was delighted
to see, was slightly embarrassed and
at a loss for a reply.</p>

<p>Margaret had seen a little of the
Sealing society at a few tea-parties,
which aimed at being so genteel that
they were insufferably stiff and drowsy.
Margaret longed to do something
to wake up the young men,
who, dressed in their best, with the
stiffest of collars and the most surprising
cravats, sat with folded hands and
feet placed close together, helplessly,
just where they happened to be put,
without daring to do more than assent
in as few words as possible to
the stream of conversation kept up
by the ladies, who seemed to consider
it the business of the evening to
entertain them. She very nearly
proposed "blind-man's buff" on one
occasion, but her courage failed her
at the last moment; she thought it
would be a hopeless undertaking to
attempt to infuse life and activity into
such frozen figures. At last, one
young woman, named Mary Searle,
gave a small party, and had the independence
to propose playing games;
and when Margaret warmly seconded
the movement, and set the example
by suggesting "fox and geese,"
she was astonished to behold every
body become at once natural and
merry. The young men were metamorphosed,
forgot their feet and
hands, and performed wonders of
agility. It dawned upon Margaret
that all this restraint must have been
occasioned wholly by her presence,
and she did her best to dispel all
respect for "city ways" by showing
that she could romp with the merriest.
The evening ended with a
Virginia-reel, and from that time the
ice was broken, and Margaret saw
the people in their pleasantest light&mdash;without
affectation, simple, kindly,
and cheerful. But of "society"
she saw little; the Sealing young ladies
complained that she was not
"sociable," though when they were
with her they got on very well; she
said she was "too busy" to visit
much, and so managed to keep a
good deal to herself.</p>

<p>Of Martha Burney, however, she
saw a good deal, and before long
made an arrangement to drive her
every morning to her school. The
Marchioness had come, and Margaret
had hired a little sleigh for her
own use and pleasure.</p>

<p>"You see I have to get up early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
now, for my drive with Miss Burney,"
she explained to the doctor; for she
was anxious that he should not think
she was trying to please him. After
leaving her companion, who returned
in the afternoon by the cars, she
sometimes stopped for her organ lesson,
and sometimes came directly
home, where she practised, or shut
herself up to study Latin. This latter,
however, was a secret. The day
she visited Dr. James's dispensary,
she had noticed Latin names on his
jars and vials, and had then and
there decided in her own mind that
some acquaintance with Latin would
be indispensable to "a poor doctor's
wife." So she had bought a dictionary,
grammar, and one or two Latin
books, and now worked laboriously
in private, every day, while in the afternoons
she walked, drove, or read
with her aunt.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER X.<br />

AN AWAKENING.</h3>

<p>One Sunday evening, Dr. James
was sitting in Miss Spelman's pleasant
parlor; she was dozing in her
chair by the fire, and Margaret sat on
a little sofa near her. There had
come a long pause, such as very often
came on Sunday evenings, and
on this occasion the doctor had been
more abstracted and inattentive than
usual. He sat by the table in an
arm-chair, studying the fire with a
troubled face, and Margaret watched
him and wondered what was wrong.
At last he started and said, as their
eyes met,</p>

<p>"Miss Lester, pardon me. I believe
I am very rude; I have a good
deal on my mind, and when you
stop speaking, my thoughts go off
to something I cannot forget."</p>

<p>He paused a moment, and then,
before she could answer him, went on.
"They talk about a doctor's becoming
callous, and indifferent to pain
and suffering; I wish it were more
true! Of course there are certain
things which, when we have seen
them borne well and bravely by
some, we expect others to meet in
the same way, and so seem unfeeling
and unsympathizing when folks make
a great fuss about them.</p>

<p>"When, however, I see people really
suffering and in want, it makes me
sick at heart, and I cannot forget it.
There is a family a couple of miles
out of the east end of this town who
are in great trouble, and I don't see
what can help them out of it." He
stopped abruptly and stared at the
fire again.</p>

<p>"Dr. James, do you suppose I
am not interested? Go on quickly,
and tell me the rest; for perhaps I
can help these poor people."</p>

<p>He looked at her earnestly and
continued,</p>

<p>"The husband is a shoemaker; a
good fellow, though thriftless. It is
the old story; want of work, a sick
wife, a large family, rent due, and the
wolf at the door. I have been to
several people; but money seems very
scarce just now, and more is needed
than I can raise for them. My own
funds are very low, and some kind
people suggest the poor-house at
Sealing for them; but that would
break their spirit; so I can't bear to
think of it."</p>

<p>"Why, Dr. James! of course I
can help them. Why did you not
come to me before? Cannot we go
to-night and pay the rent, and take
them what they need?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow will do for them; if
you like, however, I can take the
rent to Mr. Brown to-night. Perhaps
you will sleep better for it; I know I
shall. To-morrow you can drive
there, and do what you think best
for them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>Margaret's sympathy seemed very
consoling to the doctor, and he talked
to her freely of the state of the
poor people with whom he came in
contact. He said he had to see so
much misery he could not possibly relieve,
that it was a constant weight
on his mind; it haunted him like a
ghost; and even when warm and
comfortable himself, he could not forget
those wants which he so desired
to relieve but could not. Then the
people in the neighborhood rendered
him but little assistance; for they
either did not realize, or else were indifferent
to the destitution of their
neighbors.</p>

<p>Dr. James had never before opened
his mind to Margaret as he did
that evening. He spoke of his intense
sympathy with the poor, simply
and as a matter of course; and every
word conveyed to her a reproach,
for it made her conscious of her own
selfishness and hardness of heart.
Though she had always given freely,
when asked, to fairs and subscriptions,
and to charity collectors, she
had done so, as she now saw, out
of her abundance, and with a cold
heart. How much thought had she
ever given to the sufferings of the
poor? What had she ever done to
relieve them? Yet here was a man
whose whole life was devoted to helping
and healing his fellow-creatures,
and who reproached himself for enjoying
the simplest comforts so long
as others were without them. A
whole mine of new thoughts seemed
opened in her mind; she longed to
be alone; and when Dr. James had
left her, after warmly grasping the
hand that had given him the rent for
his poor family, she said good-night
to her aunt as early as possible, and
going to her own room, she thought
long and regretfully of the past, and
formed a firm resolution to live more
nobly for the future.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XI.<br />

UNEXPECTED ADVICE.</h3>

<p>The next morning, after driving
Martha Burney to Sealing as usual,
Margaret filled her sleigh with good
things at the grocery and provision
stores and then made her way, by
the directions Dr. James had given
her, to the house of John McNally,
the poor man of whom he had spoken.
She found the distress quite as
great as she had expected, and would
not have known what to do first, had
she not found there a woman from
the neighborhood who was endeavoring
to assist the sick wife. This
woman at once made gruel and tea,
and put away the provisions in their
proper places, while Margaret collected
around her the children, who
were half starving, and distributed
among them a plentiful supply of
bread and butter, to which she afterward
added a dessert of oranges and
candy.</p>

<p>Poor John looked on as though it
were all a dream, and watched Margaret's
every movement as he would
those of a good fairy, till, she turning
to him, said kindly,</p>

<p>"Will you not sit down and have
some breakfast? Perhaps this friend
of yours will cook some steak for
you."</p>

<p>Then he mechanically sat down on
a chair near the table, and covering
his face with his hands, strove to
hide tears of joy that trickled down
his cheeks. Margaret went into the
chamber and sat by the wife, who was
sitting up in bed drinking her gruel,
while Susan, the friend, went to cook
the steak, the savory smell of which
soon filled the little house. Margaret
left them with a promise to return
the next day; but before she went,
she put into John's hand a twenty-dollar
bill, bidding him get every
thing that his wife and family needed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>What a happy day that was for
Margaret! She felt so light-hearted
and joyous that she could hardly attend
to her usual duties; but she endeavored
to study and practise the
regular number of hours, saying to
herself, "If I am going to do good
every day, I must not let it interfere
with every thing else." In the afternoon
she would not go out; she was
sure the doctor would come, and she
could not afford to miss his call. So
Miss Selina took one of her friends
to drive, and Margaret sat at home
waiting. Tea-time came and her
aunt returned, and still the visitor
she expected had not appeared; at
length, as they left the table, sleigh-bells
were heard, and the doctor
opened the hall door.</p>

<p>"There is a lovely moon, Miss
Lester; can you not wrap yourself
up and take a short drive with me?"</p>

<p>She hastened to get her hood,
muff, and shawl, and in a few moments
was flying over the frozen
ground, in and out of the white
moonlight and the dark shadows, the
sleigh-bells ringing gayly, and her
own heart beating fast with joy.</p>

<p>Dr. James was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"You can't think what a pleasure
it has been to me all day, to think of
those poor people relieved from their
trouble and wretchedness; I am sure
it has been a happiness to you also.
The poor things consider your help
as a direct interposition of providence,
and I must say they seem full
of gratitude rather to God than to
you. They appear to consider you
as merely a secondary cause of their
relief."</p>

<p>"That is right enough, Dr. James;
I owe a great deal more to them
than they to me; I was never so happy
before in my life."</p>

<p>"I can well believe it. But I must
tell you something, Miss Lester, that
may diminish your satisfaction a little;
which I would not mention, however,
if I did not think it would be useful
in the future. What you did for the
family was, in the main, excellent;
but you remember I told you McNally
was thriftless! Well, the sum
of money you put into his hands
was too large; when he went to
Sealing for medicine and things for
his wife, some idle fellows got hold
of him, and the consequence was,
I found him reeling about the street
this afternoon, with a small bottle of
medicine in his pocket, and all his
money gone. I took him home, and
administered the medicine to his wife
myself; it was useless to speak to
him then, but to-morrow I am going
there to talk to him as he deserves,
for he has not been drunk before for
months."</p>

<p>"Why, I have done more harm
than good."</p>

<p>"Not so bad as that, I am sure;
you were injudicious, and a great deal
too lavish in your bounty."</p>

<p>"Dr. James, it seemed to me very
little to leave, when so much was
needed; I quite congratulated myself
on my prudence."</p>

<p>"It was a great deal of money for
a poor man to have in his pocket.
In almost all such cases the wife is
the one to intrust with the money;
she knows for what it is most needed,
and makes it go as far as it can; but
the best way of all, I think, is to find
out, by interesting yourself, what are
the wants of the poor, and supply
them by your personal care. When
you have time, you might go and
talk with Rose&mdash;that is the wife&mdash;and,
if you like, give her what she
needs."</p>

<p>"I am glad you told me this, Dr.
James; it will teach me to be wiser
next time. You see I am wholly inexperienced,
for I never did any thing
of the kind before in my life. Now I
am determined to try again. Can't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
you tell me of another case of distress
among your patients?"</p>

<p>"Not at present, I believe, though,
for that matter, I believe there is no
want of poor people at any time.
Miss Lester, excuse my asking you;
do you want to do good systematically,
and practically, and perseveringly,
or is this only a passing enthusiasm,
which will vanish when the
novelty ceases?"</p>

<p>"Dr. James, if I do good perseveringly,
as you say, I suppose the
excitement will wear off, and it will
become a very matter-of-fact, unromantic
business, perhaps even tedious
and inconvenient; still, I have thought
about it all to-day, and I have made
up my mind to help as many people
as I can. So long as I remain here,
it shall be one of my occupations."</p>

<p>"Very well, then; and for the direction
of practical, systematic good
works, I advise you to go to the
Catholic priest."</p>

<p>"What! to that fat man with the
red face, who laughs so loud?"</p>

<p>"Ah Miss Lester! if you had a
little more medical knowledge, you
would be aware that natural temperament
is in itself enough to account
for the corpulence of some people, to
say nothing of the sedentary life a
priest generally leads; and in finding
fault with that laugh, you touch on
a tender point; for it is, in my eyes,
one of Father Barry's shining virtues.
It is the 'being jolly' under
all circumstances, and in spite of
every thing adverse and difficult,
which makes this obscure country
priest a great man. Think of his life!
What can be more laborious, more
self-sacrificing, more ill-paid, thankless
and disheartening? And look at his
face! My dear Miss Lester, he is an
educated man, and yet his intercourse
is entirely with the rude and ignorant
poor of this most bigoted of places.
He is cut off from all those who profess
to be people of education here,
and who look down on him with contempt
and suspicion, because they
cannot even conceive what a life of
devotion and self-sacrifice means.
What could have induced him to
choose such a life, liable to be condemned
to such a place and such a
people, I do not understand."</p>

<p>"Think of your own life, Dr.
James."</p>

<p>"Ay, there it is; I often think of
the two lives, and naturally compare
them. Now, see the difference: I
choose this place for myself, and shall
stay here as long or as short a time
as I see fit; he, as I understand it, is
placed here by his bishop, for a year
or for his lifetime, he knows not
which. Then, I work among these
people because it makes me contented,
and because I cannot bear to see
misery and not relieve it. But he,
strange to say, is not moved by a
spirit of active benevolence only, or
even chiefly, so far as I can judge;
for he believes human suffering to be
the penalty of sin; a penalty which
must be paid&mdash;therefore, better paid
in this life than in the life to come;
and when I say to him, 'Then why
do you do good to every one within
your reach?' he answers, 'For the
love of God.'"</p>

<p>"Strange!" Margaret answered,
feeling that he expected her to say
something, but with her mind occupied,
it must be confessed, rather with
her companion's character than with
that of the priest.</p>

<p>"Yes, you see he is as far removed
from mere philanthropy as he can
be, and yet I know of no life so useful
as his; mine grows dim beside it.
Then, again, when I compare our
lives, he has none of that self-approval,
or rather self-complacency,
which is the staff and support of
mine."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just what I say. Of course I
know that my work is a good and
useful one, and that I do it well. I
know, moreover, that there are not
many men of my age and abilities
who would consent to live such a life
as mine. Hence I feel at times a
self-satisfaction which is to me inspiration,
and strength, and refreshment.
On the contrary, Father Barry, though
his life appears to me crowded with
good works, seems to fear that if he
should die now his hands would be
found empty. His life differs from
mine in its motive: he acts from religious
principle, while I help the poor
only because it makes me wretched
to see suffering without trying to
relieve it. You see I talk to him
freely; I meet him a good deal
among my patients, and we have
done some good turns for each other.
I go to see him, and when he is not
busy, often sit with him of an evening;
and he is the best company
I know. But I have been so engrossed
by my own reflections that I
forgot I was giving you advice; by
all means if you want to bestow relief
where it is most needed, ask his
assistance.</p>

<p>"Why not the minister here, or at
Sealing?"</p>

<p>"Dr. Thorndike here is, as you
know, an old man, too old and infirm
to visit much; he could not help you;
and Mr. Sparks, at Sealing, has a
large family, a wife who is always
delicate, and a small salary. Poor
fellow! he means to do his duty; but
his only servant is a little girl, and
after a wakeful night, walking up and
down with the baby, he has to see to
the furnace fire, split the wood, and
do 'chores' generally. Then he has
his sermons to write, his parishioners
to visit, and little tea-drinkings to
grace with his presence; of all of
which duties I admit he acquits himself
irreproachably. He is, in fact,
quite a model parson, and so, I assure
you, he is considered at Sealing; but,
as you may imagine, he has little time
for miscellaneous visiting among the
poor. Indeed, he is only too glad to
have Father Barry assume almost the
whole of that hard work, and is on
the best of terms with him in private,
though he rails against popery and
the priesthood from the pulpit in the
most popular manner. No; I don't
advise you to be guided either by
our Congregationalist brother here,
or our Methodist brother at Sealing.
Father Barry knows every poor family
for twenty miles around, and he can
give you as much and more work than
you can attend to." By this time
they were nearing home and the
doctor said,</p>

<p>"I am glad you are not discouraged
by this little accident, at the
outset of your benevolent works; it
is brave of you, and deserves better
success next time. You have done
well for the beginning, and have reason
to feel happy. I will go over to
McNally's to-morrow, and frighten
him a little, and in the afternoon, or
the next day, you can go to see his
wife again."</p>

<p>Dr. James declined to come in; he
shook hands warmly with Margaret,
and drove away. Miss Spelman was
very curious to know what had taken
place on the drive.</p>

<p>"Was he agreeable, my dear? Did
he tell you about himself?"</p>

<p>"Rather about his friend the priest;
how strange that he should think so
much of him."</p>

<p>Miss Spelman shook her head, "I
don't approve of that intercourse;
these priests are very sly, and who
knows that he may not be a Jesuit in
disguise? I have warned the doctor
about it, but he is very self-willed.
Would you believe it, my dear? The
only place he ever goes on Sundays
is to the Catholic mass, either at Sealing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
or here, where they have it in the
hall once a month; on which occasion
Father Barry always dines with him.
I do not mean to say that Dr. James
goes to the mass every Sunday, for he
often sleeps late on that day; but he
never goes to church anywhere else."</p>

<p>"I don't blame him," said Margaret,
"for not enjoying Dr. Thorndike's
sermons; they always put me to sleep;
or Mr. Sparks's either, for that matter,
they are so intensely commonplace!
I am sure I could write a great deal
better ones, without having been to
college or studied divinity, either."</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XII.<br />

PROGRESS.</h3>

<p>Margaret did not see the doctor
till the next evening; she had been
very busy all day, and so had he; but
as she was playing cribbage with
Miss Spelman, after tea, he made his
appearance, and, declaring that he had
plenty of time, and that they must
finish their game, he sat down before
the fire and waited till Miss Spelman
triumphantly announced:</p>

<p>"A double sequence, eight; pairs
royal, fourteen; that takes me out,
my dear."</p>

<p>"It is a rubber, too," Margaret observed,
rising and approaching the
fire. "Now, Doctor James, I have some
business to talk over with you, and
you must come with me into the dining-room;
or I will put on my cloak,
and we will go out on the piazza."</p>

<p>"It is moonlight out there," remarked
Miss Spelman, "if you only
dress warm enough."</p>

<p>"And will the moon retire behind
a cloud, if I should insist on catching
cold, aunty? But you need not be
afraid; my cloak is very warm; I will
put the hood over my head, and we
will walk fast up and down all the
time. Shall we not, Doctor James?"</p>

<p>They proceeded to the piazza, and
began their promenade, while Miss
Spelman, taking occasion to go into
the dining-room, stood there in the
dark, smiling as she watched their
figures pass back and forth before the
window. "It is all going just right,"
she thought; "how much they always
have to say to each other!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as soon as they had
stepped out of the window, Margaret
began, "Well, Doctor James, where
do you suppose I have been to-day?"</p>

<p>"To the McNallys', this afternoon,
I suppose."</p>

<p>"Very wisely guessed; but where
have I been this morning?"</p>

<p>"Really, Miss Lester, you tax my
curiosity too far; I am not good at
guessing."</p>

<p>"I have been to see Father Barry."</p>

<p>"Really!" he exclaimed, now surprised
indeed, for he had not imagined
she would act so promptly on
their talk of the previous evening.
He did not yet understand the energy
of her character, her activity and
earnestness, which made a resolve
and its fulfilment almost simultaneous.</p>

<p>"Why are you surprised? Listen,
and I will tell you all about it. I had
such a remarkable adventure! You
see Miss Burney and I drove to Sealing
this morning, as usual. I did not
tell her a word of what I was going
to do; I only worked on her sensibilities
a little about the McNallys;
not that I wanted her to do any thing
for them, but merely because I felt like
harrowing somebody's feelings. After
I had left her, I took my lesson,
shopped a little, paid a visit to those
silly Gleeson girls&mdash;putting off the
evil day, you see&mdash;and then went
straight to Father Barry's house. As
I approached, I saw a woman coming
out of the gate, holding in her hand
two plates&mdash;one turned upside down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
&mdash;evidently containing something
good. She was talking to herself and
saying, 'O God bless him! God
bless him!' and did not seem to see
me or any thing else. My curiosity
was roused, and I stopped her by asking,
'God bless whom? And what
have you got in those plates?' She
stared at me for a moment, and then
exclaimed, 'Oh! but he is a darling
man!' 'God bless and reward him!'
and so on. At last I extorted from
her that his reverence had given her
'a bit of lovely steak,' for her sick
daughter at home. I was interested,
and hurried past her, up the steps, where
I found the door ajar, left so probably
by the woman, in coming out. I was
a little curious, I acknowledge, and
hence did not stop to ring. After
entering, I paused to consider what I
should do next. There were two
closed doors on one side of the entry,
and one half open, on the other.
I approached the one that was partly
open, and stood on the threshold of&mdash;what
do you suppose? actually the
dining-room, with Father Barry seated
at the table, eating bread and butter,
with a dish of potatoes on the
table, and before him a saucer containing
two boiled eggs. I understood
how things were, at a glance;
he had sent his own dinner away with
that woman, and was dining on eggs
instead. Why are you laughing?"
Margaret exclaimed, suddenly breaking
off.</p>

<p>"The whole thing is so amusing,
and I would say so characteristic.
Your stopping the woman, entering
the house as if it belonged to you,
seeing all that poor Father Barry was
eating for his dinner, and then making
so complete a story out of the whole
affair. Forgive me for laughing; you
can't think how interested I am. Will
you not go on?"</p>

<p>Margaret, who had been perfectly
serious herself, after a moment's pause
continued, "I was taken aback, you
may be sure, and begged pardon in
a very confused manner; but Father
Barry rose, and, with the utmost politeness,
asked me if there was any thing
he could offer me. I thought to
myself that there was not much left
to offer any one. So I asked permission
to wait till he had finished,
and he showed me into a sort of parlor,
where something, which must
have been a confessional, made part
of the furniture; and there I sat
and stared at large maps of the county
and of Ireland, and pictures of
a pope and of the Virgin, for about
ten minutes, when he came and
asked me to excuse him for keeping
me waiting. He knew me before
I told him my name, and seemed
surprised when I explained what I
had come for. He said he wished he
could give me Sunday-school work
to do, but as I was not a Catholic,
that was impossible. However,
there was quite enough of other
work to be done. He was very kind,
and we soon came to a good understanding.
The first family he spoke
of were the McNallys, and he proposed&mdash;only
think how sensible!&mdash;that
I should give John some work
to do. He said shoes were very
much needed among his Sunday-school
children, this winter; so he
proposed that I should order a number
of pairs of different sizes, and
bring them by instalments, for him to
distribute among his children. Altogether,
I was very glad I went, and I
see that his advice will be most useful.
I am going again on Friday."</p>

<p>"I am sure you have been quite
successful. Still, don't undertake
more than you can perform."</p>

<p>"No. Father Barry said the same;
I will take care not to overdo things
in the beginning, because I mean to
keep it up."</p>

<p>"I found John McNally," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
the doctor, "quite overcome by
shame and remorse; he was sure the
lady would never trust him again. I
told him he did not deserve that she
should. I was very harsh at first,
and only allowed myself to be softened
by degrees. At last I told him
that his rent was paid, and that I
would try to get him work."</p>

<p>"And I found Rose sitting up, this
afternoon," said Margaret. "She
would like to do a little plain sewing
when she is better, and I said I
would get her some. She says they
could get along very well, if John
could only have steady work to do;
but it is so much easier to buy shoes
in Sealing, that people forget him.
Now, Dr. James, I have a plan of
moving them to Sealing, and getting
a little shoe-shop for John, and then
they would be sure to prosper, for he
is a good workman, I hear."</p>

<p>"Let me caution you against beginning
too impulsively in favor of
this one family. Remember that
there are others in want, and you
cannot do so much for all. Besides,
I have known a sudden stroke of
good luck to prove the ruin of poor
and honest people like these. I
think we can get John more work,
and I will take care that other people
do not forget him."</p>

<p>Margaret was reluctantly persuaded
to give up the plan of a removal
to Sealing, and only comforted herself
by ordering of McNally fifty
pairs of shoes for Father Barry's Sunday-school
children.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

A PROOF OF FRIENDSHIP.</h3>

<p>There is no need of describing
more fully the three winter months
that Margaret passed at Shellbeach.
The time went faster than ever, after
she had offered her services to Father
Barry. Under his direction, she did
great good; more indeed than any
one knew of, for she had obtained a
promise from the good priest that he
would not speak of her charities.
So when Dr. James once or twice
tried to lead his friend to speak about
the matter, Father Barry, desirous
that she should not lose the reward
of the "Father who seeth in secret,"
only smiled and said, "She knows
all about it, you must go to her." As
for the McNallys, Margaret still considered
them as her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégés</i>, and
cherished in private the project for
improving their condition.</p>

<p>Then she had done something else,
a thing of which she was very proud,
and of which she often afterward
boasted&mdash;she had taught a roomful
of children in the public school at
Sealing! Old Mr. Burney was growing
more and more infirm, and seemed
threatened with the entire loss
of his mind. It became every day
more difficult to leave him; and one
morning, Margaret, on calling as
usual for her friend, found that her father
had had a shock of paralysis, and
could not be left. Martha had planned
to send an excuse by Margaret
for her absence; but she could think of
no person to supply her place, and
she was completely surprised by Margaret's
announcing her intention to
try her hand at managing the children!
All remonstrance was in vain,
and having received a few brief directions,
Margaret drove rapidly away
to Sealing. How her fashionable
friends in New York would have
opened their eyes, had they been favored
with a sight of Miss Lester
hearing two or three dozen children
recite the multiplication-table!</p>

<p>She returned in the afternoon, radiant,
and, as she herself said, "hungry
as a bear." She gave glowing
accounts to Martha of her success,
and begged to be allowed to try the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
experiment again on the morrow.
Some of the boys, she remarked, evidently
"took her measure;" but after
trying a little impertinence, they gave it
up as a bad job, and every thing went
as well as Martha could have desired.
For three days, Margaret kept this
up, and gained the hearts of even
the most obdurate of her scholars.
How delighted she was with her success!
At the end of that period, as
old Mr. Burney had grown better,
Margaret's school duties came to a
close.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XIV.<br />

MARGARET'S COURAGE.</h3>

<p>It was early spring. The buds
were swelling, the birds beginning to
sing, and a week of mild weather
had filled every one's heart with a
longing for out-of-door life, when an
excursion was planned by a few of
the Sealing young people, to a wild
and beautiful spot called the Glen, a
few miles inland, a favorite resort for
picnic parties. There were a dozen
in all, and they were to go in a large
open wagon with four seats, and
take their provisions with them. It
was the custom of the place for the
young men to have the nominal getting-up
of these excursions; that is,
they incurred the expense of the
"team" and the trouble of invitations,
while the girls prepared the
eatables. There was always to be
an equal number of ladies and gentlemen;
the couples were arranged
beforehand, and each youth was in
duty bound to devote himself to his
companion unremittingly, during the
drive and at the place of the picnic.</p>

<p>Dr. James had agreed to join this
party, an almost unheard-of thing for
him to do, and the committee of arrangements
had assigned him to Margaret,
as her escort. This was disinterested
on the part of the other ladies;
for although they were not supposed
to have a voice in the distribution of
the gentlemen, their influence was
certainly felt, as one or two of the
committee very conveniently had sisters,
who gave their advice at home,
and communicated to their intimate
friends the results of their important
deliberations. It was disinterested
in them, then, to allow Miss Lester
to have as her escort the doctor, who
was a great favorite, and by far the
most desirable man, in the towns of
Sealing and Shellbeach combined, for
an escort, a partner, a husband, or
what not. Added to this, it was
quite an honor to have him devote
so much of his precious time to their
picnic; he was, in fact, the lion of
the party, and perhaps no one else
could have been selected for his companion
without exciting disapprobation,
to say the least, in the minds of
many of the others. So it seemed to
be a wise as well as a magnanimous
plan which gave to Margaret the
privilege of the exclusive attention of
Dr. James for one whole afternoon.</p>

<p>A perception of the state of the
case dawned upon her, as the great
wagon stopped at Miss Spelman's
door, and she inwardly smiled when,
after seeing her contribution to the
feast safely packed away, she took
her place between the doctor and a
young man, who was usually accounted
for as being "in the bank," though
what office he held in that important
institution was left rather uncertain.</p>

<p>She resolved to repay the politeness
of the rest of the party by making
herself generally agreeable, and monopolizing
her escort as little as possible.
In this she succeeded admirably, and
the whole company were in high
spirits and enjoying themselves to
the utmost when they reached the
Glen, and began to walk through
pastures and over rough and broken
ground, before reaching the bed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
the brook, where the picnic proper
was to be held. All the provisions
were set down on the high, flat rock
which answered for a table, and then
the party broke up into couples, as
the girls expressed their inclinations,
some to sit down on the rocks and
others to explore the woods or follow
up the stream to its source.</p>

<p>Margaret, to whom every thing
was new and interesting, wished to go
through the Glen, and proposed that
they should climb the wooded bank
above them, follow the stream through
the woods, and return by the rocks.
Dr. James was very willing, and they
set out on their scramble up the bank,
and then along the edge, catching at
branches or roots of trees for support,
and slipping frequently on the wet
last year's leaves and damp earth. It
was all fun to Margaret; she laughed
with an almost childish delight at
every difficulty, refused all assistance,
and kept generally ahead of her companion,
who seemed inclined to take
the rough climbing more leisurely,
and was not enraptured when the
treacherous leaves landed him in a
hole, or a seemingly firm bough which
he grasped gave way in his hand,
and almost made him lose his balance
and fall.</p>

<p>At last the head of the Glen was
reached; a turn had hidden the rest
of the party from them, and their
voices sounded faint and distant.</p>

<p>"Now we will go down to those
lovely green meadows," said Margaret.
"But, O Dr. James! what is
that?"</p>

<p>"Only a bridge across, made of a
great pine log. You see the top has
been smoothed."</p>

<p>"A bridge! Then it is meant to
be crossed. Come, let us cross it."</p>

<p>"Certainly, if you wish. I have
been foolish enough to cross it before,
and am willing to do so again."</p>

<p>"Why was it foolish?"</p>

<p>"Because it is dangerous. It is
only a few steps across, I acknowledge.
But look down; how would
you like to fall among those rocks?"</p>

<p>At this moment three or four of the
party came round a huge rock which
had hidden them from sight, and evidently
noticed the two standing by
the bridge.</p>

<p>"You need not try to frighten me,
Dr. James; my nerves are not easily
shaken. Come, shall I go first?"</p>

<p>"If you please. Your stick may
be a sort of balance-pole; imagine
yourself on the tight-rope, and look
steadily at that little tree before you;
don't look down. I am in earnest,
Miss Lester."</p>

<p>Margaret looked at him, laughed,
and stepped on the little bridge. The
people who were looking at them
were frightened, and the girls turned
away their faces. Margaret made
three steady steps, then paused.</p>

<p>"Do you see what a lovely green
that water is, just below us?"</p>

<p>Two steps more and her stick
dropped, she staggered, and put her
hands to her head.</p>

<p>"I am falling!"</p>

<p>But she felt a strong hand on each
of her shoulders, and a voice of command
said,</p>

<p>"Fix your eyes on that tree, and
walk straight on." She obeyed, and
three more steps brought her to firm
ground. Instantly, almost before her
feet touched the bank, the doctor
withdrew his hands, and without a
word, with a displeased and gloomy
face, preceded her down the bank.
He was saying to himself,</p>

<p>"Now we shall have a scene, and
she will say she owes her life to me,
and call me her preserver, or some
such nonsense."</p>

<p>Margaret leaned for a moment
against the little tree she had been
told to look at so steadfastly, and then
followed her companion through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
woods. He walked so fast that she
was soon out of breath trying to
overtake him. When she had done
so, she said in a low voice,</p>

<p>"I am vain and contemptible. I
despise myself more than I can express.
Forgive me for giving you so
much trouble."</p>

<p>Dr. James turned; his face was
clear, and he smiled upon her with a
smile that was sunshine itself; he did
not reply, but walked slowly by her
side, then stooped, and holding something
out to her, said,</p>

<p>"See, here are the first flowers; the
little hepatica ventures out before all
the rest. Will you take it? How
pretty it is! how delicate the colors
are; and the stem is covered with fur.
Notice the green and brown leaves,
too; they add to its beauty and singularity.
It is my favorite flower."</p>

<p>The deep flush in Margaret's face
had died away, and her voice had
resumed its usual tone when they
joined the rest of the party, and sat
down to the feast; but her gayety
was gone, and it seemed as if nothing
could recall it. She was abstracted
and serious, and not in accordance
with the merriment around her. At
last she arose, and went to a rock, on
which she leaned, and watched the
little minnows darting about in a green
pool of water, when she was startled
by the doctor's voice close beside
her. He held toward her a small
silver tumbler, filled with iced claret
and water, and said in an undertone,</p>

<p>"Miss Lester, how can you let a
trifle weigh so on your mind, and
cloud all your enjoyment?" He was
smiling in a friendly way; but she
looked at him reproachfully, and said,</p>

<p>"How can you call it a trifle? It
might have cost me my life."</p>

<p>"You are right," he replied gravely;
"nothing ought to be called a trifle
whose consequences might be serious;
though attendant circumstances make
us look at the same thing in such
different lights at different times. On
the bridge, and when I felt angry
with you afterward, your conduct
seemed to me a most weighty matter;
now I can with difficulty recall any
thing except the honesty and courage
of your apology. Having seen and
humbly acknowledged your fault, will
you not now confer a favor on the
whole party by forgetting what is
past?"</p>

<p>Margaret smiled, and saying, "I
will, at least, forget myself," accompanied
him back to the party.</p>

<p>She did her part very well, and,
owing in a great measure to her
efforts, the rest of the picnic and the
moonlight drive home were quite as
pleasant as the setting out had been.</p>

<p>"She is a brave woman," the doctor
said to himself that night in his
study; but Margaret was quite unconscious
that his opinion of her had
been raised instead of lowered, by the
occurrences of the picnic party at the
Glen.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XV.<br />

A CHANGE.</h3>

<p>This little mortification&mdash;and it
really was one to Margaret's high
spirit, owing to her anxiety to stand
well in Dr. James's opinion&mdash;should
have been a lesson to her to give up
contradicting him, and opposing her
own will to his, and for a time it was
so; and yet that very wish to please,
of which she was conscious and
ashamed, made her often dispute
with and appear to oppose him,
when she would have liked to agree
and do as he advised.</p>

<p>She began to realize something
else, too, that had the effect of making
her surround herself, as it were,
with an armor of prickles and thorns;
so that her intercourse with the doctor
was far from peaceful or pleasant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
She felt that the work she was doing
among the poor was wholly with and
for Father Barry; she was helping
him, not Dr. James; and this, she
felt, was the doing of the latter, and
not without a reason. At first, when
he had recommended her to take the
priest as her adviser, she had felt a
cooling of enthusiasm; still, having
said she meant to persevere, she
would not draw back.</p>

<p>It would have been sweet to her,
she knew it now, to help the doctor;
to be his friend, confidant, coadjutor;
to feel that she was making his labor,
which she revered and sympathized
with, easier and pleasanter. But he
had made that impossible; he had
directed her to go to some one else
for help, for counsel, for support,
while he stood alone as before, and
had never again applied to her for assistance
for his patients, though she
had once or twice asked if she could
not relieve them. She understood
the pride which prevented him from
accepting her money, or placing himself
under obligations to her. "He
does not like me well enough to let
me help him," she said to herself;
and she soon abandoned all those
efforts to make herself agreeable to
him, which at first came so naturally
to her.</p>

<p>The picnic lesson, therefore, though
by no means forgotten, had ceased to
influence her actions; and when the
real spring-time came, with mild air,
and young, fresh green, as May drew
to its close and June was at hand,
Margaret had managed to quarrel
with Dr. James several times, and
had made herself unhappy and him
far from comfortable. He began to
come less often to his old friend, Miss
Spelman's, and to hear less of Margaret's
plans and doings.</p>

<p>Miss Selina was much puzzled at
the turn things were taking, and yet,
when they disputed, she was half the
time uncertain whether they were in
fun or in earnest; and it did no good
to remonstrate with Margaret; for the
incomprehensible girl agreed with all
she said, and acknowledged the doctor
to be perfectly right.</p>

<p>The friendship with Martha Burney
continued, however, and at her
house Margaret always appeared to
the best advantage, even before Dr.
James. She seemed to stand somewhat
in awe of her older friend, and
was desirous to please; and besides,
she had made a kind of agreement
with herself that when she met the
doctor there, she might allow herself
to be as pleasant and conciliatory as
her inclinations led her to be. She
was in a peculiar frame of mind, and
this curious compromise can be better
described than explained.</p>

<p>In the mean time, old Mr. Burney
gradually became more and more
feeble; soon he lost his mind to such
a degree as not to be able even to
recognize his faithful daughter; and
at last, early in May, he died. Margaret
could not understand how
Martha could grieve as she did at his
loss; knowing his character and former
misdoings, and seeing him a
broken-down, witless old man, the
daughter's sorrow seemed to her unreasonable;
but when Martha talked
of him as he was once, when his wife
was living, handsome and brave and
generous, the idol of those two fond
women, it made her think of her own
dear and noble father, lying alone in
his quiet resting-place in the little
Swiss graveyard, and she found she
could give the sympathy and comfort
which before were impossible.</p>

<p>His death made little apparent
difference. Martha, after the funeral,
went quietly on with her school duties,
till she "could think of something
more useful to do," she said;
and her little household was as quiet
and homely as usual, only, as it seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
to other people, much pleasanter.
But Martha said,</p>

<p>"Oh! it was such a difference;
she could not work with half the
spirit now that it was only for herself;
she had always had some one to

<h2>THE SANITARY TOPOGRAPHY OF NEW YORK CITY.</h2>


<p>The rapid growth of New York
City is at present exciting universal
interest throughout the country; and
as a place of residence, or in a business
point of view, it would be difficult
to over-estimate the vast advantages
it possesses. Nature has lavished
upon the island its choicest
gifts; surrounded on one side by the
East and Harlem rivers, on the other
by the beautiful Hudson, the "Rhine
of America," as an entirety, its advantages
for natural drainage and
general healthfulness cannot be surpassed.
But eighteen miles from the
Atlantic Ocean, with an admirable
harbor, the nations of the earth
already vie with each other in pouring
into the lap of this infant giant
their most costly productions and
most beautiful works of art. It is
now the most populous city and the
greatest commercial emporium of the
western hemisphere, and stands with
its youthful vigor a proud rival of the
largest cities of the old world. With
the vast undeveloped wealth of free
America, and the energy and ambition
of her sturdy sons to press it
forward, is it not easy to foreshadow
the prospective importance of this
metropolis of the Union?</p>

<p>But one subject of uneasiness presents
itself in this glance at the future,
and that is the rather limited space
which nature's barriers have allowed
us, and which threatens eventually
to stop the progress of the city.
"Manhattan Island is but thirteen and
one half miles long, and has an average
width of one and three fifths
miles. This gives an area of twenty-two
square miles, or fourteen hundred
acres."<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>We may consider the city as pretty
solidly built up as far north as Fifty-ninth
street, the border of Central
Park. The census of next year will
probably show the population to
number between thirteen and fourteen
hundred thousand souls; and
the rate of increase is estimated to be
between six and seven per cent per
annum. Thus the population of the
island in 1880 will number far above
two millions, and the city be extended
as far northward as Ninetieth
street. There are but "37,244 lots
of full size, that is, twenty-five by one
hundred feet, between Eighty-sixth
and One Hundred and Fifty-fifth
street."<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
This shows conclusively
that before many more such decades
of years roll round, every available
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
portion of the island will be built
upon, and our further expansion apparently
prevented. But this, we
hope, will be obviated by the erection
of the East River bridge, and other
modes of rapid transit to our sister
city, Brooklyn, and the Jersey shore;
thus enabling us to bring within our
limits all the territory that will be required.</p>

<p>For the present, the rapidly increasing
number of our commercial
houses and the consequent greed for
space shown by trade in the lower
part of the city, as well as our constantly
augmenting population, show
conclusively that the better class of
residents now occupying locations
south of Thirty-fourth street will be
obliged to look elsewhere for homes.
That this is to be the case no one
can doubt, who has studied the progress
of business marts in their up-town
march, during the last two years.
The invasion of Union Square, the
magnificent buildings on Broadway
between Eighteenth and Nineteenth
streets, the "Grand Hotel," and, more
than all else, the appropriation of the
lower end of Fifth Avenue for public
galleries, attest this fact, and warn us
that no prominent location below
Thirty-fourth street will, in a short
time, be safe from the all-powerful
grasp of this insatiable demand. With
this fact before us, the question arises,
What portion of the island offers the
greatest prospective permanency for
private residences, and at the same
time the best inducements for the
happiness and physical well-being of
the people?</p>

<p>That tract of the island bounded
on the south by Thirty-fourth street,
on the east by Lexington avenue, on
the west by Sixth avenue, and on the
north by Fifty-seventh street, is undoubtedly
very desirable property;
but with our rapid growth it is impossible
to tell what it will be twenty
years hence; and besides, we are lured
past this portion by the many advantages
offered by the section north
of it.</p>

<p>We have now before us the Central
Park, extending from Fifth Avenue
on the east, to Eighth avenue on
the west; and stretching out in picturesque
beauty from Fifty-ninth to
One Hundred and Tenth street. To
the east and west of this, we find topographically
a very different character
of country. On the east side from
Fifty-ninth to Ninetieth street, the
surface is very uneven; in some parts
ledges of rock run up one hundred
and twenty feet above tide-water,
and then abruptly descend into valleys
almost on a level with tide-water;
and here are found the beds of old
streams, so many of which formerly
rolled their sluggish waters through
this portion of the island into the
East River. The general fall is eastward,
though not sufficiently so to
make natural drainage into the river
good. From Ninetieth street to the
Harlem River, we have a perfectly
flat plain; unbroken, with the exception
of Mount Morris Square, by any
marked elevation. The land lies but
little above tide-water, and presents
every appearance of being to a great
extent "made ground." This supposition
is further strengthened by the
alluvial character of the soil. Many
suppose that a branch of the Hudson
once flowed across the island at Manhattanville
to Hell Gate; but we believe
that originally the upper portion
of Manhattan was a distinct island,
and have no doubt the waters of the
Hudson washed freely between the
two, and in time the amount of soil
gradually deposited on either bank
limited and eventually closed the
gap, thus giving us our present formation.</p>

<p>On the west side of the park we
have a very different topography.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"From Fifty-ninth to One Hundred and
Fourth street, the Eighth avenue is nearly
the central ridge of the Island. Its average
height is twenty to thirty feet above the
Fifth avenue. At Fifty-ninth street, the elevation
of the Eighth avenue above the tide-level
is seventy-six feet four inches, increasing
to ninety feet at Seventieth street,
reaching one hundred and twenty feet at
Eighty-fifth street and one hundred and
twenty-two feet at Ninety-second street;
descending, it is eighty-nine feet at One
Hundred and Fourth street, and gradually
falls off to the general low level of Harlem
plains.</p>

<p>"At One Hundred and Sixth street, the
ridge extends north-westwardly, leaving the
Eighth avenue, running nearly along the
Ninth avenue to One Hundred and Twentieth
street; then bending westwardly, and
forming the southern hill-side of the Manhattan
valley to the Hudson River. The
new grade of the Eighth avenue already
established, by keeping up elevations and
filling depressions, will gradually ascend
to and then descend from its summit at
Ninety-second street, and make the finest
possible grade for any avenue on the
island."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>To appreciate, one must see the
romantic beauty presented by the
bold bluff of rocky formation against
which the crystal waters of the Hudson
dash in ceaseless waves and
eddies. At points forming ascents
from seventy to one hundred and
forty feet above tide-water, it stretches
away, with varying elevation and
constantly changing scenery until
it reaches Manhattanville. There,
as if to make space to cradle the
village in its rocky embrace, for a
few blocks it disappears, only to rise
in more stately proportions beyond,
forming its crowning glory of landscape
grandeur at Washington Heights.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There is a high table-land between the
Eighth and Ninth avenue ridge on the east,
and the Hudson River bank on the west.
The surface of this table-land is broken; it
has high rocky ridges and mounds in central
locations reaching these elevations. At</p>

<p>"Between these elevations, which (except
a central ridge or terrace between the Ninth
and Tenth avenues from Seventy-ninth to
Ninety-fourth street) are not generally continuous,
are numerous hollows and valleys,
the lowest having an elevation of fifty to
sixty feet above the tide-level. The average
elevation of this plateau is as much as seventy-five
feet; in the more northerly portion,
as much as one hundred feet. The
surface drainage from this plateau finds its
way to the river, through the valleys above
indicated, at Sixty-seventh, Eightieth, and
Ninety-sixth streets."<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>With a view to the prospective
physical health of the city, the authorities
should do every thing possible
to destroy the extensively prevailing
malaria found in it, which
emanates from the large tract of made
ground along the East River, and
from the beds of the original streams,
which covered acres of land in the
primitive state of the island. Few
people fully comprehend the insidiousness
of this poison which affects the
system in such a variety of ways and
shows such erratic developments that
at times the skill of the physician is
baffled in attempting to detect its
presence. It is rendered more permanent
in many locations by the
miserable condition of the sewers,
and, where these have not been
built, by the irregular grading of
streets forming obstructions to the
natural drainage of the soil. Again,
in many places where sewers have
been provided, as along the course of
Seventy-fourth street between Third
and Fifth avenues, they do not seem to
entirely prevent the generation of the
poison, as intermittent and remittent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
fevers are still rife in the surrounding
districts: not properly filling up the
beds of the streams in many of these
cases may, however, account for this.</p>

<p>Owing to its rocky formation, malaria
has found a home in but few
locations in the north-western section
of the city; and if these are examined,
they will generally be found to be
lots which, by the grading of the
streets, have been made lower than
the side-walks. When these are properly
filled, the deleterious influence
they exert will disappear. In addition
to this, the level of this section
is so much above tide-water that it
possesses every advantage for natural,
and, when that does not prove sufficient,
every facility for promoting artificial,
drainage.</p>

<p>According to the report of the
Board of Central Park Commissioners
for last year, "the prevailing
winds for the year were west and
north-west." Let us see what comparative
difference this makes to the
two sections of the city under consideration.
The west side receives this
wind in all its bracing freshness directly
after it has passed over the
Jersey highlands, on the opposite
side of the Hudson. It carries before
it all the exhalations from this
side toward the east, and imparts a
healthful vigor to all who come within
its influence. The east side, being
so much below the level of the west,
receives but little of the benefit to be
derived from this wind. Again:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When the mercury in the barometer
rises, the smoke and injurious emanations
are quickly dispelled in the air. When the
mercury lowers, we see the smoke and
noxious vapors remain in the apartments
and near the surface of the earth. Now,
every one knows that, of all winds, that
from the east causes the mercury in the barometer
to rise the highest, and that which
lowers it most is from the west. When
the latter blows, it carries with it all the
deleterious gases it meets in its course from
the west. The result is, that the inhabitants
of the eastern parts of a city not only
have their own smoke and miasmas, but
also those of the western parts brought by
the west wind. When, on the contrary, the
east wind blows, it purifies the air by causing
the injurious emanations to rise, so that
they cannot be thrown back upon the west.
It is evident, then, that the inhabitants of
the western parts receive pure air from
whatever part of the horizon it comes.
We will add, that the west wind is most
prevalent, and the west end receives it all
fresh from the country.</p>

<p>"From the foregoing facts, M. Junod
lays down the following directions: First,
persons who are free to choose, especially
those of delicate health, should reside in the
western part of a city. Secondly, for the
same reason, all the establishments that
send forth vapors or injurious gases should
be in the eastern part. Thirdly and finally,
in erecting a house in the city, and even in
the country, the kitchen should be on the
eastern side, as well as all the out-houses
from which unhealthy emanations might
spread into the apartments."<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The absence of foliage is a great
disadvantage in malarious districts,
and here the east side of the city enjoys
a marked superiority over the
west in the ample and rich character
of its soil, which, with proper cultivation
would produce trees of luxurious
foliage. On account of the small quantity
and the poor quality of the soil in
many locations in the north-western
section of the island, trees are not as
numerous as they should be; but it
becomes only a greater duty to foster
those we have, and to constantly increase
their number by planting others
in every desirable location. Too little
regard has in all ages been paid
to that beautiful harmony established
by the wisdom of God in nature, and
but few persons consider how essential
the vegetable kingdom is to animal
life. With each inspiration of air
which we draw into our lungs to obtain
oxygen, a certain amount of blood
is purified, and throws off its carbon.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
This carbon is rapidly absorbed by
plants, and nurtures them; and in return
they liberate the oxygen which
is absolutely necessary for our being.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Plants absorb their food entirely in a
liquid or gaseous form, by imbibition, according
to the law of <i>endosmosis</i>, through
the walls of the cells that form the surface;
as when liquids of unequal density are
separated by a permeable membrane, the
lighter liquid or the weaker solution will
flow into the stronger with a force proportionate
to the difference in density; but at
the same time a smaller portion of the
denser liquid will flow out into the weaker,
which process is called <i>exosmosis</i>. The
fluid absorbed by the roots is thus carried
from cell to cell, rising principally in the
wood, and is attracted to the leaves, or other
parts of the plants exposed to the sun
and light, by the exhalation which takes
place from them, and the consequent inspiration
of the sap. Here the crude sap is
exposed to sun and light, and assimilated
and converted into organizable matter."<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Man, in his ruthless desire to utilize,
according to his weak appreciation,
every thing placed within his power,
destroys the very breastworks against
disease and death with which the
foresight of the Creator has surrounded
him. Many instances are recorded
where the removal of a grove
of trees has rendered entire villages
for ever afterward a prey to the
innumerable miseries produced by
malarial poison. This fact has been
recognized from the earliest days,
and demonstrated so clearly by experience,
that the more intelligent
inhabitants of rural districts, where
marshes abound, build their homes
so that winds passing over them, and
consequently laden with their pestilential
exhalations, shall be intercepted
by some belt of forest-trees. Many
parts of Italy would be uninhabitable
without the protection of its luxurious
vegetable productions, and it is
well known that the citizens of Rome
are thus shielded from the south-west
wind passing over the dreaded Pontine
marshes. The salutary influence
of foliage is not felt in the case of
malaria alone; observers have noticed
the comparative immunity from
epidemic diseases also enjoyed by
those whose homes are thus protected.
During the prevalence of cholera
in Burlington, Iowa, in 1850,
this was strikingly demonstrated.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the houses on the west side of Main
street, north of Court, more deaths took
place than in any other portion of the city;
and more occurred, in proportion to the
number of inmates, in every other house
than in the one in front of which were trees,
and, what is still more convincing, the natural
predisposition to cholera existed to a
greater extent among the inmates of this
house, than in any other. Another and
more striking instance occurred in the two
houses nearest the 'old saw-mill.' The
house adjoining the mill was surrounded by
trees, and not one of the occupants suffered
from cholera; while, in the other house,
which was exposed, and stood upon the
bank of the Mississippi, three deaths took
place; and what is more to the point, the
family which escaped were new-comers,
and suffering from <i>nostalgia</i>, and the effects
of a change of climate, which act as a predisposing
and exciting cause of the disease;
while those who lived in the other house
were old residents, and had been thoroughly
acclimated. Dr. Buckler notices similar
facts in his account of the cholera, as it
appeared in the Baltimore Alms-house, in
1849."<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Trees are useful to us in another
respect; they moderate temperature.
In winter, the heat of the earth is
constantly ascending their trunks to
be given to the air. It is well known
that large forests decidedly lessen the
intense cold, and, in summer, moderate
the extreme heat, by the great
amount of moisture which they exhale
from their leaves. Again, who
has not felt the happy influence a
forest has upon the mind? How our
petty troubles melt away, and our
hearts expand with grateful homage,
when we listen to the tuneful harmony
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
of æolian sweetness, as the feathered
songsters of the grove, and the passing
breezes rustling through the verdant
foliage unite to form nature's
orchestra, wafting upward one grand
strain of praise to the Deity. And
when, in the autumn of our lives,
borne down by blighted hopes and
ruined ambition, we seek the forest's
solitude, every fitful breeze sounds a
low wail of sympathy, falling in gentle
cadence on the crushed heart.</p>

<p>The young growth of the trees
is particularly noticeable in Central
Park, and in this respect it will be
many years before we can rival Druid
Hill Park near Baltimore, where the
grand old trees, raising their majestic
heads toward heaven, seem whispering
to every passing zephyr hymns
of adoration. Here, art may carve
meandering roads, span the crystal
streams with elaborate bridges, erect
statues in honor of man, decorate
and adorn to suit the taste of the
most fastidious; but high above all
these, the majestic oaks wave their
luxuriant foliage, and assert the superiority
of the works of the Creator
over the imitations of the creature.
Thus it needs but a moment's consideration
to see what a material advantage
to our comfort, physical well-being,
and happiness trees are; and
to understand why our broad avenues
should be bordered with them,
and their growth fostered as much
as possible in our parks; and we
may rest assured that succeeding
generations will bless us for the forethought
which will add so much to
the beauty and healthfulness of our
metropolis.</p>

<p>The eastern portion of all large
cities is devoted to manufacturing
purposes, and New York presents no
exception to this almost universal
rule. By reason of the comparatively
level and easily graded character
of the east side, buildings were
rapidly erected along the line of the
Second, Third, and Fourth avenues;
and the suburban villages of Harlem
and Yorkville have been most remunerative
to property-holders on that side
of the park. The easy access to the
points above named by the city railroads
has drawn that kind of capital
which invests in good substantial tenant-houses.
These pay sufficiently
well to prevent their being demolished,
even with a prospect of better pecuniary
results from a higher class of
property; and thus are always an
obstacle in the way of first-class improvements
in a neighborhood.</p>

<p>The east side possesses a great
many advantages which will in time
increase its commerce, and render its
entire river-side most valuable. Already
numbers of manufactories, lumber-yards,
and other business places
occupy nearly the entire water-front
as high as Fiftieth street; and the
easy approach to, and gentle slope
of its bank offering great facility for
landing merchandise, will rapidly increase
their number toward the northern
extremity of the island. Again,
should the attempt to relieve Hell
Gate of its dangerous rocks be successful,
a new era of prosperity will
dawn for the East River shore, and
every foot of its extent at once receive
increased valuation. Piers will
spring into existence, and vessels of
every description bearing the precious
wares of every clime, will seek
this hitherto inhospitable channel,
and thus lessen their tedious voyage
by at least two hundred miles.</p>

<p>North of Fifty-ninth street on the
west side, with the exception of the
squatter's shanty, removable at a few
days' legal notice, there is nothing to
impede the numerous and beautiful
improvements designed by the Central
Park Commissioners, to whose
judgment this work is intrusted.
These improvements consist in laying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
out parks and public drives, and in
adding in every possible way to the
natural advantages of this section.
First, at the intersection of Broadway,
Eighth avenue, and Fifty-ninth street
we will have the Circle, with a radius
of two hundred and sixteen feet.
This will provide at once an opening
to the grand Boulevard, and also
add to the beauty of the entrance at
this point to Central Park. The
ground around this circle will undoubtedly
present one of the finest
positions in the city for public buildings,
and will become as valuable for
this purpose as that in the neighborhood
of Union Square. In this connection
we would express a hope
that the commissioners will reconsider
the great mistake they have made
in closing Sixtieth street between
Eighth avenue and the Boulevard,
thereby cutting off the view of the
park and its grand entrance from the
residents of that street. It would
add much to the finish of the circle,
and the beauty of the approach to
the park, if Fifty-ninth street retained
to either river the width it has between
Fifth and Eighth avenues.
Eventually a ferry will be established
at either extremity of this street, for
the accommodation of persons desiring
to visit the park; and this with other
circumstances, combines to make it
very desirable that it should be one
of the wide streets. Several efforts
have been made to have the Belt Railroad
running on this street removed
to Fifty-eighth street, but so far without
success. As this change is desired
by the property-owners and residents
in the neighborhood of the park, it is
hoped it will be effected by the Legislature
during their session this winter.</p>

<p>From the north-western portion of
the circle issues the boulevard mentioned
above. This will be in reality
the extension of Broadway, and is
designed to be one hundred and fifty
feet wide, with twenty-two feet of its
central portion reserved for a grass-plot,
to be bordered on either side with
shade-trees. It will extend along
the line of the old Broadway road
"crossing Ninth avenue at Sixty-fifth
street and Tenth avenue at Seventy-second
street, and then passing about
midway between the Tenth and
Eleventh avenues to One Hundred
and Fourth street, where it bends to
the westward, following the line of
the Bloomingdale road, and strikes
the Eleventh avenue at One Hundred
and Seventh street, and then follows
the Eleventh avenue to One Hundred
and Fifty-fifth street. Beyond
One Hundred and Fifty-fifth street it
continues as a part of the improvements
of the Fort Washington district,
which are now being carried
out by the commissioners under the
law of 1865,"<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
framed for this purpose.</p>

<p>Then we have the Zoölogical Garden,
which is considered a portion of
Central Park, and which is to occupy
the space bounded by Seventy-seventh
street on the south, Ninth
avenue on the west, Eighty-first
street on the north, and Eighth
avenue on the east. It should properly
be extended, taking in the
same blocks from Seventy-seventh
to Eighty-first street, as an arm
of the park, and crossing the intervening
avenues and boulevard by
arched bridges, to the Riverside
Park, which skirts the Hudson.
This last will be one of the most
beautiful improvements on the island.
Commencing at Seventy-second
street, with the rocky highland, it
continues along the bank of the
Hudson as far north as One Hundred
and Thirtieth street. It will be
bounded on the east by the new
River-bank avenue, which runs along
the crest of the highland, and is to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
one hundred feet wide, and on the
west by Twelfth avenue. It is difficult
to imagine a more charming variety
of scenery than this park must
present from its many prominent
points. A continuous view of the
Hudson for miles will be seen, with
the bold highlands of New Jersey on
the opposite shore, and the limpid waters
of the river adding variety to the
charming landscape. Turning toward
the north, Fort Washington looms
up in grand proportions against the
distant horizon, covered with rich foliage,
and studded here and there with
princely mansions. Glancing eastward,
the park, with its charming
intermingling of natural and artificial
beauty, stretches away toward the
East River in endless variety of lawn,
shrubbery, and pebbly pathway;
while to the south a grand panoramic
view of the island city is presented,
with its myriad towers and steeples of
public buildings and of churches, all
attesting the prosperity and wealth
of the people. We hope the Park
Commissioners will consider the extension
we have above suggested. If
made now, its expense would be light
in comparison with the increased value
of the property bordering the proposed
connections; while the combination
of the two parks, the boulevard,
and the Zoölogical Garden would
form a succession of grand pleasure-grounds
such as no city of the world
can now boast of.</p>

<p>We have still to mention Morningside
Park, which is to commence at
One Hundred and Tenth street, and
extend as far north as One Hundred
and Twenty-third street. It will be
somewhat irregular in form and its
southern portion will be bounded on
either side by one of the new avenues,
and the northern extremity by Ninth
and Tenth avenues. It is most fortunate
that the original intention of
cutting down the grade of the streets
in this section has been changed, and
the matter left to the option of the
Central Park Commissioners. We
may rest assured that excellent taste
will harmonize their improvements,
and every notable point be reserved
for some artistic design, and
thus no natural advantage be destroyed
which would add to the
beautiful symmetry of the whole.</p>

<p>During the progress of these vast
improvements a permanent system
of sewerage should be devised for the
comfort and convenience of the inhabitants
of this district. At present
this could be readily effected, as in
many parts of the boulevard, Eighth
avenue, and side streets, the grade
will have to be raised several feet
above the present level. This is particularly
noticeable in the boulevard
in the neighborhood of Eighty-fourth
street, where the old Broadway road
must lie twenty feet below the grade
of the grand drive. It should also
be a question as to the kind of sewer
to be adopted. We are convinced
that throwing away the contents of
our sewers is an irreparable error, as
all the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i> passing through them
should be used as a fertilizing agent.
Throughout the country, but more
particularly in the South, is the reckless
abuse of the soil noticeable.
Our farmers sow and reap their crops
year after year until the earth is worn
out, and loses its productive power;
then they seek new fields. Our territory
is so vast, that the effect of this
wretched mode of farming has not as
yet been felt; but it must be, sooner
or later. In many parts of Europe,
the same ruinous policy has been
pursued, and now the inhabitants are
obliged to import guano to sufficiently
revivify their impoverished land to
raise even the lightest crop. We are
happy to see that some of our public
men have had their attention drawn
to this fact. Senator Sprague in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
recent conversation said, "We are
rapidly exhausting our virgin soil,
without furnishing it the means of
recovery in the shape of fertilizers,
and extending our railroads to new
tracts as fast as we wear out the old
cultivated ones." If we could deodorize
the material from our sewers,
and put it to practical uses, we would
be gainers in many ways. In the
first place, our piers would be relieved
of the enormous quantity of decomposing
matter which may constantly
be seen festering under the
sun's rays, and emitting pestilential
exhalations; and secondly, a vast
amount of valuable fertilizing material
would be garnered from this
large city, which would go far toward
enriching the lands around us;
and we may add that this experiment
has been tried, and proved not only a
success, but also highly remunerative.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Sewerage has been advantageously deodorized
and applied to agricultural uses in
localities in England, where it could not be
conveniently discharged into the sea, by the
process of Mr. W. Higgs, of Westminster,
which consists in collecting it in large tanks
and admitting with it a stream of lime-water,
the effect of which is to cause the precipitation
of the organic matter with the
phosphates, urates, sulphates, etc., and the
expulsion of any free ammonia. Through
the cover of the tanks the ammonia and all
gaseous matters are conveyed by a pipe
into a convoluted chamber, where they are
fixed by various chemical reagents, and preserved.
The tanks, when full, are allowed
to remain undisturbed for an hour, when
the liquids are drawn off clear and without
odor. The pulpy sediments are then collected
and dried, and rendered fit for the
market. The expense of the process was
rated at £1 per ton, and the manure thus
prepared was sold at Cardiff for £3 per
ton."<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It is an unquestionable fact that
through the sewers of cities enormous
quantities of the constituents of
plants are conveyed into the sea, and
unless saved and restored to the soil,
the loss must be made up from other
sources, or the lands become impoverished.
From the London sewers, refuse
matter is thrown into the river
Thames; and so fearfully does this
immense body of filth pollute its waters
that it has been found necessary
during warm weather to neutralize the
impurity and destroy the foul gases
by throwing large quantities of disinfectants
into the river, costing the
city as much as "£20,000 in the
summer of 1859." They are now
constructing an addition to their sewers
which will carry their contents
along the course of the river eight
miles to Barking, into a reservoir a
mile and a half long, and about one
hundred feet wide by twenty-one feet
deep. From this reservoir it will be,
at high-tide, discharged, through numerous
large pipes, into the middle
and bottom of the river, at the depth
of sixty feet below the surface.
"The estimated cost of this vast
work is about £4,000,000, and the
time fixed for its completion five
years."<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>As the river Seine divides the city of
Paris into two parts, so it divides the
sewers into two districts, which formerly
emptied their contents respectively
on the right and left bank of
the river. In order to prevent the
infection of the water of the river, the
main sewer of the left bank was
made to pass its contents through a
tunnel under the river, and empty
them at Asnières, the same point
where that of the right bank emptied,
thus avoiding the current which
washed the discharged material back
upon the city.</p>

<p>Thus we see that the disposition of
sewerage has always been a question
of great import, even to cities situated
on large streams of water, into
which it could be turned. While proposing
a system for at once doing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
away with the nuisance caused by it,
and at the same time utilizing it for
fertilizing purposes, we are happy to
add that it is not the first time the
plan has been brought forward for
New York. Professor Lewis A. Sayre
during his administration as Resident
Physician of this city, had regular
plans drawn up and calculations
made as to the cost of the entire
work; and also what return could
with certainty be expected from the
investment. The designs were made
by the late John Randall, of Maryland,
one of the ablest civil engineers
the country has ever produced.</p>

<p>The professor's idea was, to have
the street excavated for some twelve
feet below its grade. A substantial
wall of masonry was to be built on
either side to sustain the sidewalk,
and a convex iron girder was to cross
the entire width of the street, upon
which the pavement could be laid.
Within the inclosure thus made, the
sewer, water, and gas-pipes could be
placed, and trap-doors arranged at
certain distances to make it possible
to get at them without disturbing the
pavement. Here could be carried
on a vast laboratory for deodorizing
the contents of the sewers. His plan
also embraced a sort of trap by which
the yard of each house communicated
with the main sewer, and an arrangement
by which the fluid portion
was allowed to drain away from the
solids, which in turn were to be
dumped from the temporary reservoir
in which they were received into
a small car at the bottom of the excavation,
and then carried to the
laboratory by a regular railroad intersecting
every portion of the city.</p>

<p>This general plan of subterranean
sewerage may strike the eye of the
uninitiated as very expensive; but
when we consider the manipulation
a street is subjected to from the time
its boundaries are defined by the
surveyor, until it has been handed
over to the city as complete, by the
last contractor, we think the plan will
appear in a very different light. In
the first place, take a street that requires
filling up to a certain specified
grade. Sealed proposals or bids are
received from contractors for the work,
and the party making the most advantageous
offer obtains the contract,
and in due course of time completes
the work. Then, in all probability,
a second party obtains a contract to
at once put down some kind of pavement.
After this, houses are built
upon the street, and a sewer must be
laid. This completed, the gas and
Croton mains must be put down.
Then each house must have separate
sewer, gas, and water connection.
Thus the pavement is perpetually
torn up and relaid, each removal
rendering it more unfit for travel.
Why not, when the street was low
enough to lay the sewer without turning
out one shovelful of earth, put
in the pipes for the sewer, gas, and
water, and leave the laying of the
pavement until it could be done without
having it torn up four or five times
for necessities which every one knows
will arise? Let any one calculate the
vast sums of money spent on a street,
in these various changes, and we are
sure the amount will be larger than
the cost of the plan above proposed,
with this great difference, that when
the work is completed, in the latter
case, a yield of from six to seven per
cent upon the outlay could be at
once expected, while in the former
there would be constant call for additional
expense in repairs. Where
the grade of a street requires to be
raised several feet, it is doubtful if it
would cost much more to put up the
two walls of masonry and the iron
girders than it costs to fill up the
space with earth and rocks. Contractors
pay from forty to seventy-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
cents per load for this filling;
and every one knows how very few
square feet the carts used for this
purpose hold. Again, the question
of an underground railroad has been
much discussed during the past few
years. With this plan of sewerage,
it would be no more expensive to
carry such a railroad over the entire
city, worked from given points by
stationary engines and wire ropes, as
is proposed for the overground railroad,
than to lay such a road in the
streets of the city; excepting that
arrangements would have to be made
at certain distances to enable passengers
to go down to platforms below,
for the purpose of entering the cars.
This project would at once put into
the hands of the city authorities a
subterranean city, and also the vast
revenues to be obtained from its underground
railroads, and does not
present half the difficulties that must
have been experienced in bringing
the Croton water across the Harlem
River.</p>

<p>Having shown that nature has particularly
favored that portion of the
city which lies west of the park, and
that, from present indications, the
highest art will prevail in the magnificent
improvements which are there
going on, we will mention another
cause, which will add weight to the
many reasons already adduced, why
it should in the future become the
home of the fashion and wealth of
the metropolis. If we look at the
great capitals of Europe, we will notice
the general tendency the affluent
classes have shown to select their
abodes in the western sections of
these cities. Paris, London, St. Petersburg,
Berlin, and others show
this conclusively. In each, the western
section is covered with the elegant
palaces of the rulers and the
costly mansions of the rich; while on
the east side is found the bustling
activity of the work-shops and manufactories.
In a translation from <cite>Le
Correspondant</cite> published in the April
number of this magazine, the writer,
speaking of this subject, says,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In visiting the ruins of Pompeii and
other ancient cities, I have observed, as
well as M. Junod, that this custom dates
from the highest antiquity. In those cities,
as is seen at Paris in our day, the largest
cemeteries are found in the eastern parts,
and generally none in the western. M.
Junod, examining the reason of so general
a fact, thinks it is connected with <i>atmospheric
pressure</i>.</p>

<p>"M. Elie de Beaumont has since mentioned
some facts which tend to prove the constancy
and generality of the rule laid down
by M. Junod. He noticed in most of the
large cities this tendency of the wealthy
class to move to the same side&mdash;generally,
the western&mdash;unless hindered by certain
local obstacles. Turin, Liège, and Caen
are examples of this. M. Moquin-Tandon
has observed the same thing at Montpellier
and Toulouse."</p></blockquote>

<p>In the first part of this article the
influence of "<i>atmospheric pressure</i>"
was fully spoken of, as also the effect of
the winds so favorable to residents
on the west side. With these facts
in view, it is easy to foresee that those
who possess means will always purchase
homes in this portion of the
city, which offers the best security
against disease and the greatest guarantee
for continued physical health.</p>

<p>It is curious to go back to the
commencement of the present century,
and to note the changes in location
the growth of the city has obliged
the wealthy to make since that
time. In the early days, State street,
and then Bowling Green, offered to
this class attractions superior to those
of any other portion of the city. The
ample shade of the latter, its stately
forest-trees, verdant lawn, and beautiful
walks, with the refreshing sea-breeze
constantly blowing in from
old ocean, and the magnificent moving
panorama in the harbor, made
it a great favorite of our forefathers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
They whiled away their time in this
charming resort, smoking their pipes,
and watching the merry gambols of
the children. It may be, they canvassed
the future of this goodly city,
which under their thrifty influences
already promised well, never dreaming,
however, of the gigantic growth
its future was to develop. In time
this garden spot changed into the
great <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrepôt</i>, where emigrant ships
daily landed vast numbers eager to
obtain employment and homes in this
new country where every thing promised
wealth and happiness. Greenwich
street next absorbed within its
precincts the votaries of fashion; soon
after, it had for rivals in public favor
East-Broadway and College Place.
They, in turn, were deserted for the
location between Fourth and Eighth
streets. But the same agency being
at work here as below, soon brought
Union Square into requisition. After
this, Fifth and Madison avenues became
the grand centres of the opulent
classes; and to-day the entire
course of the former, with its long
line of brown-stone architecture and
regal grandeur, attracts the attention
and challenges the admiration of the
world. But after this avenue reaches
Ninetieth street, its grade descends
rapidly to the low level of the Harlem
plains, and is no longer so desirable
for residences. At the rate it is
now being built upon, it will soon be
completed to this point, and then in
what direction will this current turn?
The Harlem Railroad will always
prove an insurmountable objection to
Fourth avenue, which is behind it;
and it does not require a prophet's
power to foresee that the Grand
Boulevard, the garden parks overlooking
the Hudson, and the great aids to
general healthfulness possessed by
the west side, will prove sufficiently
attractive to cause the next move to
be in the direction of the beautiful
sites which border these improvements.</p>

<p>The proposed widening of Broadway
from Thirty-second to Fifty-ninth
street adds certainty to this prediction.
We think it most unfortunate
that this change did not commence
as low down as Seventeenth street,
and we hope it may yet be found advisable
to do so. We would then
have a noble thoroughfare starting
from the Battery, crossing the various
avenues diagonally until it reached
the beautiful circle at the Eighth avenue
entrance to the park; and then
continuing as the Grand Boulevard
to the upper extremity of the island.
This measure, which seems to meet
with the disapprobation of a large
portion of the community, if carried
out, would, we are convinced, prove
a crowning glory to the metropolis;
and it is but fitting that the thoroughfare
which is to vie with any other in
the world should have a continuance
in the lower part of the city worthy
its princely magnificence; for it would
then be a subject of pride not only
to us but to the whole country, which
would regard it as a national ornament.</p>

<p>We may also look forward to an
ever-increasing commercial importance
for the east side, with its long
line of piers fronting the harbor, always
filled with vessels bearing the
flags of every commercial nation of
the world.</p>

<p>Its shore will be covered with capacious
warehouses and immense
manufactories, from which will resound
the noisy bustle and unceasing
activity of trade.</p>

<p>A glance at the residences in the
different locations mentioned above,
as being at various times the homes
of those possessing wealth, will show
that each successive change has been
marked by an increase in the lavish
expenditure of means for the purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
of producing architectural display.
With this fact before us, we may form
an idea of the palatial houses with
which, by means of their rapidly increasing
wealth, the rising generation
will crown the hill-sides of the western
section.</p>

<p>When the proposed improvements
for this portion of our city have been
completed, the whole, bounded on
the one side by Central Park, with its
many natural and artificial beauties
appearing like a fairy-land, and on
the other by the dancing waters of
the Hudson, will give to our metropolis
attractions superior to those
possessed by the most celebrated
cities of Europe.</p>

<h2>THE BASILICA OF ST. PETER.</h2>

<p class="center">TRANSLATED FROM <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">LES ETUDES RELIGIEUSES,
HISTORIQUES ET LITTERAIRES</span>.</p>


<p>While visiting, two or three
months since, the Vatican Basilica, it
seemed to me there was a certain
correspondence, a kind of harmony,
between this monument and the great
event of which it is soon to be the
theatre. Since that time new observations
have strengthened this first
impression; then reminiscences of a
different kind, the perusal of various
works, unfortunately too limited in
numbers, and especially a more attentive
examination of St. Peter's, have
had the effect of defining more clearly
what at first was only a vague and
confused perception.</p>

<p>Before my pilgrimage to Rome, I
was so fortunate as to visit one of the
cities which had for a long time been
the objects of my most ardent curiosity.
I refer to the humble Tyrolean
city where, more than three hundred
years ago, was held the last and most
glorious of the general councils.
The city of Trent presents nothing
extraordinary to the eye of the traveller
except, perhaps, a kind of trident
of mountains which gives it its name,
and which forms around it a group
of natural fortifications truly grand.
Certain monuments, among others the
cathedral of a Roman style, and
somewhat interesting, appeared to
merit some attention. But that which
attracts and interests the Catholic
heart in the most lively degree is the
church where the holy &OElig;cumenical
Council held its immortal sessions.
It bears the name of St. Mary Major,
the same as the great Roman basilica
so generally known and venerated.
In truth, this renowned title is hardly
appropriate, if the dimensions of the
edifice and its architectural merits
alone are considered. In these respects
it more nearly resembles our
modest Parisian church of Notre
Dame des Victoires. This comparison,
without being wholly just, may
yet give a good idea of the sanctuary
rendered illustrious by the Council of
Trent.</p>

<p>As to the local traditions respecting
this august assembly, a sojourn far too
short prevented me from collecting
them as fully as I could have wished.
According to the information of a respectable
priest with whom I conversed
a short time, a great revival of faith,
the effects of which are still visible,
took place in the city on the third
commemorative centenary in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
month of June, 1863. This same
ecclesiastic likewise informed me that
the memory of our great Laynez has
always been dear to the popular memory,
and that the greatest eulogium
that can be passed upon a man who devotes
himself to works of charity is
to compare him to that indefatigable
apostle. Probably his learned discourses
are nearly forgotten even in
the places where they were delivered;
his preaching is only remembered because
of his deeds, a new proof, among
so many others, in support of the
divine word, "Wisdom passeth
away, ... but charity shall never
pass away."</p>

<p>Not far from the entrance of Santa
Maria Maggiore is a monument,
erected in 1855 for the first anniversary
of the proclamation of the
dogma of the Immaculate Conception.
It bears a statue of her "who
has destroyed all heresies throughout
the world," and for whom the fathers
of the Council of Trent formally
stipulated an exception in the decrees
respecting the doctrine of original
sin. I noticed in the interior of the
church a painting representing one
of the reunions of the council, and
especially the crucifix which stood on
a table in the centre of the nave and
presided, so to speak, at those solemn
assemblies. This crucifix may now
be seen above one of the side altars.
It is regarded with extreme veneration
by the faithful. I will not attempt
to depict my emotion in celebrating
the holy mysteries before this sacred
image with the same chalice the cardinal
legate had used, which was
kindly loaned me by the venerable
chaplain. You can easily imagine
that the place, the circumstances, and
those precious relics, without mentioning
my own inclinations, imposed it
on me as a duty to offer up the holy
sacrifice for the success of the approaching
council.</p>

<p>On the whole, the city of Trent
and the sanctuary of the council do
not fully correspond with the solemn
grandeur of the event which took
place therein. It is unnecessary to
say that this kind of contrast does not
shock in the least a mind at all familiar
with objects connected with the
faith. This want of correspondence
is frequently to be noticed even in
a more striking degree. The least
supernatural eye soon forgets the
whole edifice and these material objects
only to behold the great Christian
wonders once wrought within so
small a space. We say to ourselves,
with profound emotion, that this is the
cenacle of modern times&mdash;a real cenacle,
in truth, where the light of the
Holy Ghost was diffused more abundantly
than had ever taken place since
the day of Pentecost.</p>

<p>Without any great effort of the
imagination I could see a figure of
the religious renovation produced
by the holy Council of Trent in
circumstances, wholly accidental, that
occurred at the time of my journey.
It was during the latter part of the
month of October. On the way
from Botzen the country had been
ravaged by an inundation of the
Adige. Everywhere was a scene of
desolation sad to behold. The following
morning, on the contrary, just
as we were starting for Italy, a glorious
sun rose over the city of Trent. The
bold summits that surround it were
crowned with such lights as are only
seen in mountainous countries. Clouds
of magic brilliancy hung here and
there over the deep gorges and on the
heights, the fields had resumed their
joyous and smiling aspect, even the
traces of the inundation were less sad
to behold, and our eyes could linger
with a pleasure almost without alloy
on the magnificence of nature.</p>

<p>The council of the nineteenth century,
for which preparations are now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
being made at Rome and throughout
the civilized world, cannot be less
fruitful than that of the sixteenth
in the regeneration and salvation of
souls. The gravest reasons on every
hand appear to justify this hope, and
perhaps it is allowable to find a significant
sign of it in the happy
choice of the place where this great
court of Catholicity is to be held.
At all events, the basilica of St. Peter
is certainly the most suitable theatre
in the whole world in which to assemble
an &oelig;cumenical council. Every
thing about it is marvellously
adapted to this purpose; every thing
seems to reveal a preconceived harmony
that divine Providence is so
often pleased to manifest in the accomplishment
of his august designs.
In speaking thus, I only express differently,
if I am not mistaken, the
idea of Sixtus III. in the fifth century.
This pontiff, having convoked
in the ancient basilica of St. Peter a
certain number of bishops, wrote to
Cyril, the patriarch of Alexandria, to
announce this synod, and, among
other things, wrote these remarkable
words: "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ad beatum Petrum Apostolum
universa fraternitas convenit.
Ecce auditorium congruens auditoribus,
conveniens audiendis</i>."<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
"The whole
brotherhood meets at the tomb of
blessed Peter the Apostle. Behold a
place befitting both the hearers and
the things to be heard."</p>

<p>It cannot be doubted that this suitability,
so well understood by Sixtus
III., also occurred to Pius IX., when
he designated the tomb of St. Peter
as the rendezvous of his brethren in
the episcopate. It seems to me desirable
that an inscription in a conspicuous
place should bear the fine
expression of Sixtus III. Its meaning
and adaptation with regard to the
approaching council would be more
strikingly apparent than they could
have been at the particular synod of
the fifth century.</p>

<p>Let us now enter this august temple
and regard with admiration, as we
pass, the colossal portico and the vast
nave, whose length and height cannot
at once be taken in by the unaccustomed
eye. Almost at the extremity
of the nave, at the right, is the bronze
statue of St. Peter, which for more
than fourteen centuries has received
the homage of pilgrims. Let us not
forget to prostrate ourselves after
their example, and press our trembling
lips to the feet of the apostle,
literally worn by the pious kisses of so
many generations. A few steps further
on, and we stand before the
Confession, that is, the glorious sepulchre
of the first vicar of Jesus
Christ, around which a hundred lights
do not cease to burn night and day.
After kneeling for a few moments, not
without being penetrated by a powerful
but sweet emotion which stirs
the soul to its very depth, let us rise
and look first at the superb baldaquin
of gilded bronze which rises to the
height of eighty-six feet over the
grand altar and the tomb of St. Peter.
Above bends over us "the Pantheon
raised in the air" by the genius
of Michael Angelo&mdash;the incomparable
dome, measuring one hundred and
thirty feet in diameter, and four hundred
and twenty-six feet in height on
the outside.</p>

<p>If, from this central point of the
basilica, we look to the right, we see
the northern transept extending more
than one hundred and sixty feet from
the Confession. The altar at the end
is consecrated to the Saints Processus
and Martinian&mdash;two Roman soldiers,
at first jailers of the apostle St.
Peter, and then his disciples, baptized
by his own hand. "From that time,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
says the Abbé Gerbet, "the remembrance
of these two saints has constantly
clung to that of St. Peter,
their master and their friend, as the
shadow follows the body." Martyred
the same year as he, they were
buried near the Aurelian way, not far
from the Vatican. The antique statue
of St. Peter, now venerated in the
basilica, was formerly in a monastery
connected with the cemetery where
these two martyrs reposed. It was
afterward placed in the oratory which
Pascal I. had erected in their honor
in the ancient Vatican basilica, whither
he had their relics transported.
The ashes of these two jailers of St.
Peter always in a manner gravitated
around him, until, placed here at his
side, they have become for ever his
acolytes in this magnificent crypt, as
they were his guardians in the dark
dungeons of the capitol.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>Another glory is in reserve for
Saints Processus and <ins title="Original reads 'Maximian'">Martinian</ins>. Before
their altar and in the spacious
chapel which is dedicated to them
are to be held the solemn sessions of
the council. Let us hope with firm
assurance that these faithful guardians
of the first pope, and his immortal
acolytes, will keep invisible
guard around his successor, and
around the bishops, his brethren,
when they are reunited in this sanctuary
to continue the work of the
great Fisher of Souls.</p>

<p>Returning from the altar of Saints
Processus and <ins title="Original reads 'Maximian'">Martinian</ins>, before resuming
our place by the Confession,
let us notice at the left, at the end of
the Gregorian chapel, the tomb of
Gregory XVI. and the marble statue
with his hands raised to bless. Connected
with him many interesting
thoughts came into my mind. He is
the last of the popes who joined the
church triumphant. His tomb and
that of St. Peter, so near each other,
bring before us the two extremities
of the great chain of apostolical succession
which extends back from our
own age to the first Christian era.
The intermediate links are known to
us all through the authentic records
of history, and they are represented
here almost entire under our eyes.
Look first at the tombs and statues
of the greater number of popes since
the commencement of the sixteenth
century. It is sufficient to name a
few of them. There is the funereal
monument of Pius VI. at the foot of
the staircase leading to the Confession.
He merited this post of honor,
as has been justly remarked, because
he was "the first pope who
died from the martyrdom of exile
and captivity after the construction
of the new basilica." Two other
pontiffs, Benedict XIV. and Clement
XIII., are entombed close by the
transversal nave where the council is
to be held. They will be there on
each side of the august assembly&mdash;the
double personification of clerical
learning and pontifical firmness.
The throne of Pius IX. will almost
touch the tomb of Clement XIII.
A little further on, in the southern
nave, is the monument of one of the
greatest pontiffs of the seventeenth
century&mdash;that of Innocent XI., the
firm antagonist of Louis XIV. At
the end of the choir, or apsis, the
sixteenth century is represented by
Paul III. His tomb is at the right
of the symbolic chair of St. Peter,
which is supported by the four great
doctors. He also was worthy of
this privileged spot; for his name is
indissolubly connected with what have
been called "two of the greatest providential
events of modern times,"
(and I can say that the expression is
certainly true of the first of these:)
he convoked the Council of Trent,
and was the first to give his approval
to the formation of the Society of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
Jesus. Among the tombs of the
pontiffs of the fifteenth century we
select at hazard those of Sixtus IV.,
Nicholas V., and Eugenius IV., all
three rendered illustrious by the great
events of their pontificates. The
ashes of the two last are in the subterranean
church of the Vatican.
Only six or seven tombs represent
the preceding ages in the upper
church. They are those of St. Gregory
the Great, St. Leo the Great,
Sts. Leo II., III., IV., and IX.
The crypts spread before us a much
longer list. Conspicuous therein is
Boniface VIII., the pontiff who declared
the first jubilee of the fourteenth
century; and then, going back
into the preceding ages, Alexander
III.; Calixtus II.; Urban II., the
first organizer of the Crusades; St.
Nicholas I., one of the men who
merited by the most brilliant claims
the title of great; Adrian I., the
friend of Charlemagne, and celebrated
by him in that immortal elegy
so worthy of the great pope and of
the great emperor, and still to be
read in the portico of St. Peter's; St.
Agatho, made glorious by the sixth
&oelig;cumenical council, held at Constantinople;
Honorius I., the beautiful
inscription on whose tomb so
eloquently avenges undeserved calumny;
St. Boniface IV., who consecrated
the Pantheon; and then a great
number of other glorious pontiffs, till
we come to St. Simplicius, the second
successor of St. Leo the Great. Dating
from the latter, there is an interruption
of more than two centuries in
the pontifical sepulchres of the Vatican.
The popes of this time repose
in the catacombs, particularly in that
of St. Calixtus. But until the year
202 all the others, with the exception
of St. Clement I. and of St. Alexander
I. in going back from St.
Victor to St. Linus, the immediate
successor of St. Peter, have been deposited
near the Prince of the Apostles
in the place where St. Anacletus,
even in the first century, constructed
"the memorial of the blessed Peter
called the Confession," according to
the expression of an ancient inscription
on the walls of this sacred crypt.
When a portion of the pavement was
removed in order to construct the
monument of Pius VI., the bones of
the first successors of the apostle
were exposed. Their faces were
found turned toward his tomb.</p>

<p>Altogether, the Vatican basilica
and its crypts contain the tombs of
about one hundred and forty popes.
Let us not fail to remark that almost
all the others are in the catacombs,
or the neighboring churches; only a
small number of popes have been
buried out of Rome. We have then
here, without going out of St. Peter's,
the greater part of that dynasty
which is the most ancient and the
most glorious in the history of the
world. I refer to the privilege it
possesses&mdash;and it alone&mdash;of tracing
a succession, uninterrupted and of
incontestable legitimacy, back to him
whom Jesus Christ established as
head and foundation of the universal
church. Some slight shadows, I
know, seem to hover here and there
over certain links in this descent of
eighteen hundred years, but this cannot
disturb an unprejudiced mind for
a moment. The glory of the whole
line diffuses too powerful and subduing
a light for that! Where is the
rival church that can show in its history,
in its monuments, its temples,
and even in its tombs, a succession,
a connection, an antiquity, and a
proof of catholicity, worthy, I will
not say of equalling, but of being
compared with this? Christian tradition,
the liturgy, the frequent language
of schismatical churches themselves,
are agreed in giving the pope
the name of Apostolic. This name,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
as well as that of Catholic, of which
St. Augustine boasted with such good
reason against the Donatists, would
alone be a strong title in favor of
Rome. At all events, it is the unique
and incommunicable privilege of the
Roman Church to have been built upon
the foundation of the apostles&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">super
fundamentum apostolorum</i>. And this
expression of St. Paul, which has not
perhaps been sufficiently noticed, is
verified at Rome with a fulness of
evidence truly wonderful. It has, in
truth, pleased Divine Providence to
consecrate this church in the eyes of
all with the special characteristic of
apostolicity, to collect within its walls,
if not the entire bodies of all the
apostles of Jesus Christ, at least considerable
portions of their relics. A
part of the bones of St. Paul repose
fraternally beside those of St. Peter
in the Vatican, and, as if to attest
more strongly the brotherhood of
these two founders of Christian
Rome, a part of the body of St. Peter
has been transported to the basilica
of St. Paul beyond the walls,
and their skulls are placed together
at St. John Lateran; both thus
taking possession of the three great
basilicas of Rome. The bodies of
Sts. Simon and Jude are also at the
Vatican. Those of St. James the
Minor and St. Philip are in the Church
of the Holy Apostles, that of St. Matthias
at St. Mary Major, and that of
St. Bartholomew in the basilica that
bears his name. Different churches
at Rome possess important relics of
other members of the apostolic college,
as well as of St. Mark and St.
Luke. One apostle delayed longer
than the rest joining this rendezvous
of the glorious dead, and yet it was
only proper, it would seem, that he
should be near Simon Peter, for it
was his brother in the flesh, his elder
brother. But this vacancy was at
last filled up by the agency of Him
who directs all human events. Toward
the middle of the fifteenth century,
Thomas Paleologus, King of
Peloponnesus, fearing that the head of
St. Andrew, preserved until that time
in Achaia, would fall into the hands
of the Turks, wished to preserve it
by confiding it to the Roman Church.
At this news great was the joy of the
magnanimous pontiff whose name,
destined to cast such brilliancy over
succeeding ages, was just becoming
renowned. Pius II., in order to receive
this precious relic, had a procession
and ceremonies of extraordinary
solemnity, an enthusiastic description
of which has been handed
down to us in the annals of that
time. The sacred head, which the
Saviour of the world "had more than
once, without doubt, touched with
his hands and with his divine lips,"
(these are the words of Pius II., in
an admirable discourse on this occasion,)
was placed not far from the
tomb of St. Peter, where it remained
till a sacrilegious hand dared to carry
it away from its sanctuary for a time.
But, as is known, Pius IX. had the
joy of finding it some days after with
the seals intact, and henceforth the
homage of the faithful will not cease
to offer reparation for the outrage
committed.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
To increase devotion
toward St. Andrew, a unique privilege,
which had its origin in the
delicate inspirations of Christian
sentiment, has long been granted
to him; the colossal statue of
the brother of the Prince of the
Apostles stands before the altar of
the Confession, and on a level with
the three great statues which recall
the precious relics of the Saviour's
Passion.</p>

<p>Thus, it is evident, the apostolic college
is in a manner assembled in the city
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
of Rome. "The legend, according to
which all the apostles assembled together
to witness the last moments
of the Blessed Virgin, has in a manner
been verified as to their mortal
remains around the tomb of St. Peter.
The first council of Jerusalem
seems to be held here permanently."<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>This idea appears to me to give
an admirably beautiful significance
to one of the most solemn prayers
of the liturgy which is chanted at
the mass of the apostles and especially
on the festivals of Sts. Peter and
Paul. Imagine that we hear resounding
the voice of Pius IX., of a compass
and harmony equal to the basilica
itself, which it fills with its powerful
undulations. Listen to this
prayer which he addresses the eternal
Shepherd: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gregem tuum, Pastor æterne,
non deseras, sed per beatos apostolos
tuos continua protectione custodias; ut
iisdem rectoribus gubernetur quos operis
tui vicarios eidem contulisti præesse
pastores.</i> "Desert not, O eternal
Shepherd, thy flock, but through the
blessed apostles grant it thy unceasing
protection; that it may be governed
by those rulers whom thou
hast appointed to continue thy work
and to be the pastors of thy people."
Does it not seem that the truly providential
presence of the sacred relics
of all the apostles at Rome is like a
continual reply of Jesus Christ to the
supplication of his high-priest? Or
raise your eyes toward the radiant
dome, as Pius IX. often loves to do
while he is chanting, and while the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sursum corda</i> of his soul is manifested
by his looks, do you not behold
the mosaics gleaming there on high
like celestial apparitions? See the
eternal Shepherd who does not cease
to watch over his flock, and around
him his blessed apostles, his vicars
on earth, who now from the highest
heavens continue to protect and govern
the lambs and sheep of the divine
fold.</p>

<p>I have not yet had the great Christian
joy of assisting at the festival of
St. Peter in the basilica itself; but
on another occasion I experienced
in the same place, leaning against
the balustrade of the Confession, a
joy almost comparable. It was on
Palm-Sunday, when the choristers of
the Sistine chapel made the arches resound
with the grand and solemn affirmations
of the Catholic Credo. I shall
never forget the quiver that passed
through my frame when I heard resounding
these simple words as they
were taken up one after another: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">et
unam&mdash;sanctam&mdash;Catholicam&mdash;et apostolicam&mdash;ecclesiam</i>
... "and one&mdash;holy&mdash;Catholic&mdash;and
apostolic&mdash;church."
Then my eyes were irresistibly
attracted toward the dome,
and through the light which at that
moment flooded it I had a sight of
the glorious figures with which it is
adorned, and which appeared to me
like a reflection of the church triumphant
in the heavens. Then I recalled
the gorgeous procession I had
just seen pass through the grand nave
of the basilica&mdash;Pius IX. borne on
his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sedia Gestatoria</i>, and before him
the imposing <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cortége</i> of cardinals,
bishops, and prelates, all bearing in
their hands the triumphal palms&mdash;and
it seemed to me that this immense
inclosure expanded to a still larger
size, or rather, its walls vanished and
gave place to the church universal
dispersed in the four quarters of the
globe, but all bound to the tomb of
St. Peter, in perpetual communion
with him, receiving from him by a
constant influence its divine characteristics
of unity, sanctity, catholicity,
and apostolicity, living by his faith
and his love, ruled and governed by
his authority, and always spiritually
present where he is to be found, according
to the words of St. Ambrose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
the truth of which I had never comprehended
so fully, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ubi Petrus, ibi
ecclesia!</i> "Where Peter is, there
is the church."</p>

<p>But let us leave these retrospective
ideas and evocations, and rather endeavor
to discover in the basilica of
St. Peter the visible signs of unity,
sanctity, and catholicity, as well as of
apostolicity, the authentic marks of
which we have just noticed.</p>

<p>And first, let us read around the
dome these words in colossal letters
on a golden ground of mosaic, <span class="smcap" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tu
es Petrus; et super hanc petram
ædificabo ecclesiam mea; et tibi
dabo claves regni c&oelig;lorum.</span> "Thou
art Peter; and upon this rock I will
build my church; and I will give to
thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven."
And a little lower on the frieze,
above the two pillars of the choir,
these words recently placed on a
similar ground, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hinc una fides mundo
refulget</i>, "Hence one faith shines
upon the world;" to correspond with
which these other words are hereafter
to be engraved above the opposite
pillars, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hinc sacerdotii unitas exoritur</i>,
"Hence the unity of the priesthood
arises." There is a symbolic commentary
on this last inscription in the
urn placed on the tomb of St. Peter.
It contains the palliums which the
pope sends to the metropolitans.
They are kept in this place to signify
that that is the origin and source of
all jurisdiction and all ecclesiastical
authority. This urn and these inscriptions
are sufficient to make us
understand the whole mystery of
Catholic unity. This unity, indeed,
is comprehended in the decisive
words which established Peter as the
foundation of the church and confided
to him the keys of the kingdom
of heaven. Peter thus became the
true representative of Jesus Christ
and the personification, so to speak,
of the divine authority. And he
himself in his turn transmitted this
plenitude of power to the Roman
pontiff, his successor, his inheritor,
his universal legatee, thus living
again, as it were, in his successor, investing
him with his authority, and
communicating to him by a continued
operation the full and entire power
of feeding, directing, and governing
the universal church, according to
the dogmatic definition of the Council
of Florence. From this centre of
power the apostolic authority extends
through all ranks of the hierarchy,
and by a wonderful ubiquity is diffused
without being weakened to
the lowest grades of the Catholic
priesthood. Patriarchs, primates, metropolitans,
archbishops, and bishops
throughout the world are all armed
with the plenitude of this authority;
all derive from this source their jurisdiction
and the legitimate exercise
of their rights; all, as they love to
acknowledge, govern their own
churches "by the grace of God and
of the apostolic see." And this is
why throughout the church there is
the same government, the same doctrine,
the same administration of the
sacraments and divine worship. There
is but one rule of government; for, as
Bossuet (who was always incomparable
when the whole truth illumined
his soul) has somewhere said, "There
is such a sympathy in all parts of the
body of the church, that what each
bishop does according to the rule
and spirit of Catholic unity, the whole
church, the entire episcopate and the
chief bishop, does with him." There
is the same doctrine; for the Roman
see teaches all others, and these
again all the faithful, or, to express it
better, the different grades of teachers
(it is still Bossuet who speaks) "have
only one doctrine, by reason of the
necessary connection they have with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
the chair which Peter and his successors
have always occupied."<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
Finally,
the administration of the sacraments
and the divine worship are the
same; for the central authority of Peter
intervenes in some manner in all
the sacramental functions, whether to
render them legitimate, or, as is seen
in the ministry of the confessional,
to make them efficacious and valid;
and besides, it is only in communion
with Peter that God accepts the offering
of the divine sacrifice as well as
all other acts of worship and prayer.</p>

<p>The perfect unity that reigns in the
hierarchy and the government of the
church engenders a not less perfect
unity in the entire body of the faithful.
Indeed, all the members of the
church are reunited and bound together
by means of the central authority
of Peter, always present in the
pope, and, through him, in all the
representatives of the episcopal hierarchy.
All the faithful recognize
this peculiar authority as that of Jesus
Christ. It is by submission and
obedience to it that they rise when
fallen. It is by faith in this authority
and its depositaries of every degree
that they receive the teachings of the
true faith. It is to this they have recourse
in order to be admitted to the
participation of the sacraments and
all the treasures of the church. And
thus all, whoever they may be, remain
attached to this authority by
the intelligence that affirms the same
truth, the will that observes the same
law, and the heart that draws from
the same sources of life; a unity of
faith, of obedience, and of the sacraments&mdash;a
triple unity realized by Jesus
Christ and his vicar, to whom all
hearts, all inclinations, and all minds
adhere as luminous rays to their centre
and source. It is true that this
adhesion has not among all the same
strength and efficacy; sometimes it is
purely exterior, and yet it exists in a
certain manner till the rupture is consummated
either by excommunication
or by manifest schism and heresy.
But, thanks be to God, the
number of the faithful is always immense
in whom this union is full and
entire. And they accomplish thereby
a mystery of unity still more close
and wonderful than that which we
have just considered. It is given to
the authority of Peter, who visibly
unites the faithful, to bind them also
together invisibly by the ineffable tie
of the communion of saints&mdash;the
crown and full consummation of unity.
But no; the vicar of Christ has
yet another privilege by virtue of the
power that he has received of binding
and loosing in heaven as well as
on earth&mdash;he opens the entrance to
the eternal mansions. The souls submissive
till the end to his authority,
and ruled by the power of his attraction,
rise and mount to become living
stones in the harmonious construction
of the celestial temple:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This vast edifice, even to the pediment, is composed

and skilfully joined together."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is thus that the gigantic edifice
of the Vatican dome, after taking root
around the tomb of the apostles,
springs up from the soil on its four enormous
supports, binding them together
by the key-stone of its vast arches,
and then, gathering itself together,
rises more and more resplendent,
more and more transfigured, till, at the
moment of uniting all its ascending
lines, it half opens to form a sublime
sanctuary around the Ancient of Days,
whose form beams forth from its very
top.</p>

<p>It is grand to assist in the basilica
of St. Peter at one of these solemnities
which are like splendid foreshadowings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
of the future state of souls in their
glorious union with God. Behold
around the choir the inscriptions engraved
on marble. They recall the
dearest and most solemn festival that
has yet been celebrated in our age&mdash;the
proclamation of the dogma of the
Immaculate Conception. That day
witnessed under these arches the triumph
of Catholic unity, as well as
the triumph of the Virgin conceived
without sin. The accounts of ocular
witnesses, still remembered by all,
have made us familiar with that great
manifestation of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cor unum</i> and
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anima una</i>, of the "one heart"
and "one soul," when, at a word
from Pius IX., the act of faith, full,
absolute, and unanimous, burst forth
in loving tones from the hearts of the
two hundred prelates and bishops,
and the multitudes of priests reunited
in this basilica, then resounded with
one accord from the souls of forty or
fifty thousand of the faithful likewise
assembled in the same church, and was
prolonged in repeated echoes from
the lips of the two hundred millions
of Catholics scattered throughout the
world. Since that time two or three
manifestations almost as glorious
have been made in this basilica, and
in all cases the great episcopal hierarchy,
represented by a vast deputation,
have inclined before the word
of their august chief, believing what
he believes, approving what he approves,
and condemning what he
condemns; and in all cases also the
universal voice of true Catholics,
whether present at Rome bodily or
only in spirit and in heart, has risen
to hail with one acclamation the infallible
decisions of the successor of
Peter.</p>

<p>But how can we forget the last
festival, so sweetly and deliciously
touching, which has just been celebrated
in this grand basilica? That
also was a brilliant manifestation
and triumph of unity; of that unity
the sweetest and most beautiful of
all others&mdash;that of brethren of the
great Catholic family around their
father and their pope, to celebrate
with him the golden wedding of his
old age so long and painfully tried,
but ever courageous and serene, and
always blessed by God. There were
mingled people of all ages, of every
condition, and, morally speaking, of
every race and nation on the globe.
And these representatives of all nations,
divided among themselves not
less by distance than by their interests,
prejudices, and hereditary enmities,
and perhaps&mdash;who knows?&mdash;on
the point of renewing old fratricidal
struggles, drawn in against their will
by the calculations of human policy&mdash;they
were all there, drawn together
and united by mutual love for their
common father! And doubtless there
was among them another source of
division. I refer to divergence of
opinions&mdash;opinions more or less correct,
more or less at variance with
the truth. There are always such in
the bosom of Catholic unity. But
admire the strength of this unity, remaining
still intact in the midst of
these elements of discord. We know
that every assent given to mere opinions
is necessarily conditional in this
sense&mdash;that every Catholic worthy
of the name is always ready to yield
them to the teachings of revealed
truth. Adhesion to the faith, on the
contrary, is absolute, without condition
or reserve, and moreover, this
adhesion extends not only to the
truths that the church requires us directly
and expressly to believe, but
also to the whole order of truths contained
in the depository of revelation.
What takes place, then, when the soul
of the believer finds himself clinging
to an erroneous opinion? That which
happens in the physical order when
two forces are in opposition to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
another&mdash;the more feeble is absorbed
by the overruling force. By virtue
of the same law of moral dynamics,
faith, which is an absolute affirmation,
neutralizes and absorbs an erroneous
opinion, which is only a conditional
affirmation; in other terms, the
latter is disavowed&mdash;retracted by the
very fact that he makes a genuine
act of faith. And this is how, among
Catholics, the unity of the faith
bursts forth and triumphs even in
the midst of the causes that would
seem to destroy, or at least to modify,
it.</p>

<p>You will not expect me to describe
this sacerdotal festival in detail. It
was at once solemn and grand, as
well as simple, popular, and affecting.
Besides, other accounts have made
you as familiar with all this as it is
possible to be with what is indescribable.
I will only select from the
wonderful whole one thing which perhaps
escaped general attention. It
was at the moment when the grandest
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te Deum</i> I ever heard was resounding
beneath the arches of the basilica
like the voice of the great deep.
When this verse of the Ambrosian
hymn was being chanted, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te per orbem
terrarum sancta confitetur ecclesia!</i>&mdash;"The
holy church acknowledges
thee throughout the whole
earth"&mdash;Pius IX. raised his hands to
his eyes as if to collect his thoughts.
It was as if his mind wandered off
from one hemisphere to the other&mdash;to
every region where there is a Catholic
church&mdash;and saw the entire world
communing in thought with him,
praying with him, and with him rendering
glory and thanksgiving to
God. And indeed, as you know,
at that same hour, millions of souls
scattered over the globe were united
in a general concert of prayer in order
to join themselves more completely
to him who was more than
ever the great Chief of Prayer, as
the savages of the new world sublimely
style the vicar of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>I can boldly declare that in no
time, no place, did any man, any
king and father of a nation, any pontiff,
perhaps any saint, have such an
ovation, such a manifestation of universal
love; and I say further that
this was not merely a triumph, but a
miracle of supernatural union in the
church&mdash;a miracle doubtless presaging
still greater to come.</p>

<p>I have said that this jubilee of
Pius IX. drew representatives from
the whole Catholic world to Rome.
The city of unity was on that day
also the city of Catholicity <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i>.
This last characteristic, however,
Rome does not manifest only
on extraordinary occasions, but permanently
by its physical and moral
position. "If a nation possessed a
cathedral surrounded by a portico to
which each province had furnished
an arcade or column which bore its
name, this monument would be a harmonious
emblem of the diversity to
be found in the unity of this people.
There is something analogous to this in
the Christian world." In the shadow
of the great basilica of the popes most
nations have their church, their festivals,
and their national tombs.
Each one finds some sacred monument
bearing on the history of his
country. Every one breathes here, in
the atmosphere of religion, his native
air. National establishments, reunited
in the same city by political or
commercial interests, represent concord
less than division. Counting-rooms
are rivals, altars are brethren.
This is one cause of the sentiment
that almost every one experiences
who lives for some time in Rome, far
from his native country. "Nowhere
does one feel so much at home as in
this city."<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
If one comes from a remote
province of Lower Brittany or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
from the extremities of Ireland, from
the depths of Ethiopia, the Indies, or
the two Americas, he finds everywhere
sanctuaries, tombs, institutions,
offerings <i>ex-voto</i>, and indeed all kinds
of mementoes that recall the far-off
country. The prelacy, the priesthood,
and the religious orders have
representatives from all countries.
The army itself has a cosmopolitan
character. You see there, under the
noble garb of the Zouave, the dark
skin of the African beside the white
face of the Dutchman or Canadian.
Whoever you may be, you are sure
not to be wholly isolated or unknown.
Soon a familiar accent or
an unforeseen accident will reveal a
compatriot or a friend. It is impossible
to forget your country; it becomes
dearer to you than ever.
You appreciate it perhaps more fully,
but the narrowness of your former
attachment is destroyed by contact
with the broad spirit of Catholicity
which penetrates you.</p>

<p>He who has the leisure to examine
certain statistics will find at Rome
evidences of Catholicity even in examining
the list of travellers, or the
missives of the mails, or even the catalogues
of gifts sent to the holy father,
and especially that of the offerings
he recently received for the jubilee
of his priesthood. All this and
many other things constantly verify
a proverb now misinterpreted, and too
trivial to be quoted, but which the ancients
expressed very nobly, "All
roads lead to Rome." There is this
difference&mdash;the roads leading to the
Rome of Sts. Peter and Paul are far
more extended than those of the Rome
of Romulus and Remus. What one
only accomplished by force of arms,
the other has effected by the universality
of evangelical preaching.</p>

<p>Without leaving the Vatican basilica
we can discover, on all sides, authentic
proofs of this universality.
On the day of solemn functions,
when the pope celebrates the holy
sacrifice, a Greek deacon officiates
beside a Latin deacon, and
chants the Gospel in the language of
St. Luke. A Greek archbishop also
assists at it as well as one of the Armenian
Church. The Syriac Church
has also its ministers at the holy see.
The presence of these bishops and
these priests of different rites is not a
mere spectacle unsustained by reality.
They are representatives of
churches scattered throughout the
East.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
We have many other reflections
to make on this subject, but
they must be reserved, with a thousand
things, till a future time. See
now, on the tablet that perpetuates
the remembrance of the formal decision
respecting the Immaculate Conception,
the names of the bishops
who were present. The titles of a
great number of their churches
would be vainly sought for in the ancient
diptychs. They assert the presence
of the Catholic hierarchy in regions
unknown to the fathers of Nice
or even of Trent. See, further on,
the confessionals ranged around the
southern transept; the inscriptions
they bear notify you that there are
penitentiaries and confessors who
speak all the principal languages of
Europe, including that of Greece.
Behold also a <i>bas-relief</i>, peculiarly
significant, under the statue of Gregory
XVI. It is symbolical of the
most glorious event of his reign&mdash;the
institution of the work of the propagation
of the faith. At the feet of the
pontiff are the types of almost all races,
who render him their tributes of veneration
and gratitude. There is another
idea under this symbol: it
shows that the see of Peter is the
source of the apostolic missions, the
centre of a power which is expansive
and subjugating, and the focus of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
that divine light which seeks to be
diffused throughout the entire heart
of humanity.</p>

<p>It is in truth from Rome that the
great evangelizers of nations have
set out. To mention here only a
few, and not the most ancient, Patrick,
the apostle of Ireland, wished,
as is said in his Acts, "to repair to
the see founded on a rock. He wished
to comprehend more fully the
canonical laws of the holy Roman
Church, and obtain for his mission
and his labors the strength derived
from the apostolic authority." He
came then to the tomb of the holy
apostles, and set out again with the
benediction of Pope St. Celestin I.,
as at a later date the monk Augustin
departed, sent by St. Gregory I. to
evangelize England. Another pope
of the same name, St. Gregory II.,
had the glory of conferring his blessing
on the monk Wilfrid, the great
apostle of Germany. He summoned
him to his presence in the church
of St. Peter, and consecrated him
bishop after having changed his name
to Boniface. After his consecration,
he placed in the Confession of St.
Peter a writing that ended with these
words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I, Boniface, an unworthy bishop, have
written with my own hand this paper containing
my oath of fidelity, and, in placing
it on the sacred body of St. Peter, I promise
to keep this vow before God, who is
my witness and my judge."...</p></blockquote>

<p>St. Corbinian, who was also one
of the first preachers of Christianity
in Germany; St. Amandus, who
preached on the shores of the Garonne,
the Escaut, and the Danube,
and St. Kilian, who evangelized Franconia,
came likewise to prostrate
themselves at the Confession of St.
Peter, whence set forth in other times
Paul, Formosus, Donatus, Leo, and
Marinus, sent by Pope Nicholas I.
among the Bulgarians; Egidius,
Bishop of Tusculum, sent to Poland
by Pope John XIII.; and Willibald,
Prochorius, etc., who received an
apostolic mission to Vandalia.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
Let us also mention St. Anscharius,
who was sent by Gregory IV. as legate
to the Swedes, Danes, Icelanders,
and all the northern nations. Two
other apostles who evangelized a
great race, now, alas! almost entirely
given over to schism, kindled their
missionary ardor at the tomb of the
Prince of the Apostles. After having
commenced their apostolic labors
among the Sclaves, St. Cyril and
St. Methodius came to Rome to
receive episcopal consecration, and
celebrated here the first mass in the
Sclavonic language.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
Then, their
second evangelical expedition being
terminated, they both returned to
Rome. One of them, Cyril, died
here, and his tomb, placed beside that
of Pope St. Clement, remains as a
perpetual memorial of his attachment
to the centre of unity and of Catholicity.</p>

<p>It would take too long to mention
here the names of all the other apostles
who set forth from Rome before
or after the most illustrious of all&mdash;St.
Francis Xavier. We will only remark
that the numerous pupils that
the Roman ecclesiastical seminaries
have sent on a mission never fail to
kindle their zeal at the Confession of
the Prince of the Apostles.</p>

<p>One of these seminaries requires
special notice, because it is in itself
a proof of Catholicity and of the principle
which engenders a Catholic
spirit. I wish you could have been
present, as I was, at the festival that
the Propaganda celebrated on the
Sunday in the octave of the Epiphany.
You would have heard speak or
chant in their own languages Greeks,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
Syrians, and I know not how many
from other nations&mdash;even a negro
from Senegambia, who was not applauded
the least, for, though his
<i>wolof</i> was understood by hardly any
one, his powerful and pathetic voice
made an extraordinary impression on
the whole audience. A composition
in verse, recited some years ago at
one of these exhibitions, sets forth in
a happy manner the peculiar character
of this house. Here is an extract
from it which you will not read without
pleasure:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>All races are here mingled. The Chinaman converses
with the surprised Turk, and Gambia is questioned
by Hindostan. The negro listens to the sweet
chants of Greece, and in this choir of voices, constantly
increasing, Providence has prepared a place
for the Bedouin of Algiers.</p>

<p>Rome, it is in thy bosom that this union is effected!
In the confusion of tongues which divides the
nations, harmony is restored by union with thee. All
souls join in thy universal hymn. The God of unity,
whom thou alone proclaimest, hears the same accent
of faith in our different languages.</p>

<p>Thy apostles, guided by thy star, go forth to every
shore where a vessel can land, to bind all nations to
their venerable head. Truth repairs the devastations
of sin, and Rome, sublime antipode of Babel, restores
the unity of the scattered human race.</p></blockquote>

<p>These verses quoted by the Abbé
Gerbet, and which he had, I think,
composed himself for that occasion,
express with a rare felicity this unique
character of Christian Rome,
which is the harmonious fusion of
Catholicity with unity. Besides, are
not these two prerogatives one and
the same thing under two different
aspects? For what is Catholicity
but a unity which expands and is
diffusive? And what is unity but
Catholicity drawn to its centre?</p>

<p>The name of Holy City, now synonymous
with that of Rome, implies
another characteristic, not less
brilliant, not less peculiar of the
church which is one and universal.
The Vatican basilica&mdash;for it is this we
are particularly studying&mdash;seems to
have been constructed and arranged
expressly to prove that the church is
the mother of the saints. Remember,
first, that this temple has been
for a long time the only sanctuary
used at the great festivals of beatification
and canonization. It is useless
to recall the ceremonies of this
kind that have recently been celebrated
here with so much solemnity;
but what is not useless to remark is,
that the public honors conferred on
these heroes of sanctity have always
been preceded by examinations so
minute and scrupulously careful that
the most distrustful critic could not,
without the loss of human confidence,
resist the light of evidence. Look
up above the arches of the grand
nave. There, on a level with the
acanthus leaves of the pilasters, are
the colossal representations and personifications
of the Christian virtues,
mingling like the flora of heaven with
the vegetation of earth. Are there
only mere symbols there? Look a
little lower down, and you will discover
something else. Ranged around
the nave from the choir and the transepts
to the porticoes are the statues of
the founders of the religious orders, beginning
with the patriarch St. Benedict
and ending with St. Vincent de Paul
and St. Theresa; and under the form of
these great leaders, the eye of thought
beholds an innumerable number of
holy souls&mdash;monks or religious&mdash;who,
following their footsteps, have acquired
the palm of sanctity. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
brilliant array of saints around the
basilica does not end at the threshold
of the temple. Go for a moment into
the grand portico, and you will see
the chain continued and prolonged
on the immense colonnade of the
square. There is a whole nation of
martyrs, pontiffs, confessors, and virgins,
ranged like a procession before
the Saviour and his apostles, whose
images look down from the façade
of the basilica. And entering anew
into the nave, you will find on the
pillars of the three first balustrades
at the right and left, the medallions
of the first popes, almost all martyrs;
and this is not a complete list of
those who are honored as saints.
There are more than eighty here who
bear this title; and how many more
are also worthy of being numbered
with them! For, in spite of some
stains that calumny has vainly magnified,
the successors of Peter have
brilliantly justified the title of <i>Holy
See</i> conferred on the Roman chair,
and have left in history the most luminous
train in the annals of sanctity.
You see also the fine mosaics
on the projecting arches of the small
domes&mdash;they are the doctors and the
fathers of the church; and among
them you will find these grand oriental
figures: St. Flavian, St. Germanus
of Constantinople, and St. John
Damascene. Beneath the altars of
the lateral chapels you will discover
the bodies of these other incomparable
glories of the ancient oriental
church: St. Basil the Great, St. Gregory
of Nazianzen, and St. John
Chrysostom. The whole church is
in a manner paved with the tombs
of the saints.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
Do not forget that
this is the place where Nero, the
greatest of persecutors, had the Christians
of Rome burned as torches before
his atrocious eyes. Add to all
these venerable relics, the numberless
others that St. Peter's possesses
in its treasury, without mentioning a
second time the ashes of the holy
apostles, and your faith will behold a
thousand times more beauty and brilliancy
in the august remains that
adorn this grand basilica than in one
of its great illuminations, though the
finest in the world.</p>

<p>And what would we find if we
could examine all the other sanctuaries
of Rome and its immense cemeteries?
The catacombs alone have
furnished for the veneration of the
faithful an incalculable number of
bones of martyrs, and the richness
of these mines, so fruitful in sanctity,
has not yet been exhausted. Different
circumstances have contributed
to bring together at Rome relics from
the entire Christian world. The
most humble oratories and chapels
display such treasures without number.
"One would say that from almost
every region where the gospel
has been preached&mdash;from the mountains
of Armenia to the forests of
America, from the shores of England
to the caves of Japan&mdash;the most of
those who were martyrs by the shedding
of their blood, or martyrs of
charity, have been desirous that some
part of themselves should join this
great council of catacombs. The
ancient Christians sometimes designated
the cemeteries of the martyrs
by the name of councils." A list has
been drawn up of the countries and
cities which were the birthplace, the
residence, or the tombs of the saints
whose relics are at Rome. This geographical
selection is in a manner a
funereal atlas of the Christian world....
What constellations of tombs
are here! An antiquary has happily
said they form <i>the subterranean heaven</i>
of Rome.... If you connect in
imagination with the different parts of
this reliquary of the universe the virtues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
that each specially represents,
and which altogether afford the least
imperfect likeness of the God-man,
you will see in the midst of this
<i>campo santo</i> of the Christian world
the most sublime image of the Saviour
that can be found on earth; for it is
not produced by colors, or composed
of pieces of marble, but of the members
of those who lived the life of
Jesus Christ&mdash;a kind of mosaic doubly
sacred by reason of what it represents
and the materials of which it is composed,
in which each part contributes
to reproduce more grandly the image
with which it is itself stamped. Every
Christian era has contributed to this
work, and Rome is the sepulchre
where this mysterious form will repose
till the last day.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>...</p>

<p>This is not all. Relics much more
sacred than those of the saints are
also reunited in this great metropolis.
Pious pilgrims may venerate considerable
fragments of the wood of
the manger and of the true cross, as
well as the inscription in three languages
that Pilate attached to it.
They can climb the staircase of the
pretorium which the Saviour must
have ascended and descended several
times, and on which may be still seen
traces of his blood. Finally, (for I
cannot tell all,) from the tribune of
the Vatican basilica there is exposed,
on certain solemn occasions, the holy
face imprinted on the veil of Veronica,
a part of the true cross, and the
lance that pierced the heart of Jesus
after his death. What was most
precious at Jerusalem providence has
transferred to Rome, to show that it
is henceforth a new Jerusalem&mdash;the
holy city and the treasury of the
merits of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>This accumulation of relics and
sacred memorials gives to Rome a
peculiar power of profoundly moving
every Christian heart. It is well
known that it is particularly in thus
holy city that are wrought the wonders
of divine grace&mdash;the most extraordinary
conversions. When one has
a soul reasonable and noble enough
to rise above prejudice and common
views, when one is capable of tasting
the gift of God, it is impossible not
to feel the sweet influence of this atmosphere
all impregnated with supernatural
odors. All the religious
monuments, all the sanctuaries, every
atom of dust, so to speak, of this soil
impregnated with the blood of martyrs,
cause in the worthy heart, an
emotion more penetrating and powerful
than any other on earth. And
whatever frivolity or hatred&mdash;too often
agreed&mdash;may say, these impressions
are not weakened by observing
the Roman people in general, or the
majority of the pilgrims to the Holy
City, or its adopted children; on the
contrary, the sight of the crowds
kneeling on the pavements of the
churches or proceeding with grave
thoughtfulness to the stations and religious
festivals, has its share in affecting
the very fibres of each Christian
heart. All this I know does not
move those who quench the light,
according to the expression of
Holy Writ: these can, if they
choose, repeat the insolent proverb,
<i>Roma veduta, fede perduta</i>&mdash;"To see
Rome is to lose your faith;" and,
after all, they are right; for when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
eyes are diseased, nothing blinds them
more easily than the rays of the sun.</p>

<p>Is there any need of adding that
in this respect the Roman Church
defies all comparison with schismatical
or Protestant churches, wherever
they may be? I confine myself to
one question: where is the city in
England, Germany, or Russia that,
after attracting to it the noblest and
most sincere souls in the world, imposes
on them the irresistible desire
of abjuring the religion of their fathers,
as illustrious Protestants have
often done at Rome? This strange
phenomenon, this power of converting,
peculiar to Rome, and to Rome
alone, suffices to prove to those who
can reason from cause to effect that
the Roman Church is truly a holy
and sanctifying church, as it is a
church indivisible, catholic, and
apostolic&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">unam, sanctam, catholicam,
et apostolicam ecclesiam</i>.</p>

<p>All these privileges, these characteristic
signs of the true church are
found, as we have seen, in the basilica
of St. Peter. It is more than certain
that no premeditated intention
has produced this lapidary and monumental
synthesis. All has been
brought about in a spontaneous manner&mdash;effected
only by a sense of the
truth here set forth, and whose inspirations
have been followed. The
Vatican basilica has become an immense
book, which shows on every
leaf the authentic proofs and characteristics
assigned by Christian antiquity
as the means of recognizing
the true institution founded by Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p>It seems to me there is no need
of prolonging these observations to
show the correspondence I mentioned
at first, between this basilica and
the solemn reunion which is soon to
take place under its arches.</p>

<p>When the Council of the Vatican
holds there its grand sessions, the very
stones of the edifice will cry aloud,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lapides clamabunt</i>, to attest that the
church is indivisible&mdash;one in its faith,
its government, its sacraments and
worship, and united in all these by
the unity of its priesthood to its central
authority. The stones of the basilica
will proclaim by their inscriptions,
their statues, and all the sacred
mementoes of which they are the
witnesses and depositories, that this is
the church alone Catholic, the only
origin and source of Catholicity;
alone holy, the only mother of the
saints, and the only source of sanctity.
They will unite their voice to
that of the monuments and tombs in
declaring that this is the church
alone apostolic&mdash;the only inheritor
of the see and privileges of Peter,
and, consequently, the only foundation
of all other churches.</p>

<p>The Vatican basilica possesses a
particular memorial which I have not
yet mentioned, and which is a material
proof of the legitimate succession
of Peter in the Roman Church. It
is the chair once used by the Prince
of the Apostles. This incomparable
relic was exposed to the veneration
of the faithful at the eighteenth centenary
of the martyrdom of St. Peter.
Since that day it has been religiously
enclosed in the walls of the basilica;
but if it is no longer visible to the
eye, there is, at the end of the apsis,
a symbolical representation which
eloquently expresses the same idea.
It is the apostolic chair supported by
the four great doctors of the East and
West, St. Augustine and St. Ambrose,
St. Athanasius and St. John Chrysostom.
In conferring on them the
glory of supporting the chair of Peter
the genius of art has only expressed
the constant language of their deeds
and their writings, condensed in an
expression of St. Augustine, "The primacy
of the apostolic see has always
been confined to the Church of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
Rome." A similar testimony in favor
of the Roman primacy has been
given by other doctors and founders
of churches whose forms adorn the
basilica, or whose bodies repose under
its altars. They all proclaim
the rights of the apostolic see in
union with St. Jerome, "It is on
this rock that the church was founded;
whoever eats of the lamb out of
this house is defiled." They all proclaim
with St. Irenæus that "all
churches ought to rally around that
of Rome on account of its preponderating
preëminence," as the smaller
domes of the basilica surround the
great dome to render homage to its
royal dignity, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">propter potiorem principalitatem</i>.
Finally, the same testimony
is rendered to the supremacy of
St. Peter's chair by the immense
"council of catacombs," by all the
saints whose relics repose in this
<i>campo santo</i>, this "holy field" of the
Christian world. Their remains are
the glory of the Roman communion
in which they professed to live and
die, and, all dead as they are, they
speak and prophesy that this church
will be till the end the true tabernacle
of God with man.</p>

<p>Thus, when Pius IX. takes his
seat to preside at the august council,
he will be surrounded by all
the proofs that assert the plenitude
of his apostolic authority&mdash;the testimony
of the martyrs and holy confessors,
of the doctors and founders
of churches, of the popes his predecessors
and all the traditions they represent;
finally, the testimony of
Jesus Christ himself, whose words the
Vatican basilica expresses in various
ways: "<i>Thou art Peter, and upon this
rock I will build my church....
And I will give to thee the keys of the
kingdom of heaven.... I have
prayed for thee that thy faith fail not....
Feed my sheep. Feed my
lambs.</i>" Surrounded by so many
proofs of his power, of which no
other place in the world can give
a recapitulation more solemnly eloquent,
the successor of Peter can
here claim, with more reason than
anywhere else, the prerogatives of
the Prince of the Apostles; he can
apply to himself the words graven on
the pedestal of the bronze statue of
St. Peter, "Behold in my person the
Divine Word, the rock beautifully
wrought with gold, upon which I
now stand immovable."</p>

<p>The bishops also will find in the
basilica more monuments than in any
other place in the world that attest
the divine right they have received to
govern the church with the successor
of St. Peter, and under his supreme
authority. The expressive statues
of Athanasius, Ambrose, Augustine,
Flavian, and Germanus of Constantinople,
the bodies of Basil the Great,
Gregory of Nazianzen, and Chrysostom
will be there to proclaim the
glory, the privileges, and the inalienable
rights of the episcopacy. But
especially the united relics of the
apostolic college of whom the bishops
are collectively the successors,
the constant presence of this "council
of Jerusalem" will be a proof that
it belongs to them to judge in all
matters of faith and discipline, and to
appropriate the august formula, "It
hath seemed good to the Holy Ghost
and to us"&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Visum est Spiritui Sancto
et nobis</i>.</p>

<p>The Son of God himself will give
to the council of the Vatican very
special pledges of his protection and
love. I have already mentioned the
precious relics of the Passion, the imprint
of the divine face, his cross
which redeemed the world, and the
lance that brought forth blood and
water from his heart&mdash;symbols of
baptism and all the treasures of grace.
The Catholic faith has the assurance
of the divine assistance promised to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
&oelig;cumenical councils. It cannot receive
from the presence of these venerable
objects any substantial augmentation;
but they may produce a
sensible excitation, and will be a very
special pledge of reasonable hope;
and besides, if it is true that certain
privileged places have the power of
profoundly moving the soul, how can
it be denied that this virtue evidently
belongs to the basilica of St. Peter?
Yes, it is right that the greatest event
of our age should take place in this
temple&mdash;the largest in the world&mdash;under
these arches which astonish us
the more the longer we regard them,
because they give us an ever new
sensation of immensity and majesty.
It is right that the representatives of
the universal church should be face
to face with the immortal monuments
of apostolicity, unity, catholicity, and
sanctity; in presence of these tombs
of the sovereign pontiffs and great
bishops; in contact, so to speak, with
the corner-stone on which whoever
falls shall be broken. It is right that
in looking down into the glorious
tombs of Sts. Peter and Paul they
should behold the very origin of
Christianity; and this at a time when
there is a question of the renovation
and modification of Christian society.
Finally, it is right that, in laboring upon
this superhuman work, they should
have before them the eloquent examples
of their glorious predecessors
in the same work, and likewise
the visible signs and authentic proofs
of the assistance, protection, and
blessing of Heaven. All these mementoes
and holy objects will inspire
the fathers of the council with a more
profound sentiment of the greatness
of their task and a deeper consciousness
of their strength; and when they
behold on the dome the representation
of the Father of light, from whom
cometh every perfect gift, that of the
eternal Shepherd surrounded by his
apostles and the Queen of saints, and
that of the Spirit of truth hovering
over the tomb of St. Peter and over
his symbolic chair, they will feel more
fully that they are not vain representations;
they will hear and comprehend
with a more profound and intense
emotion the words of the divine
promises, <i>Behold I am with you....
As the Father hath sent me, so have I
sent you.... I will send you the
Paraclete, who shall teach you all truth....
He who heareth you heareth
me: he who despiseth you despiseth
me. He who believeth shall be saved:
he who believeth not shall be condemned.</i></p>

<p>I have endeavored to present some
of the reflections suggested by the
Vatican basilica by reason of the coming
council. From the same point of
view we might find many other perspectives
not less interesting, by taking
new positions near the tombs of
the holy apostles.</p>

<p>For the present, however, it is time
to close. Let us leave these sacred
walls after having kissed anew the revered
foot of Peter. In traversing the
great square, let us read the celebrated
inscription graven by Sixtus V. on
the obelisk, and which, it is to be
hoped, will have, by means of the
council, its entire verification, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Christus
vincit&mdash;Christus regnat&mdash;Christus
imperat. Christus ab omni malo plebem
suam defendat</i>. "Christ overcomes&mdash;Christ
reigns&mdash;Christ rules.
May Christ defend his people from
every evil."</p>

<p>And now, before separating, let us
ascend for a moment one of the hills
of Rome to contemplate this great
basilica from a distance, at the hour
preferred by visitors, when the sun is
about to set behind the dome. Here
listen to the lines of a poet whose
name is dear to us by so many titles:</p>

<p>Yes, Silvio Pellico is right: there
are before us two of the finest creations
in the universe. The light that
God has suspended in the firmament
to shine on man, and this temple
that man has erected to honor his
God. But if the divine basilica of
Peter appears so beautiful and radiant
when the sun surrounds it with
an aureola of rubies and sapphires,
what will it be when the look of faith,
which discovers things invisible, sees
it surrounded by the rays, a thousand
times more brilliant, of divine and incorruptible
truth? Such, nevertheless,
will be the spectacle Catholic
souls will enjoy when is accomplished
what the bishops in a celebrated address
have styled the great work of
light&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">grande opus illuminationis</i>.</p>

<h2>BEECHER'S NORWOOD.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>[Our delay in noticing this book by a
distinguished author till the reading public
have probably forgotten it, has been purely
unintentional. We placed it, soon after its
publication, in the hands of one of our collaborateurs,
a genuine New Englander by
birth, education, and association, to prepare
a notice or a review of it, as he might judge
proper. He read it, no inconsiderable feat,
but was taken very ill, and lay for many
months with faint hopes of recovery. During
his illness and for some time after his
recovery the book was forgotten. He now,
at this late day, sends us his judgment, and
we hasten to pay our respects to the author,
and our debt to the publishers.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed. Cath.
World.</span>]</p></blockquote>


<p>The Beecher family is certainly a
remarkably gifted family, though we
think the father, Dr. Lyman Beecher,
was the best of them all. Yet his two
daughters, Miss Catharine Beecher and
Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe, are women
of rare abilities, and have made
their mark on the times and sad havoc
with New England theology. Dr.
Edward Beecher has written several
notable books, among which
may be mentioned <i>The Papal Conspiracy</i>
and the <i>Conflict of the Ages</i>,
which prove him almost equally hostile
to Rome and to Geneva. Henry
Ward Beecher is the most distinguished
of the sons, and probably
ranks as the most popular, certainly
the most striking, pulpit orator in the
country. But none of the family are
remarkable for purity of taste, refined
culture, or classical grace and
polish as writers. They would seem
to owe their success partly to their
audacity, but principally to a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
rough vigor and energy of character,
and to their sympathy with the popular
tendencies of their country. They
rarely take, never knowingly take, the
unpopular side of a question, or attempt
to stem the current of popular
opinion. They are of the world,
and the world loves them. They
never disturb its conscience by condemning
its moral ideal, or calling
upon it to strive after a higher and
purer ideal. They have in an eminent
degree the genius of commonplace.
There are in <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> and
<i>The Ministers Wooing</i> passages of rare
force and vigor, but they are not
very original, nor very recondite.
The Beecher genius is not lyrical or
dramatic, but essentially militant and
prosaic. It can display itself only
against an antagonist, and an antagonist
at least about to fall under the
ban of public opinion. They have
some imitative ability, but little creative
power, and rarely present us with
a living character. We remember only
two living characters in all Mrs.
Stowe's writings, Dred and the Widow
Scudder; and we are not certain
that these are not copies of originals.</p>

<p>The author of <i>Norwood</i> is less of
an artist than his sister, Mrs. Stowe,
and under the relation of art his
novel is below criticism. It contains
many just observations on various
topics, but by no means original or
profound; it seizes some few of the
traits of New England village life;
but its characters, with the exception
of Judge Bacon, Agate Bissell, and
Hiram Beers, are the abstractions
or impersonations of the author's
theories. The author has little dramatic
power, and not much wit or
humor. The persons or personages
of his book are only so many points
in the argument which he is carrying
on against Calvinistic orthodoxy for
pure naturalism. The substance of
his volume seems to be made up of
the fag-ends of his sermons and lectures.
He preaches and lectures all
through it, and rather prosily into the
bargain. His Dr. Wentworth is a
bore, and his daughter Rose, the heroine
of the story, is a species of
bluestocking, and neither lovely
nor lovable. As a type of the New
England cultivated and accomplished
lady she is a failure, and is hardly
up to the level of the New England
school-ma'am. The sensational incidents
of the story are old and worn
out, and the speculations on love
indicate very little depth of feeling or
knowledge of life, or of the human
heart. The author proceeds on a
theory, and so far shows his New
England birth and breeding, but he
seldom touches reality.</p>

<p>As a picture of New England village
life it is singularly unfortunate,
and still more so as a picture of village
life in the valley of the Connecticut,
some twenty miles above Springfield,
in Massachusetts, where the scene is
laid, and where the tone and manners
of society in a village of five
thousand inhabitants, the number
Norwood is said to contain, hardly
differ in refinement and polish from
the tone and manners of the better
classes in Boston and its vicinity.
There are no better families,
better educated, better bred, more
intellectual in the State, than are
to be found in no stinted numbers
in the towns of the Connecticut valley,
the garden of Massachusetts.
The book is full of anachronisms.
The peculiar New England traits
given existed to a certain extent, in
our boyhood, in back settlements or
towns not lying near any of the great
thoroughfares; but they have very
generally disappeared through the influence
of education, the railroads,
which run in all directions through
the State, and the almost constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
intercourse with the society of the
capital.</p>

<p>The turnpikes did much to destroy
the rustic manners and language of
the population of the interior villages,
and the railroads have completed
what they left undone. Save in
a few localities, there is no longer a
rustic population in Massachusetts,
and very little distinction between
the countryman and the citizen. In
small country villages you may find
Hiram Beers still, but Tommy Taft,
Polly Marble, and Agate Bissell are
of a past generation, and even in the
past belonged to Connecticut rather
than to the Old Bay State. Strangers
suppose the people of the several
New England States have all the
same characteristics, and are cut out
and made up after the same pattern;
but in reality, except in the valley of
the Connecticut, where there is a
blending of the characteristics of the
adjoining States, the differences between
the people of one State and
those of another are so strongly
marked that a careful observer can
easily tell, on seeing a stranger, to
which of the six New England States
he belongs, without hearing him speak
a word, and not unfrequently the section
of his State from which he
comes. There is no mistaking a
Berkshire countryman for a Cape
Codder, or a Vermonter for a true
son of the Old Bay State, or a Rhode
Islander. The gait, the air, the
manners, the physiognomy even, tell
at once the man's native State. The
Vermonter is the Kentuckian of the
East, as the Georgian is the Yankee
of the South, and we have found no
two cities in the Union, and there are
few east of the Rocky Mountains
that we have not visited, where the
citizens of the one have so many
points of resemblance with those of
the other, as Boston, the metropolis
of New England, and Charleston, the
real capital of South Carolina. Accidental
differences of course there
are, but the type of character is the
same, and the purest and best American
type we have met with. And
we are very disinterested in our judgment,
for we are natives of neither
city nor State. In both we have the
true English type with its proper
American modifications. No two cities
stood firmer, shoulder to shoulder,
during the American war of independence,
"the times that tried men's
souls," than Boston and Charleston.
They became opposed not till, under
the lead of Philadelphia and the
Pennsylvania and Kentucky politicians,
Congress had fastened on the
country the so-called American system,
which struck a severe blow at
the commerce of New England, and
compelled its capitalists to seek investment
for their capital in manufactures.
It is a little singular that
New England, which up to 1842 had
voted against every protective tariff
that had been adopted, should have
the credit or discredit of originating
and securing the adoption of the protective
system. The ablest speech
ever made against the system in Congress
was made in 1824 by Mr.
Webster, then a member of the House
of Representatives from Boston. We
express no opinion on the question
between free-trade and so-called protection;
we only say that Pennsylvania
and Kentucky, not the New England
States, are chiefly responsible
for the protective system; the very remote
cause, at least, of the late terrible
civil war between the North and
South, in which, if the victory was
for the Union, the South are likely to
be the gainers in the long run, and
the North the losers.</p>

<p>But we are wandering. Mr. Beecher
speaks truly of the diversity and
originality of individual character in
New England, which you discover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
when you have once broken through
the thin crust of conventionalism;
but he seems not to have observed
equally the marked differences of character
between the people of the several
States. The wit of a Massachusetts
man is classical and refined;
of the Connecticut man sly, and not
incapable of being coarse; of the
Vermonter it is broad farce, and nobody
better than he can keep a company
of good fellows in a roar till
morning. The Bay State man has a
strong attachment to tradition and to
old manners and customs, and his
innovating tendency is superinduced,
and is as repugnant to his nature as
Protestantism is to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">perfervidum ingenium
Scottorum</i>. He is naturally a
conservative, as the Scotch are, if
we may so speak, naturally Catholic;
and it was only a terrible wrench of
the Scottish nature that induced the
loyal Scots to adopt the Reformation.
The Connecticut man excels the
Bay State man in ingenuity, in inventive
genius, in doing much with little;
is less conservative by nature,
and more enterprising and adventurous,
and in his exterior conduct more
under the influence of public opinion.
Each is proud of his State, and the
Connecticut man especially, who has
acquired wealth elsewhere, is fond of
returning to his early home to display
it; but attachment to the soil is not
very strong in either, and neither will
make heavy sacrifices for simple love
of country. The Bay State man is
more influenced by his principles, his
convictions, like the South Carolinian,
and the Connecticut man more by
his interests.</p>

<p>The Vermonter has no conservative
tendency by nature; he cares not the
snap of his finger for what his father
believed or did; is personally independent,
generally free from snobbishness,
no slave to public opinion, and
for the most part has the courage of
his convictions; but he loves his State,
loves her green hills and fertile valleys,
and when abroad holds a fellow-Vermonter
dear as his brother. A
Georgian and a Connecticut man are
fighting in Georgia; the Connecticut
man looking on will wish his countryman
to get the better of his Georgian
opponent, but will not interpose
till he has inquired into the cause of
the dispute, and ascertained on which
side is the law. A Georgian and a
Vermonter are fighting under the same
circumstances; the Vermonter comes
up, looks, knocks the Georgian down,
rescues his countryman, and investigates
the cause and the law afterward.
The Vermonter pays no attention
to the personal responsibility
he may incur; the Connecticut man
tries to keep always clear of the law;
and if he makes up his mind to do a
great wrong to some one, he takes
care to do it under cover of law, so
that no hold can be got of him. The
Bay State man is much the same;
and the Connecticut man has less of
patriotism than the Vermonter. We
speak of what was the case in our
own youth and early manhood; yet
the character of the whole American
people has so changed during the
last forty years that we can hardly
any longer recognize them, and in
the judgment of an old man they
have changed not for the better.</p>

<p>We have no space to remark on
the characteristic differences of the
three remaining New England States.
These States have still less resemblance
to each other. The people
of Maine differ widely from the people
of New Hampshire, and the people
of Rhode Island have very few
traits in common with the people of
any of the other New England States.
The author of <i>Norwood</i> has lost no
little of his own original New England
character or overlaid it with his
Westernism. He is not in sympathy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
with the true New England character,
as found in any of the New
England States, and is more disposed
to exaggerate, in his descriptions, its
few eccentricities than to bring out
its higher and nobler qualities. No
doubt the Puritan settlers of Massachusetts
and Connecticut set out
with the intention of founding what
they regarded as a Christian commonwealth,
in which the evangelical
counsels should be recognized and
enforced as laws. They would have
organized and maintained society,
except in not enjoining celibacy, after
the mode of a Catholic monastery.
They attempted by constant vigilance
and the strict enforcement of very
rigorous laws to shut out all vice and
immorality from their community.
They were rigorists in morals, somewhat
rigid and stern in their personal
character, and have been generally
supposed to be much more so than
they really were. Their experiment
of a Christian commonwealth as it
existed in their own ideal failed, partly
through their defective faith and
the absence of supernatural grace,
and partly through their exacting too
much of human nature, or even of
men in the flesh, except an elect
few. But they, nevertheless, succeeded
in laying the foundation of
a Christian as distinguished from a
pagan republic, or in founding the
state, the first in history, on truly
Christian principles; that is, on the
rights of God, and which better than
any other known state has protected
the rights of man.</p>

<p>The Puritan did not separate from
the Church of England on the principle
of liberty of dissent, or because
he wished to establish what liberals
now understand by religious liberty.
The principle of his separation was
the Catholic principle, that the magistrate
has no authority in spirituals,
and no right to prescribe any
forms or ceremonies to be used in
worship. It was a solemn protest
not against the doctrines of the Anglican
Church, but against the authority
it conceded in spiritual matters
to the civil power&mdash;or the civil
magistrate, as they said then. The
Puritan was logical; he had a good
major, and his conclusion would have
been just, if his minor had only been
true; and we are, in our opinion, indebted
to him far more than to Lord
Baltimore or to Governor Dongan
of New York for the freedom of conscience
secured by our institutions.
Lord Baltimore and Governor Dongan
sought the free exercise of
their own religion for their co-religionists,
and asserted, and in their
situation could assert, only toleration.
Neither could assert the principle of
true religious liberty, the incompetency
of the state in spirituals, holding,
as they did, their power from the
king of England and head of the
Anglican Church. The Puritan
abominated toleration, called it the
devil's doctrine, and proved himself
little disposed to practise it; but in
asserting the absolute independence
of the church or religion before the
civil magistrate, he asserted the true
principle of religious liberty, which
the Catholic Church always and
everywhere asserts, and laid in the
American mind the foundation of
that religious freedom of which our
religion, which they hated, now enjoys
the benefit.</p>

<p>We have nothing to say of the virtues
of the Puritans in relation to the
world to come; but they certainly
had great and rare civil virtues, and
they have had the leading share in
founding and shaping the American
state. They were grave, earnest&mdash;too
much so, if you will; but however
short they fell in practice, they always
asserted the independence and
supremacy of the moral order in relation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
to civil government, and the obligation
of every man to obey God
rather than men, and to live always
in reference to the end for which
God makes him. Their moral standard
was high, and they set an example
of as moral a people as can be
looked for outside of the church.
They had only a faulty religion, and
perhaps were Stoics rather than Christians
in their temper; but they always
put religion in its right place,
and gave the precedence to its ministers.
They placed education under
charge of the church, and the system
of common schools which they originated
or adopted was really a system
of parochial schools, under the
supervision of the pastor, and supported
by a tax on the parish, imposed
by the parishioners, in public
meetings, on themselves. The centralized
system of godless schools,
borrowed from the Convention that
decreed the death of Louis XVI.,
generally adopted by the Middle and
Western States, is hardly yet fully
adopted in Massachusetts, though
since 1835 it has been gradually gaining
the ascendency; and Cambridge
University, founded for God and the
church, has only this very year thrown
off its religious character, dispensed
with morning prayers,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
and become a
purely secular institution&mdash;an inevitable
but a lamentable change.</p>

<p>The Puritans not only adopted a
high moral standard, but they lived
as nearly up to it as is possible for
human nature alone since the fall,
and few examples of a more rigidly
moral people can be found than were
the New England people for a century
and a half after the landing of the
Pilgrims, and to them, in no small
measure, the whole Union is indebted
for its moral character as well as for
the greater part of its higher institutions
of learning. There have been
as learned, as gifted, as great men,
found in other States, and perhaps
even more learned, gifted, and greater;
but there is no part of the Union
where the intellectual tone of society
is so high, or intellectual culture so
general as in New England, especially
in the States founded by the Puritans,
as were Massachusetts and Connecticut.
New York leads in trade
and commerce; Pennsylvania latterly,
Virginia formerly, in politics; but the
New England mind has led in law,
jurisprudence, literature, art, science,
and philosophy; though since Puritanism
has been lapsing into liberalism
its preëminence is passing
away. We speak of New England
as it was thirty or forty years ago, or
a little earlier, when the majority of
the supreme judges, and two thirds
of the members of the legislature
of New York were Connecticut or,
at least, New England men. New
England, we fear, is no longer what
she was when we were young, and
she appears only the shadow of her
former self. She is attempting to do,
from sheer calculation, and purely
secular motives, what even in the
heyday of Puritanism was more than
she could effect, aided by strong religious
convictions and motives. Still,
if the substance is wanting, she keeps
up the appearance of her old moral
character, and in no part of the
Union will you hear finer moral sentences,
or better reasoned orations on
the beauty of virtue and the necessity
of religion to the commonwealth.
Even New England infidelity is
obliged to assume a moral garb, to
express itself in Christian phrases,
and affect to be more Christian than
Christianity itself.</p>

<p>The author of <i>Norwood</i> does not
do justice to the intellectual character
of New England life, to the thought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
the reflection, and movements of a
New England village of five thousand
inhabitants. His village philosopher,
Dr. Wentworth, is very shallow, being
very narrow and very prosy. We
could easily find any number of farmers
in the valley of the Connecticut
able to see through his paganism at a
glance, and refute it with a word.
Especially is the author unjust to
New England women. No doubt such
women as Polly Marble, Rachel Cathcart,
Agate Bissell, and Mother Taft
can be found in a New England village,
but they are not representative
characters. New England Puritanism
was never so stiff, or so annoying
to one's self or to others, as it appears
in these exceptional characters. The
women of New England are in general
remarkable for their intellectual
culture, their gentleness, their refinement,
their grace and dignity of manners,
the elevation and breadth of
their minds, and the extent and variety
of their information, no less than
for their domestic tastes and habits,
or superior <i>faculty</i> as housekeepers.
There are, no doubt, blue stockings
in Yankeeland which their wearers'
skirts are too short to conceal; no
doubt, also, there are women there
who encroach on the rights and prerogatives
of the other sex, and aspire
to be men; but your leading woman's
rights women and men are not
New Englanders. Our old friend,
Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, is a
New Yorker, and Susan B. Anthony,
if born in Nantucket, is a Quakeress,
and the Quakers are of no country, or
simply are their own country.</p>

<p>Many movements are accredited to
New England which originated elsewhere,
and are simply taken up by a
certain class of New Englanders in
easy circumstances, as a diversion or
a dissipation, instead of whist, balls,
routs, and plays. Yet they are only
a class. The Massachusetts legislature
voted down, by a large majority,
the proposition to give the elective
franchise to women, and the legislation
of the Old Bay State continues
far more masculine and conservative
than that of the State of New York.</p>

<p><i>Norwood</i> leaves the impression on
the reader that the Puritans were a
set of gloomy fanatics, austere and
unbending, harsh and cruel, minding
every body's business but their own,
and seeking, in season and out of season,
to cram their horrible doctrines
down every neighbor's throat, and
that the only sociable and agreeable
people to be found among them were
precisely those who had broken away
from the Puritan thraldom, and returned
to the cultivation and worship
of nature. The wish is father to the
thought. More social, neighborly, genial,
kind-hearted, hospitable people
it would be difficult to find in the
Union than were the great body of
these New England Puritans, than
perhaps they are still; though they
have by no means improved since
they have abolished the dinner-table,
as they suppose in the interest of
temperance, and substituted opium
for Santa Cruz rum and old Jamaica
spirits, as they have philanthropy for
devotion. Intellect, morals, and sociality
seem to us to have sadly deteriorated
under the misdirected efforts
to advance them.</p>

<p>But Henry Ward Beecher has had
a far other purpose in <i>Norwood</i> than
to produce a work of art, to construct
a story, or to sketch New England
village life. He is willing
enough to correct some of the misapprehensions
which Southerners have,
or had, of New England character;
but his book, after all, has a serious
purpose, and is intended to be a
death-blow to New England theological
and moral doctrines.</p>

<p>The author, though nominally a
Christian, and professedly a Congregational<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
preacher, is really a pagan,
and wishes to abolish Puritanism for
the worship of nature. But it is less
the Puritan than the Christian he
wars against; and if he understands
himself, which is doubtful, his thought
is, that a child, taken as born, without
baptism or regeneration, may be
trained up by the influence of flowers
and close communion with nature,
beasts, birds, and fishes, reptiles and
insects, to be a Christian of the first
water. Dr. Wentworth represents
this theory, and reduces it to practice
in the training of his daughter Rose,
whose chief educator is the half-idiot
negro, Pete, "no great things in the
intellects, but with a heart as big as
that of an ox." The theory recognizes
Christ only in nature, and really
identifies him with nature, and resolves
the Christian law of perfection
into the natural laws of the physicists.
The author holds, if any thing,
that heaven, the crown of life, is in
the order of generation, and is attainable
as the result of natural development.</p>

<p>The theory, of course, rejects the
very fundamental principle of Christianity,
which declares that "except a
man be born again he cannot see the
kingdom of God." The author, indeed,
does not deny in words the new birth;
nay, asserts it, but resolves it into a
natural operation, a sort of mental
and physical crisis, and recognizes nothing
supernatural, or any infusion of
grace in it; which is in reality to deny
it. We have as hearty a dislike of Calvinism
as any one can have, and we
know it passably well by our own early
experience; but we confess that we
have no wish to see old-fashioned
Puritanism exchanged for pure rationalism
or mere naturalism, and as
against Henry Ward Beecher, we are
strongly tempted to defend it. Any
one who knows New England at all,
knows that its morals have deteriorated
just in proportion as its old
Puritanism has declined, or been
liberalized. The fact, whatever the
explanation, is undeniable. In our
judgment, it is the natural result of
loosening the restraints which Puritanism
undoubtedly imposed on the
passions and conduct, and leaving
people to their natural passions, instincts,
and propensities, without any
restraint at all. Despotism is bad
enough; but it is better than no government,
better than anarchy. As it
affects the question of conversion to
the church, we see no gain in the
change. We think a sincere, earnest-minded
Puritan a less hopeless subject
than a liberal, like an Emerson,
a John Weis, a John Stuart Mill, a Mr.
Lecky, a Herbert Spencer, or such
men as were the late Mr. Buckle
and the late Sir William Hamilton,
who despise Christianity too much to
offer any direct opposition to it. The
honest Puritan is prejudiced indeed,
and unwilling to hear a word in
favor of the church; yet he believes
in Christian morals, and has some
conception of the Christian plan of
salvation, and therefore really something
for the missionary to work on;
but men who have resolved Christianity
into naturalism, and measure
reality or even the knowable by their
own narrow and superficial understandings,
are beyond his reach.
Their case is hopeless.</p>

<p>Puritanism keeps alive in the community
a certain Christian habit of
thought, a belief in the necessity
of grace, and more or less of a Christian
conscience. The greater part
of the common people gathered into
the sects in seasons of revivals, if
our missionaries were present, could
just as easily be gathered into the
church, and be saved. We suffer
terribly in this country for the want
of missionary priests, who can go
wherever their services are needed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
by those who know not yet "the
faith once delivered to the saints."
Our priests are too few for the wants
even of our old Catholic population,
and what with hearing confessions,
and attending sick calls, building
churches and school-houses, and providing
for the most pressing wants of
a Catholic people, are over-worked,
and soon exhausted. The great majority
of our priests die young, from
excessive labor. There is with us a
vast missionary field, not indeed
among the sects, but among the so-called
Nothingarians, who comprise
the majority of the American people,
and who, though without any specific
belief, are yet far from being confirmed
unbelievers. But let the
Beechers and their associates succeed
in reducing Christianity to naturalism,
and you soon make this whole class
downright infidels. We can have,
therefore, no sympathy with Beecherism,
or pleasure in seeing its success
against even old-fashioned New England
Puritanism.</p>

<p>We should say as much of the
Presbyterianism of the Middle, Western,
and Southern States. We believe
any of the older Protestant sects that
retain a belief in the Trinity, the Incarnation,
and future rewards and punishments,
and that practise infant baptism,
are preferable by far to any form
of modern liberalism, which discards
dogma for sentiment and reason for
the soul, and are really nature-worshippers,
and as much idolaters as were the
old pagans, whose rivers and ponds,
whose gardens and orchards were overrun
with gods. Even a Methodist is
upon the whole better than a Liberal,
however puffed up he may be by the
successful worship of mammon by
his sect, and its growing respectability
in the eyes of the world.</p>

<p>We have bestowed, perhaps, more
attention on Mr. Beecher and his novel
than they deserve, but we have
made them the text for a desultory
discourse, partly in defence of New
England against her denigration attempted
by one of her prominent sons,
and partly in protest against the revival
of heathen nature-worship
favored by the author. We have
not aimed at exalting New England
above other sections of the Union.
Each section of our common country
has its peculiar merits, which are
essential to the welfare and development
of the whole. New England
has hers, which, in some respects, excel
those of other sections, and in
other respects fall short of them. It
is not for us to strike the balance,
and to decide which upon the whole
preponderate. We have wished to
give New England her due, without
detracting any thing from what is
due to any other section of the Union.
We should be sorry to see the effort
now making to New Englandize the
South succeed. There are some
things in the New England character
that could be corrected with
advantage; and there is much in the
Southern character, its openness, its
frankness, its personal independence,
its manliness, its aristocratic tone and
manner, that we should be sorry to
lose. But we do not like to find any
man decrying his own native land
or insensible to its merits.</p>

<h2>CHURCH MUSIC<br />

I.</h2>


<p>"The Prayer of the Church is the
most pleasing to the ear and heart
of God, and therefore the most
efficacious of all prayers." While
we have been perusing the various
works on church music that have
come before us in the shape of
book, pamphlet, tract, and magazine
article, we could not keep the words
we have quoted above from the celebrated
Dom Gueranger out of our
mind. In Europe, both in England
and on the continent, it is evident,
from the numerous publications pertinent
to the subject which have
been lately issued, that the due celebration
of the divine offices of the
Church is becoming more and more
the object of no little anxiety on the
part of the hierarchy, and that the
clergy are everywhere making strenuous
efforts to get rid of the abuses
which since the Protestant reformation,
the straitness of the times has
tolerated. One of the most notorious
of these abuses, fully naturalized
amongst us, is the profane character
of church music. Several writers,
among whom stand preëminent two
English priests&mdash;the Rev. Canon
Oakeley and the Rev. James Nary&mdash;have
crossed swords on the subject
of reform, and we have thus been
enabled not only to get at the merits
of the particular dispute between these
two amicable combatants, but have
been led as well to reflect upon the primary
object of music in the divine offices,
the intention of the Church, and
the means she has ordained for realizing
it; although we must confess
that, with Dom Gueranger's words
ringing in our ears, we have not
heard from the pages of the publications
in question quite so clear an
echo to their truth as we would have
wished.</p>

<p>The ritual service of the Church is
her prayer, and melody is the almost
universal form of expression employed
in its celebration. Whatever music
is sung or performed at her solemn
rites is supposed to be sung
and performed by her not as a musical
performance, but as a prayer.
These are the points more or less ignored
in all the discussions on what
is or may be made suitable music for
the Church. The different sentences,
anthems, psalms, etc., appointed to
be sung by the choir, are all so
many prayers offered by the Church.
Therefore it is plain that what is
proper as music at her offices must
as a first principle be a worthy expression
of the voice of the Church
lifted in prayer. When the priest,
robed in his garments of sacrifice,
intones the Gloria at the altar, he
does so in the name of the Church,
not as the Rev. Mr. &mdash;&mdash; performing
a short, effective, and fine tenor solo;
and when the choir continues the
same angelical anthem, they do so&mdash;or
rather, are supposed to do so&mdash;as
his assistants in the divine action.
The priest takes his seat to await its
conclusion, not to make one of an
audience who for the time being are
to be relieved from the more engrossing
thoughts of prayer by criticising
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gratias</i> as rendered by Mr. A.,
enjoying the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qui tollis</i> by Miss B., or
the <i>telling</i> chorus of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cum Sancto</i>.</p>

<p>That the musical portions of the
church offices are in a true sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
prayer, and are based upon that idea
alone, namely, the union of the soul
with God; that such is the chief
intention of the Church, and should
be the only object sought in the
choice of music and the execution of
it, to the absolute subserviency, even
if not to the completely ignoring, of
every other sentiment, is therefore beyond
question; but who will not be
able to count upon his ten fingers
the churches in the United States
where the music would be likely to
leave any such impression upon the
minds of the worshippers?</p>

<p>We say this not in any cynical
spirit. We know the "straitness of
the times," and we ourselves have
been straitened, and are still, as
well as our neighbors; but the general
uneasiness and discontent felt
among all classes because of the
wretched performances of sacred music
to which we have been subjected,
utterly at variance as they are with
the spirit of the sublime and solemn
functions of religion, is beginning
to find a voice to make audible
complaint, and exciting some
laudable efforts to rid the holy place
of harmonies which savor more of
the world, the flesh, and the devil
than they do of divine prayer. So
common is the ignorance of what
the true music of the Church is, that
it is a rare thing to find even a Catholic
who has any idea that the
Mass has not yet been fully sung
when he has heard the Kyrie, Gloria,
Credo, Sanctus, and Agnus Dei, and
not a note of the Introit, Gradual,
Prose, Offertory, or Communion.
And as for the Vespers, we think the
fingers of one hand might suffice to
count the churches where any attempt
is made to perform them entire. Of
the compositions executed in every
style of musical art at Mass, will not
the first person to whom you may
address yourself, be he a devout Catholic
well instructed in other matters,
or a music-loving Protestant who is
fond of "attending service" in our
churches on account of the "glorious
music of the Catholic Church,"
which he thinks he hears there&mdash;will
they not both tell you, if you are at
the pains to interrogate them, that
Mozart and Haydn hold the place
of angelic doctors of music in the
Catholic Church, and Webbe, Farmer,
Concone and Co. have equally honorable
titles for small churches and
country choirs?</p>

<p>Would not either of them return
you a stare of incredulity if you told
them that not one composition of
any of these authors has ever been
recognized by any authority in the
Church, and that the singing of them
has, in point of fact, been only barely
tolerated; that the great mass of
these musical <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">morceaux</i> are wholly
unfit for the purpose for which they
were written, and that, ten chances
to one, neither of these good friends
have ever heard, save the chanting
of the priest, one single note of the
music sanctioned by the Church in
all their lives? Yet all this is true
to the very letter. Lamentably true;
for religion, in the grandeur, power,
and spiritual beauty of its sacred offices,
is the loser by it, and the devout
and prayerful spirit which such offices
are calculated to excite in the souls
of the faithful is to a great extent
hindered, and replaced by a spirit
of sensuousness and worldly amusement.</p>

<p>The fact beyond dispute is, that
the faithful are deprived of the true
expression of the divine prayer of
the Church, both on account of the
profane character of the music performed
and the entire omission of
those portions of the Mass and Vespers
which give a distinctive color,
tone, and meaning to the seasons
and festivals, such as the Introit, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
Gradual, Prose, Offertory, Communion,
and Antiphons.</p>

<p>Not to speak of the wholly inexcusable
practice of reproducing well-known
arias from different operas to
which the words of some devout
hymn are adapted in the most shockingly
garbled manner, without regard
to grammar or sense, a cursory examination
of "the masses" popular
among us, and sung, without distinction,
at any season and on any
festival, would be sufficient to condemn
them as totally unfit as vehicles
of expression for the words set to
them, or the occasion of their performance.
Let us quote some true
words from the Rev. Mr. Nary:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Would any one contend that the rollicking
tunes of many a modern Kyrie express
the meaning of the supplicatory ejaculation,
<i>Lord, have mercy on us</i>?... It may fairly
be questioned whether any one unaccustomed
to our florid church-music, upon hearing
one of the jigs which render the sweet prayer,
<i>O Lord, give us peace, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dona nobis pacem</span></i>,
in some of our modern masses, would be
able to tell, not only that it aptly describes
the words, but even that it expresses any
religious feeling at all. That in numerous
instances, modern church music, instead of
being descriptive of the holy words to which
it is joined, rather expresses the sensuous
languor of the stage, or the airy joy of the
ball-room, could not well be disputed.</p>

<p>"Indeed, it is exceedingly remarkable that
what Haydn, Mozart, Weber, and others
would have been ashamed to do for the
stage, they have, seemingly without a qualm
of conscience, done for the house of God.
They knew that they must have been accused
of folly, had they in one of their
operatic works given to earnestness the
tones of jesting, to prayer those of mirth;
but this is precisely what they have done
for the services of the Church. The most
touching supplications of the liturgy are
often clothed by them in strains of mockery....
It is not implied here that there
are not in the works of the great modern
composers beautiful passages full of genuine
religious feeling; but will any impartial
judge contend that there are many masses
in which there is no blundering at all between
the words and the music?...
Nay, is it not true that certain masses by
those composers, if separated from the sacred
words and applied to some libretto of
the late Eugène Scribe, would only gain in
naturalness and meaning by the change?
What, then, it may be asked, is there no
other music for the Almighty than that of
the theatre?... It can hardly be
disputed that some of our own churches
have too often, in their musical efforts, exhibited
scenes bordering very closely upon
downright desecration of the house of God....
There is no need to describe the
sad feelings which arise in the heart of a
Catholic who finds the adorable sacrifice
of the Mass turned into a Sunday morning
amusement.</p>

<p>"Some people, who allow that the music
of some of our churches is thoroughly profane,
still justify its use on the plea that it
allures strangers, who may be favorably impressed
with other and more religious portions
of the service. But this is a poor
justification of practices which annoy the
real congregation, and hinder devotion.
No doubt a priest should seek to draw
strangers to his church, but all means are
not equally legitimate toward attaining
this laudable end. Besides, the writer
though entirely unable to form any judgment
which he could commend to the belief
of others, much doubts whether any priest
could trace more than a few conversions, if
any at all, not to his church music, which
may partly be very ecclesiastical, but to his
florid or orchestral music, as to their origin."</p></blockquote>

<p>We need to add little to this. The
impressions left upon the mind after
being subjected to any one of such
performances is well known to all who
have suffered. What religious feelings
might one reasonably expect to
have pervaded (may we not say the
audience?) or what devotion could
possibly be excited in the hearts of
any unfortunate worshippers present
on the occasion of which the following
is a report:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Haydn's Mass No. 16 was the great selection.
The <i>Kyrie</i> was coldly given, the
alto and bass, in the <i>soli</i> parts, being hardly
strung up to tune. In the <i>Gloria</i>, however,
both chorus and soloists warmed to their
work, and several of the finest choral passages
were given with great power and precision.
The <i>Credo</i> was not taken up firmly,
but every praise is due to the manner in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
which the choir acquitted themselves at the
finish, and in the exquisite <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Et Incarnatus</i>
and succeeding quartette the four principal
voices blended beautifully together, and the
alto (Miss &mdash;&mdash;) told well in the delivery of
the leading and interwoven subject, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sub
Pontio</i>. The most critical would have been
satisfied with the evenness with which the
principal voices were balanced in this and
the subsequent <i>soli</i> passages. The <i>Sanctus</i>
and <i>Hosanna</i> were very fairly given, the <i>Benedictus</i>
being perhaps the most telling effort
of all. The opening of the <i>Agnus</i> was not
delivered sufficiently <i>staccato</i>, as the chorus
did not hang well together. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dona Nobis</i>
made up for all, and throughout the
principals acquitted themselves in unexceptionable
style, being well supported at the
finish by the chorus."</p></blockquote>

<p>We are aware that some, while
agreeing with us, as they cannot help
but do, that "masses" in figured
music, and "figured vespers," are in
the style of their composition essentially
profane, yet choose them, and
cause them to be performed, on the
plea that the sacredness of the place
and the occasion of the divine office
is a sufficient corrective of their innate
profanity, or that, being "magnificent,"
"sublime," "classic," etc.,
such music may justly be employed
to adorn the grand functions of religion,
and that the theatre ought not
to boast of <em>better</em> music than the
house of God; that&mdash;as one such admirer
of classic music said to us&mdash;we
ought to "spoil the Egyptians;" or
again, that Protestants are attracted to
churches where such music is given,
and may be led by the charm of the
music to inquire into the truths of our
religion; and finally, that there is nothing
else to take its place; the antiquated
Gregorian chant being wholly
unfit for the cultivated musical ears
of the nineteenth century, and to
banish this music from Catholic
churches would be to do an irreparable
injury to high art. But all these
pleas fail absolutely in producing any
influence upon our judgment, the
words of Dom Gueranger sounding
so loudly in our ears as they do, and
our own experience to the contrary.
In point of fact, the sacredness of the
place where this kind of music is
sung is no corrective of the unworthy
nature of the music itself. Doubtless
the cantatrice is denied the clapping
of hands and the <i>encore</i> which her
splendid singing calls for, and the
<i>primo basso</i> retires from the front of
the organ-gallery without a bow to
his fashionable auditory&mdash;nevertheless
interiorly disgusted, we warrant, by
the lack of some visible appreciation
of one of his best efforts&mdash;and a well-behaved
congregation will quietly
resume their attitude of prayer at the
close of some crashing <i>finale</i>; but
are these sufficient evidences of the
very opposite impression being produced
upon the worshippers to that
which the music from its character,
aside from the similar manner of
its rendering, is not only calculated
but is expected to produce? "I
hold it for certain," said good old
Saint Alphonsus, "that vanity and
the devil usually get more by it than
God."</p>

<p>What those who defend the use of
figured music in our solemn offices
must show is, that it not only edifies
the faithful, but that it edifies equally
with, or more than, the authorized
chant. That it is the source of no
little disedification; that it distracts
the soul from the great object upon
which all its powers ought to be concentrated;
that it is always more or
less an imperfect performance, and,
in most cases, a mere makeshift; and
that where the organist and singers
are in power the sacred ministers
play but a subordinate part in a scene
in which, as it has been well said, the
music from the choir gallery is the
magnet which attracts the gold and
silver, there cannot be the shadow
of a doubt.</p>

<p>But this is not all. Is figured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
music in conformity as to its style
with the spirit of the other portions
of the divine office? Will its most
strenuous adherents claim for it the
title of being a fair and true expression
of the Church's prayer? Does
it harmonize with those other parts
of the office performed in the sanctuary?
Here we can speak feelingly.
How often have we not been tempted
to smile at our own voice intoning
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per omnia sæcula sæculorum</i>,
as the echoes of that galloping <i>finale</i>
of an interminable "offertory piece"
or Benedictus were yet resounding
in the aisles of the church! What
feelings of vexation have not arisen in
our breast as the response came back
to our ears in slovenly haste, as if
our inharmonious cadence had too
quickly disturbed the well-merited repose
of our choir after, we must confess,
their too successful effort to captivate
the attention of the congregation,
and put the priest in the very
pillory of singularity and discord!
Why must our mind at such times
suffer the painful distraction of remembering
the well-known sarcastic
remark, that "the Rev. Mr. &mdash;&mdash; then
put up a supplication which was one
of the most eloquent prayers ever offered
to a Boston audience!"</p>

<p>The second plea, that these classic
harmonies, so rich, so melodious, so
sublime, etc., etc., should not be denied
to the greater glory of God, is
of equally small weight, since there
are many other things in nature
and art extremely beautiful in themselves,
truly classic in their conception
and execution, which, it must be
confessed, would hardly bear transporting
to the house of prayer, and
which it would take the heroic virtue
of a saint to refer to the greater glory
of God if exhibited in any place.
We do not object to the offering of
these harmonies to God, but the
question is, Do these harmonies, by
their religious tone and devout style,
offer themselves to God? Does the
Church judge them to be suitable for
her divine offices? Let these questions
be answered in the affirmative,
and our own personal judgment and
sentiments shall go to the wall.</p>

<p>The plea that the music as now
commonly heard in our churches
allures Protestants, and thus brings
them within sight and hearing of Catholic
truth, has been already well
answered in our quotation from Mr.
Nary. For ourselves, judging from
the behavior of the mass of these
visitors, we are forced to the conclusion
that they frequent our churches
where fine music is given because
they can get it at a cheaper rate than
they would have to pay for it elsewhere.</p>

<p>That there is nothing else to take
its place, and that the antiquated
Gregorian chant is unfit for our ears
of modern cultivation, is simply the
plea of ignorance. The established
chant of the Church not only <em>can</em>
take its place, as we shall attempt to
show further on, but as a fact it has
never ceded its right to any other
style of music; and those who know
any thing of the Gregorian chant
scientifically, know that it is our modern
ears that are at fault, perverted
as they have been in their sense and
appreciation of true religious melody
by the sensuous and effeminate spirit
which pervades all modern art.</p>

<p>It is strongly urged that the reintroduction
of the Gregorian chant
in our churches, now wholly committed
to the use of modern music, is
impossible, for the hired singers will
have nothing to do with it. To
which we answer that, as the execution
of the Gregorian chant necessarily
excludes female vocalists from the
choir in accordance with the sacred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
canons, the <i>prima donna</i> will undoubtedly
have to look elsewhere for
an engagement, and very likely the
<i>tenore</i> and <i>basso</i> who sing in the Mass
on Sunday in our church, and perform
in the <i>opera buffa</i> all the rest
of the week, may refuse to employ
their highly cultivated voices in singing
music that affords them so little
opportunity of exhibiting their artistic
powers; but, we may ask, are these
the only favored beings whom God
has endowed with good voices and
the ability to use them? We propose
to enter more fully into this
question of difficulty, and think we
shall be able to show that in this as
well as in other matters, "where
there's the will, there's a way."</p>

<p>In the interests of art, it is asked,
ought not the composition, and by
consequence the reproduction of sacred
music be encouraged? Will not its
banishment from our churches be a
species of vandalism in art greatly to
be deplored? Let us look at this
fairly. What is this so-called "sacred"
music? Is it more or less than the
adaptation of the words of prayer uttered
by the church to concerted harmony
composed as an artistic expression
of the sentiment conveyed by
the sacred words? Surely nothing
more. But what is concerted harmony,
as a rule, "sacred" or "consecrated"
to? To the words of the
offices of the church? By no means.
There is but one kind of music consecrated
to that&mdash;the Gregorian chant.
And, with our hands upon our hearts,
can we say that modern music has
received such an aid in its development
through the composition and execution
of Masses, Magnificats, Offertories,
Tantum Ergos, and the like,
that its present state of advancement
is as much indebted to them as is
popularly supposed, or that their
withdrawal from the service of the
Church would prove any very serious
detriment to it? As pieces of musical
art, the operas and oratorios of
composers are far superior to the
masses they have written, and
we who may choose would much
rather listen to them. We must not
be understood to decry the composition
of so-called sacred music, or the
singing of it. On the contrary, we
would do all in our power to
encourage it; but we object to its
usurping the place of music better
fitted for the divine offices of the
Church, and vastly surpassing it for
such use in every particular. There
is plenty of time, outside of the hour
or two in which we are present at
Mass or Vespers, to hear all the sacred
music we desire or can bear. All we
ask is, let the Church pray her own
prayers and sing her own divine
song without hinderance, or the intrusion
of harmonies as ill-suited to
her voice as they are powerless to
express the emotions of her more than
human soul.</p>

<p>This leads us to the utterance of
a grave complaint against modern
sacred music, namely, the absurd settings
of words by which the divine
offices are not only prolonged to a
tedious extent, but the Holy Church is
made to stammer, repeat, hesitate in
her speech, and fall at last into an
inextricable confusion of tongues.
Did our pious congregation below
stairs know what their singers are
singing up aloft, they would not unfrequently
be reminded of certain
warnings against "vain repetitions."
The Masses of composers who wrote
in the seventeenth and eighteenth
century are not only open to the
charge of being replete with these
vain repetitions, but are full of the
most ridiculous blunders.</p>

<p>And this from Doctor Mozart's
renowned Mass No. 12, which we
have heard so often, and enjoyed so
much! But he is not alone. We
quote from an able paper from the
<cite>Dublin Review</cite> on "Church Music
and Church Choirs:"</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Thus we have a 'Credo' beginning with
the four phrases, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Credo in unum Deum</i>&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Genitum
non factum</i>&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qui propter nos</i>&mdash;and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Et ex Patre natum</i>&mdash;all sung simultaneously
by the four voices. Again, we have a
'Gloria' beginning with the four phrases,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gratias agimus</i> (for the soprano)&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Domine
Fili</i> (alto)&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Domine Deus</i> (tenor)&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Et in
terra pax</i> (bass)&mdash;the whole being dispatched
in two short pages of music!</p>

<p>"As for instances of garblings by the
omission of words and clauses in much of
the popular mass music, they are too numerous
to be mentioned.</p>

<p>"One of the most grotesquely absurd settings,
perhaps, is that of the 'Alma Redemptoris'
of Webbe. The words are divided
into three parts, the first ending with
'cadenti,' the second with 'genitorem,' the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
same music being used for each, <i>and a repeat
and musical interlude coming between</i>. The
consequence is that the adjective '<i>cadenti</i>'
is entirely cut off from its substantive
'<i>populo</i>;' and the whole, as sung, is of
course sheer nonsense. The reason is plain.
Webbe found an air which, by a threefold
repetition, could be applied to the words of
the antiphon, and for this every thing, even
to the grammar of the piece, was sacrificed.
No doubt this is the history of many of the
absurd adaptations we meet with.</p>

<p>"Nothing can go beyond the examples we
have quoted, except, perhaps, the instance
of a composer of the 'light Italian school,'
who by way of producing an original and
striking musical effect in the 'Credo,' made
one voice sing '<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Genitum non factum</span>,'
and another respond '<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Factum non genitum!</span>'
It will be said that these are extreme
cases, and that many of the pieces are not
likely to be used in our churches. Be
it so; still they show what it was the fashion
of certain composers to provide for the
use of the Church, and what is apt to come
of the theory that it does not matter what
is sung by the choir, provided the people do
not hear it. But whether heard or not, the
rules of the Church (and we see how strict
they are on these points) remain the same.
Besides, do we sing merely to satisfy the
ears of an audience? Rather, is not this
the true principle&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">In conspectu Angelorum
psallam tibi, Domine</i>?"</p></blockquote>

<p>To the ignorance, alas! so general,
of what the Church is actually saying
in her holy offices, and what the choir
is singing in her name, as well as
of what they are omitting to sing
as in duty bound, may be attributed
in great measure the apparent indifference
with which the people of our
congregations listen to any musical
production from the choir, be it in
harmony with the season or the festival,
as the case may be, or not, provided
only that the voices are in harmony
with each other. Did they
know better, they would say with
Pope Benedict XIV., who, it seems,
had some of our own abuses to
contend with and reform in Rome
itself, as other popes have had since
his time. Speaking of St. Augustine,
who used to be moved to tears by
the singing (be it well understood,
not of such music as we possess) in
the churches, he says that "the music
moved him indeed, but still more so
the words he heard. But he would
weep now also for grief; for, although
he heard the singing, he could not
distinguish the words."</p>

<p>Let us hear something more of
the opinions of the same holy pope
about figured "sacred music." "The
Gregorian chant is that song which excites
the minds of the faithful to piety
and devotion; it is that music, therefore,
which, if sung in our churches with
care and decorum, is most willingly
heard by devout persons, and is
justly preferred to that which is called
figured or harmonized music. The
titillation of figured music is held
very cheaply by men of religious
mind in comparison with the sweetness
of the Church chant, and hence
it is that the people flock to the
churches of the monks, who, taking
piety for their guide in singing the
praises of God, after the counsel of
the prince of psalmists, skilfully sing
to their Lord as Lord, and serve God
as God with the utmost reverence."</p>

<p>Did we add no more, we think we
have said enough to show that the
employment of figured music for the
divine offices is an abuse. It does
not answer its purpose, and its permission
is nothing better than a winking
at our weakness, (the wisdom of
which, considering all things, we by
no means presume to condemn for
the past,) while the prevailing sensuousness
and libertinism of the times
has debased and emasculated our
taste in true religious art.</p>

<p>But it is a comfort to know that
such music has never received from
the supreme pastors and rulers of the
church any thing more than a reluctant
permission, that the concessions
they have made in its favor have always
been exacted by the force of
circumstances, and that they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
constantly raised their voice in opposition
to it as an abuse, and urged in
the strongest terms of command and
persuasion its abolition, and a return
to the authorized chant, the universal
song of the Church, ever ancient and
ever new.</p>

<p>Dilettanti talk, with an air of superior
knowledge, of the Gregorian
chant as if it were something obsolete,
the uncouth production of a barbarous
and unartistic age. We think
there are not a few other fashions
and modes of religious expression besides
her chant, that the Church has
persistently adhered to, which modern
ideas might with equal justice
denounce as obsolete and of unartistic
origin. As has been well remarked,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This conservatism, if we may so call it,
of the Church, is not confined to plain chant.
The same may be said of the language and
the style of her offices, the dresses of her
clergy and religious orders, and many of
her rites, ceremonies, and customs. The
chant is, therefore, no stranger than any part
of the Church system; and that system being
what it is, the antique character of the
music seems in every way suitable."</p></blockquote>

<p>To be sure. What would we think
of an archbishop to-day standing before
the altar dressed in a frock-coat
with a stove-pipe hat on his head,
and a pair of patent leather boots on
his feet, giving his solemn benediction
<i>en roulade</i>?</p>

<p>What we have said in regard to
the wishes and commands of the
Church, as expressed by the papal
bulls and decrees of councils in regard
to this matter, we propose to
prove by referring the reader to several
of these authorities.</p>

<p>Alexander VII., in his Constitution
36, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Piæ sollicitudinis</i>, 23d April, 1657,
excludes all singing of pieces not
contained in the liturgy or approved
by the Congregation of Rites,
and all profane styles of music. (Bullar.
t. 6.)</p>

<p>The Congregation of the Apostolical
Visitation, July 30th, 1665, enforced
and explained more fully the
constitution of Alexander VII. The
character of the music at Mass and
Office is to be ecclesiastical, grave,
and devotional. Only what is prescribed
for the day or season is to be
sung. It prohibits prolonged solos.
It prescribes that the words are to be
sung as they were written, without
any inversion, addition, or other
change.</p>

<p>The popes, Innocent XI., 1678,
and Innocent XII., 1692, renewed
and enforced similar rules, imposing,
as their predecessors had done, heavy
penalties on choir-masters for disobedience.
(V. Bullar. t. 7.)</p>

<p>In the Council of Rome, 1725,
Benedict XIII. insists upon the ecclesiastical
character of the music to
be used in church. (Tit. 15, cap. 6.)</p>

<p>Benedict XIV., in a circular letter,
enters at large into the subject of
church music, and, while he does not
wholly condemn the use of figured
music, yet deplores the bad taste of
those who employ it, as well as the
great neglect of religion which he attributes
to the careless performance
of the divine offices of the church.
As we have seen already, he distinctly
prefers the Gregorian chant, and refers
in this letter to the decree of the
Council of Trent in regard to it.</p>

<p>Clement XIII., Sept. 17th, 1760,
issued an edict against the abuse of
prolonging the music in church "to
the detriment of devotion and of the
approved rites, and in violation of
the canons and rubrics."</p>

<p>The cardinal vicar of Gregory
XVI., 1842, inveighs against tiresome
repetition and arbitrary inversion of
words.</p>

<p>Pius IX., June 28th, 1853, showed
his great wish for the thoroughly religious
character of church music; for
in his letters establishing the Seminario<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
Pio, in connection with the Roman
Seminary, he ordered that the students
should be taught the Gregorian
chant, and no other. "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cantus Gregorianus,
omni alio rejecto, tradetur.</span>"
(Tit. 5, de studior. ratione.)</p>

<p>The latest instruction issued by the
cardinal vicar, Nov. 18th, 1856, denounces
the scandals caused by the
introduction of profane theatrical music
in the churches, and the interminable
length of their execution, and,
"by express command of his holiness,"
lays down a set of rules which
are to be observed in future. At the
same time the cardinal issued a series
of instructions to composers, from
which it is evident very little encouragement
is given them to write for
the Church, and they are so restricted
that we very much doubt if they care
to put their Pegasus in such a cumbrous
harness as the good cardinal
prescribes.</p>

<p>The late Plenary Council of Baltimore
confirms a decree made in the
former one, which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"That all may be done according to prescribed
order, and that the solemn rites
of the Church be preserved in their integrity,
we admonish pastors of churches
to earnestly labor in removing those abuses
which, in our country, have crept into the
church chant. Let them, therefore, provide
that the music be subservient to the holy
Sacrifice of the Mass and other offices, and
not the divine offices to the music. Let
them also bear in mind that, according to
the ritual of the Church, it is not lawful to
sing hymns in the vernacular language at
High Mass nor at solemn Vespers."<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The wishes of the fathers of the
Council in regard to the Gregorian
chant may be seen in the decree <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">De
Vesperis</i>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Moreover, we judge it to be most desirable
that the rudiments of the Gregorian
chant be taught and practised in parochial
schools, and thus, the number of those who
can chant the psalms well increasing more
and more, gradually the greater part, at
least, of the people, according to the usage
of the primitive church yet preserved in
many places, may be able to join with the sacred
ministers and choir in singing Vespers
and other similar offices; which will be the
source of edification to all, according to
that saying of St. Paul, 'Speaking to one
another in psalms and hymns and spiritual
canticles.'"<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In the same strain many bishops
in Europe have raised their voices
against the profane music which has
crept insidiously into the holy place,
and urged a speedy return to the use
of the ancient chant.</p>

<p>From the authorities we have adduced
we get at the mind of the
Church, and see that it is plainly adverse
to the introduction of the modern
style of music in our sacred
offices, and we have not been able to
find one instance where its use has
been officially permitted in any particular
diocese but with the utmost
reluctance, and not without expressing
at the same time an earnest wish
that the old chant of the Church
might be restored to its primitive
universal use.</p>

<p>There is also a significant fact
not unworthy our notice. Looking
at the Protestant churches around
us, we see that it is only in those
which are fast losing their former
hold upon some form of ritual in
their religious meetings, that elaborate
figured music is finding a home,
and garbled portions of "the masses"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
of Mozart, Haydn, and other
Catholic composers are being sung
to a nauseating adaptation of English
words: while, on the other hand,
those which are with equally rapid
advances returning to the bosom of
unity with the Catholic Church are
cultivating the Gregorian chant to a
degree which ought to put us to the
blush, and imitating, as best they
may, the ecclesiastical and devout
order of Catholic worship, and hold
our figured and florid music in deserved
contempt. Straws show which
way the wind blows.</p>

<p>Sudden revolutions, however, are
not to our mind; and we know
something of the difficulties in the
way of such a reform in the matter
of church music as the Church
evidently desires, and a general
movement toward the ancient discipline
which she would encourage
and bless. Because we cannot do
all in a day is no reason why
we cannot do something in a week.
In England, the clergy have taken
the whole subject to heart, and
have already accomplished wonders.
There are many churches where the
whole services are given entire. All
that is prescribed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de rigueur</i> to be sung
at Mass is sung. Vespers and Compline
strictly according to the breviary
are chanted in more than one
church by the whole congregation.
They have not entirely eliminated
figured music, but are reducing it to
its lowest terms.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
Few churches are
without their boy choirs, trained to sing
the devout song of the sanctuary.
The zealous Archbishop of Westminster
has issued an order that no new
church be opened in his diocese unless
provision be made for a sanctuary
choir. He has not thought it right, as
he says, to enforce the orders of the
former vicars apostolic, "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">F&oelig;minæ
voces ne audiantur in choro</i>," yet he
adds, "All that I can effect by the
strongest expression of desire and by
persuasion, I shall endeavor to effect."</p>

<p>Surely we can also do something
toward aiding the Church in liberating
herself from this captivity to an
expression of her majestic offices so
foreign to the true sound of her own
voice. Looking back upon the days
when the untiring voice of prayer
was ascending to heaven from the
holy sanctuaries of religion, when the
festival days were kept and the faith
was strong and the people devout, a
faith and devotion due in a great
measure to the sacredness of liturgical
worship and the inspiration of the holy
chants, may we not justly mourn the
loss of this ancient fervor, and earnestly
strive to awaken an interest in
what, for so many good reasons, appears
to hold more than an accidental
relation to it?</p>

<p>We have no doubt that the coming
&OElig;cumenical Council will speak in
yet stronger terms in favor of a reform
so vital to the interests of religion
in the whole world.</p>

<p>In subsequent articles we propose
to consider some propositions made
to ameliorate the present state of
things, the characteristics of the Gregorian
chant as the true song of the
Church, and offer some hints as to the
manner of its execution, and the
means of obtaining and holding a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
permanent chorus of singers who
shall make the divine praises resound
in our consecrated Houses of Prayer
in a manner more edifying to the
faithful, and more becoming the Divine
Majesty.</p>

<h2>THE EARLY HISTORY OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
ON THE ISLAND OF NEW YORK.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a><br />

<small>THE COLONIAL DAYS.</small></h2>


<p>The appearance of a new edition
of the brief but valuable and attractive
work which the present Bishop
of Newark issued in 1853, is a matter
of congratulation. The Catholics
of New York City have a history in
this land, and it is too little known.
Bishop Bayley was the first to supply
the want; he wrote, as the title-page
shows, while still connected with the
diocese of New York as secretary to
the late distinguished archbishop;
and of course with singular advantages
for correctness of details and
for a just view of his subject. We
may here ask our readers to pause
and look back with us at the early
history of Catholicity in this busy
metropolis, and trace the progress of
the church from its small beginning
toward its present development, when
we behold it with its archbishop, its
zealous and active secular clergy, its
regular clergy, embracing Franciscans
of the Observance and Capucins,
Dominicans, Jesuits, Redemptorists,
Priests of Mercy, Paulists; its various
orders and congregations devoted to
the instruction of youth, the care of
the orphan, the foundling, the wayward
and the erring, whom it shelters
in its asylums, hospitals, and protectorates,
with a Catholic Publication
Society, and several publishing houses
and journals.</p>

<p>This progress the <i>Brief Sketch</i> of
Bishop Bayley enables us to trace
down to the year 1853, his duties as
bishop depriving him of the leisure
needed to collect and arrange materials
to continue it to the present
time, by including an account of the
progress since the work originally appeared.
But even then, as the title
shows, it professed to treat rather of
the earlier history than of that which
is almost contemporaneous.</p>

<p>The early history of the Catholic
Church on the island of New York
is indeed an attractive and interesting
theme. It opens with the romantic
story of the early Jesuit missions;
for of the visits of the Catholic
navigators, Verazzani and Sebastian
Gomez, we have too little detail to
know whether a priest actually said
mass on our island.</p>

<p>The first priest who is known to
have set his foot on the island of
Manhattan was an illustrious missionary,
who, while on his way from Quebec
to his mission ground on the
upper lakes, was in 1643 taken by
the Mohawks, tortured almost beyond
the power of human endurance, spared
to become the slave of savages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
bearing their burdens in their winter
hunts, in their fishing trips to Saratoga
Lake and the Hudson, on their trading
visits to the Dutch Fort Orange,
where Albany now stands, bearing all,
enduring all, with a soul ever wrapt
in prayer and union with God, till
at last the Dutch overcame his reluctance
and saved him from the
hands of his savage captors, as they
were about to put him to death.
Covered with wounds and bruises,
mutilated, extenuated, scarce human
in dress or outward form, such was
Isaac Jogues, the first Catholic priest
to enter our great city, then in its infancy,
to meet with respect and kindness
from the Dutch, with the reverence
due to a martyr from the two
Catholics, sole children of the ancient
faith then in New Amsterdam.</p>

<p>The stay of this illustrious missionary
was brief, and his ministry was
limited to the confessional, his chapel
and vestments having fallen into the
hands of the Indians, and greedily
seized as trophies.</p>

<p>Governor Kieft displayed great humanity
in his care of the missionary,
and seized the first opportunity to
enable him to return to Europe.
Panting for martyrdom, Father
Jogues remained in his native land
only to obtain needed dispensations
and permission to return to his labors.
On reaching Canada, he found
peace almost made with the Mohawks,
and, proceeding as envoy to
their territory, concluded a treaty.
He was invited to plant a mission
among them, as his associates had
done among their kindred, the Hurons.
But when he returned to do
so, prejudices had sprung up, a hatred
of Christianity as something
baneful had seized them, the missionary
was arrested, treated as a
prisoner, and in a few days put to
death on the banks of Caughnawaga
Creek, on the 18th of October, 1646.</p>

<p>The next priest known to have
visited New York was the Italian Father
Bressani, who underwent a similar
course of suffering, was captured,
tortured, enslaved, and ransomed by
the kindly Dutch; and by them sent
to France. Although he subsequently
published a short account of the
Huron missions, he is entirely silent
as to New Amsterdam, and we know
nothing in regard to any exercise of
the ministry during his stay on our
island.</p>

<p>The first priest who came here actually
to extend his ministry to any
Catholics in the place was the Jesuit
Father Simon Le Moyne, the discoverer
of the salt springs at Syracuse,
and the successful founder of the
Mohawk and Onondaga missions.
His visit was repeated, and there
would seem to be a probability that
he may have actually offered the
holy sacrifice. The real field of
his labors, and those of his associates,
was, however, the castles of the Five
Nations of Iroquois, in which, for many
years, regular Catholic chapels subsisted,
winning many to the faith, and saving
many by baptism in infancy or in
fatal illness. The converts at last began
to emigrate to Canada, where
three villages of Catholic Iroquois
still attest the power of the gospel
as preached by the early missionaries.
Political jealousies, infused by the
English, gradually intensified the innate
dislike of the pagans to Catholicity,
and prejudice, debauchery, and
penal laws at last drove the Catholic
missionaries from a field in which
they had labored with such courageous
and unremitting zeal.</p>

<p>For years the only Catholic missionary
in their territory was Father
Milet, held at Oneida as a prisoner.
Flying visits alone after this kept up
the faith, and in 1709, Father Peter
Mareuil, on the outbreak of war, retired
to Albany, and the mission in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
Iroquois country virtually closed. The
later and tardy Protestant efforts
were in a measure built on these
early Catholic labors, and from Dellius
to Zeisberger they gladly availed
themselves of the pupils of the
Jesuits to form their own instructions.</p>

<p>This Iroquois church has its martyr
missionary Jogues; its martyred
neophytes, who died at the hands of
their countrymen rather than renounce
Jesus to bow the knee to
Aireskoi; and its holy virgin in Catharine
Tehgahkwita, the Genevieve
of New France. Then came the
growth of mustard-seed in the Dutch
colony. We hear of the freedom of
worship achieved and established by
the founders of the Dutch republic.
It is indeed a favorite theme. Catholic
and Protestant alike battled
with Spain, and the blood of both
won the liberty of the Seven United
Provinces. Then as now Catholics
formed nearly half the population of
Holland. But as soon as freedom
was obtained, the Protestants turned
on the Catholics, who had fought by
their sides, deprived them of civil
rights, put their religion under a ban,
expelled them from their ancient
churches. In fact, they halted in
their course of tyranny and oppression,
only when fear dictated a little
prudence.</p>

<p>The very church given to the English
Puritans under Robinson, by the
Dutch authorities, was the church of
the Catholic Beguines, whose residences
encircled the chapel of which
Dutch laws deprived them, in order
to give it to foreigners who reviled
the creed that erected it and the
worship of the Most High so long
offered within its walls.</p>

<p>When New Netherland was colonized,
this fierce intolerance of the
dominant party in Holland excluded
Catholics from the new settlement as
rigorously as Puritan fanaticism banished
them from the shores of New
England. The Catholic Hollander
could not emigrate to the new land.
No worship was permitted but that
of the Protestant church of Holland.
It is well to talk of Dutch toleration,
but it is the veriest myth ever concocted;
and in New Netherland,
though men were received who had
denied Christ and been pirates on
Salee rovers, Catholicity was excluded.</p>

<p>Gradually a few Catholics did creep
into the colony. Father Jogues on
his visit in 1643 found an Irishman
and a Portuguese woman, forerunners
of the four hundred thousand
now on Manhattan Island. Le
Moyne, as we have stated, subsequently
visited the island, and a Dutch
domine avers that he did so in order
to give the consolations of religion
to some Catholic sailors and residents;
but the fanaticism of Holland
was here, and as an illustration of the
freedom of worship supposed to exist,
we find that in 1658 a Catholic
in Brooklyn was punished for objecting
to support a Reformed minister.</p>

<p>By the reduction of New York, in
1664, to the English sway, restrictions
were really if not explicitly removed.
James, Duke of York, was
a Catholic, and his province of New
York was for a time governed by
Colonel Thomas Dongan, also a
Catholic. His character and career
are known to our readers. Under
his administration Catholic priests for
the first time took up their residence
on the island. Unfortunately, we
have little more than the names of
three clergymen and some indication
of the period of their stay; though
hostile notices tell us of one terrible
crime they perpetrated&mdash;they actually
did erect a "Jesuit colledge," and
taught boys Latin. The King's Farm
was assigned as the place for this institution
of learning; but before Catholicity
could take an enduring form,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
James II. was hurled from his throne
for trying to make the Anglican bishops
speak a little toleration. As has
often happened, intolerance, with the
banner-cry of "Liberty," became the
order of the day. New York soon enjoyed
the benefit of a governor of a
true bigot stamp, grandson of one of
the bloodiest butchers in the blood-stained
annals of Ireland, Coote,
Earl of Bellomont. He disgraced
the colonial legislation with penal
laws against Catholics, and characteristically
lied in the preamble of his act.
But he was a stanch Protestant, and
had some curious dealings with Captain
Kidd. The result of this change
in New York affairs was that the
King's Farm slipped into the hands
of the Episcopalians, and they built
Trinity Church on it. There is some
squabbling now about this property;
why not settle the matter amicably
by devoting it to the object originally
intended&mdash;"a Jesuit colledge"?</p>

<p>Under the harrying that began
with Leisler's usurpation of authority
in the province on the fall of James,
and his mad brain full of plots
and "diabolical designs of the wicked
and cruel papists," such Catholics as
had settled in New York seem gradually
to have removed elsewhere;
or, if they remained, reared families
who were strangers to the faith.</p>

<p>Thus far Catholicity in New York
had a strange history. Is it a dream?
Fact first: Enlightened Dutch Protestants,
champions of liberty of conscience,
exclude Catholics, and when
they creep in, tax them to support a
church against the dictates of their
conscience. Fact second: Enlightened
English Protestants, after a
great and glorious revolution, and of
course full of toleration, passed penal
laws subjecting Catholic priests to
imprisonment for life with murderers
and criminals. Fact third: Catholics
during the brief period of their influence
gave the colony a legislature, a
bill of rights, freedom of worship to
all Christians, and a college, and first
attempted to elevate and christianize
the negro slave. Bishop Bayley thus
narrates one of these glorious works:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The first act of the first assembly of
New York convened by Colonel Dongan
was the 'Charter of Liberty,' passed October
30th, 1683, which, among other
things, declares that 'no person or persons
which profess faith in God by Jesus Christ
shall, at any time, be any ways molested,
punished, disquieted, or called in question
for any difference of opinion, or matter of
religious concernment, who do not actually
disturb the civil peace of the province;
but that all and every such person or persons
may, from time to time and at all
times, freely have, and fully enjoy, his or
their judgments or consciences in matters
of religion, throughout all the province&mdash;they
behaving themselves peaceably and quietly,
and not using this liberty to licentiousness,
nor to the civil injury or outward disturbance
of others.' By another enactment,
all denominations then in the province
were secured in their liberty and discipline,
and the like privilege was granted to others
who might come into it."</p></blockquote>

<p>For fifty years the history of Catholicity
on New York island is a
blank. A priest was occasionally
brought in as a prisoner on some
Spanish ship taken by a privateer;
that is all. Catholics are scarcely alluded
to. But an awakening came
in 1741 in one of the wildest excitements
in our annals. Catholics had,
indeed, nothing to do with it, and for
a long time no breath implicated
the few Catholics with the supposed
dangers, till a silly letter of General
Oglethorpe put the idea into the
heads of the New York authorities.
Then the negro question and the
Catholic question, which have so
long alternately afforded a topic for
sensation, and have at times been so
oddly combined, met for the first
time in New York annals.</p>

<p>Bishop Bayley thus describes the
negro plot:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The year 1741 was made memorable
by one of those popular excitements which
shows that whole communities as well as individuals
are sometimes liable to lose their
wits. Upon a rumor of a plot made by the
negroes to burn the city and massacre the
inhabitants, the whole body of the people
were carried away by a sudden excitement.
The lieutenant-governor offered a reward of
one hundred pounds and full pardon to any
free white person who would make known
the author or authors of certain attempts
to set fire to houses in various parts of the
city. A servant-girl, named Mary Burton,
living with a man named Hughson, who
had been previously condemned for receiving
stolen goods, came forward to claim the
reward, declaring that certain negroes who
frequented her master's house (he kept a
small tavern) had made a plot; one of the
accused, named Cuffee, she declared had
said that 'a great many people had too
much, and others too little,' and that such
an unequal state of things should not continue
long.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
The pretended disclosures
increased the excitement, and the lawyers
of the city, to the number of seven, with the
attorney-general, were called together to
take council in regard to the matter. They
certainly manifested very little coolness or
judgment, and may be said to have led on
the unfair and unjust trials which followed.
The accused had no counsel allowed them;
the attorney-general and the whole bar were
on the side of the prosecution; the evidence
was loose and inconclusive, and came without
exception from the mouths of interested
persons of bad character. Yet, upon such
evidence as this, four white persons were
hanged, eleven negroes were burned at the
stake, eighteen hanged, and fifty were transported
and sold, principally in the West
Indies.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
Among those hung was the unfortunate
Mr. John Ury. Whether he
was really a Catholic priest or not, he was
certainly condemned and hung as such.
We have no other evidence upon the matter
than Horsmanden's account, and from this
it does not clearly appear whether he was
really a priest or a nonjuring clergyman of
the Church of England.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
The most conclusive
fact in favor of his being a priest is
founded upon the circumstance that, when
arraigned as a priest, tried as a priest, and
condemned as a priest, he never formally
denied it, nor exhibited any evidence of his
being ordained in the Church of England.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>"The persons most to blame were the
judges and lawyers. The speech of the attorney-general
on the trial of Ury, the sentence
given by Horsmanden upon certain
of the negroes, and that by the chief-justice
on others, are so harsh, cruel, and abusive
that we could hardly believe it possible that
they had uttered them, if they were not
published with the authority of Horsmanden
himself. It is evident, however, that
their 'holy horror of Popery' had as
much to do with the whole matter as their
fear of insurrection among the blacks."</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course after this attack of insanity
New York was scarcely a
place for a Catholic to reside. There
must have been a few; but evidently
they avoided attracting attention.
The next Catholic sensation was that
of a poor creature whose life had
been a sad defiance of all religion
and morality, but who, at her death,
sent some money to the Rev. Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
Inglis, rector of Trinity Church, with
a request that she should be buried
in the church. She was indeed interred
there, till a clamor rose fierce
and loud. She was not only a public
sinner but a Catholic; the latter,
too terrible a sin to forgive, so she
was taken up; but Mr. Inglis never
recovered from the stigma.</p>

<p>Not long before the Revolution,
the few Catholics in New York were
again the object of the zeal of the
Jesuit fathers, with whom so much
of our history is connected. The
mission of the sons of St. Ignatius,
which in Maryland was coeval with
the settlement of that colony, gradually
extended to Pennsylvania and
New Jersey, aided chiefly by the bequest
of Sir John James. The mission
was one involving some danger,
and hence required great caution;
but finally a Catholic priest stood in
New York to begin to gather the
faithful, and administer the sacraments
of which they had been so
long deprived. The priest who formed
this first congregation, the nucleus
of St. Peter's, and thus of all the Catholic
institutions on the Island of
Manhattan, was a German Jesuit,
Father Ferdinand Steinmeyr, known
on the American mission as Father
Farmer. A man of extensive learning,
not only in the theological studies
of his church, but in the natural
sciences, the Royal Society of London
had been glad to add his name
to their list of members. Here he
would have been a fit associate for
Colden, Franklin, and Barton, but
the gratification of this taste would
have made him too conspicuous in a
prejudiced and hostile community;
and the man of science submitted to
be passed by without notice, anxious
only to do his duty as a missionary,
and gather the lost sheep of Israel.
The reticence required unfortunately
leaves us without any direct information
as to his visits, and we do not
positively know when or where this
man, whose learning would have
adorned the colony of New York,
first offered the holy sacrifice for the
pioneer congregation of Catholics in
this city. Bishop Bayley has collected
the various early notes and
hints on this interesting point, but it
is after all involved in great obscurity.
Yet this founder of Catholicity in
New York City lived so recently,
that the writer, who can claim neither
gray hairs nor advanced years,
remembers several who had received
the sacraments of the church at his
hands.</p>

<p>Father Farmer came undoubtedly
with the address of some German
Catholic, and his visit would thus be
less likely to attract attention, as
German clergymen of various denominations
often passed through the
city. Mr. Idley, a German of the
early day, claimed that mass was first
said in his house in Wall street, and
the claim may not be unfounded.</p>

<p>Father Farmer continued these occasional
visits until the breaking out
of hostilities with England. The defeat
of Washington on Long Island
threw New York into the hands of
the English, and for the next seven
years his pastoral visits became impossible.</p>

<p>So long as the colonial dependence
prevailed, the British government
stimulated anti-Catholic fanaticism,
because while this spirit was fanned
the colonies readily gave men and
money to aid in the reduction of
Canada. That French colony, after
many fruitless attempts, at last fell
under the combined efforts of the
mother country and the colonies; but
Canada, once reduced, became the
object of sounder and more dispassionate
statesmanship. By the surrender,
the Canadians were guaranteed
certain rights, as the Irish were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
by the treaty of Limerick. Protestant
governments have never been
over-scrupulous on such points, and
it was as easy to break faith with the
Canadians as with the Irish, but this
time England was honest. The Catholic
Church was left almost intact
in Canada; nay, its clergy continued
under British rule to gather tithes
and receive certain traditional honors.</p>

<p>This was too much for the people
of the older colonies to brook.
They had not lavished blood and
treasure for this. The very bigotry
nurtured by English rule now turned
against it. And what wonder, then,
that the first standard of revolt reared
in New York expressed this long-cherished
feeling, this hatred of Catholics
so long encouraged by government,
what wonder that the flag
of American freedom that first floated
to the breeze in New York bore
the motto, "No Popery"!</p>

<p>How little we can fathom the designs
of the Almighty! Who looking
on that flag could see in it the germ
of a freedom of the church which
she then nowhere out of the patrimony
of St. Peter really possessed?
Yet it was there. Down to the
French alliance, this anti-Catholic
feeling nerved the Whigs and discouraged
the friends of British rule.
Then it changed, and the Tory papers
caught up every occasion to show
how zealously Protestant the British
party was. While the selectmen of
Boston followed a Catholic procession
through the streets, and Congress
went to mass, the British authorities
in New York are pointed out by a
pamphleteer of the day as beyond
reproach. They showed their anti-Catholic
zeal in this way:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In 1778, in the month of February, a
large French ship was taken by the British,
near the Chesapeake, and sent for condemnation
into New York, at that time still in
possession of the English. Among her
officers was a priest, of the name of De la
Motte, of the order of St. Augustine, who
was chaplain of the vessel. Being permitted
to go at large in the city, he was solicited
by his countrymen, and by those of his
own faith, to celebrate mass. Being advised
of the existence of a prohibitory law, he
applied to the commanding officer for permission,
which was refused; but M. de la
Motte, not knowing the language very well,
mistook what was intended for a refusal as
a permission, and accordingly celebrated
mass. For this he was arrested, and kept
in close confinement until exchanged. This
was under Governor Tryon's administration."</p></blockquote>

<p>Benedict Arnold&mdash;for even this precious
worthy may come in as an illustration&mdash;when
he sat down in New
York in his uniform of a British brigadier,
to write his address to his
countrymen justifying the step which
he had taken, and which we are accustomed
to characterize by the ugly
name of treason, made his strong
anti-Catholic feeling justify his course.
He had entered the movement as a
thorough Protestant; but when Congress
began to favor popery, he foresaw
the ruin of his country, and as a
true Protestant made his peace with
England. Strong as the anti-Catholic
feeling had been in the hearts of
the colonists, we do not find that this
appeal of Arnold to their prejudices
induced a single man to desert the
American ranks; it is far more likely
that it may have sent some Irish soldiers
from the British ranks to swell
Washington's regiments.</p>

<p>We are apt to associate our republic
with the idea of unbounded religious
toleration. As we have shown,
hostility to Catholics was a potent
element in arousing the people to
declare against Great Britain, and the
State governments as originally framed
bear deeply impressed the traces of
that common feeling which once, in
Lyons, proclaimed in one line free
toleration in matters of religion, and
in the next prohibited the mass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
under terrible penalties. If freedom
was dreamed of, it was to be one
which we were not to enjoy.</p>

<p>The anti-Catholic feeling that characterized
the first national movement
was displayed in the convention
which in 1777 formed a constitution
for the State of New York.
There no less a personage than John
Jay, subsequently minister to England
and chief-justice of the Supreme
Court of the United States, was the
ardent, fiery advocate of intolerance.
Catholics of New York owe a debt
of gratitude to Gouverneur Morris and
Philip Livingston for the manliness
with which in that convention they
fought the battle of human freedom
and sought to check the onslaught of
intolerance. But they failed. Under
that constitution no Catholic
could be naturalized, and the liberty
of worship granted was couched in
such terms as to justify the legislature
at any time in crushing Catholicity,
and in point of fact they at once adopted
an iron-clad oath that effectually
prevented any Catholic from holding
office.</p>

<p>The <i>Brief Sketch</i> gives the debates
on the interesting questions before
the convention; and it notes how,
in that curious system of language
so common with our public speakers
and writers, this constitution found an
advocate in the late polished Benjamin
F. Butler, of New York, who
praised it in an address before the
New York Historical Society for its
liberality in containing no provision
repugnant to civil and religious toleration,
as though laws excluding
Catholics from citizenship and office
were not slightly repugnant.</p>

<p>In point of fact, however, the hostile
feeling of the earlier days was
soon neutralized, and at the close of
the war New York was virtually free
to receive a Catholic Church.</p>

<p>How, then, Catholicity took root
and grew under the protecting work
of men who</p>

<p class="center">
"Builded better than they knew,"<br />
</p>

<p>how it has spread and done its work
of struggle and triumph under the
federal government, will be the matter
of another article.</p>

<h2>MATTERS RELATING TO THE COUNCIL.</h2>


<p>The following items are condensed
from a letter written to the <cite>Correspondant</cite>,
and from other European periodicals.</p>

<p>Tribunes have been prepared in the
chapel of SS. Processus and Martinus,
where the council will be held for princes,
or their ambassadors, who will be permitted
to attend the sessions, without,
however, enjoying the privileges conceded
to them in former councils. It is
in contemplation to cover the chapel
with a roof of glass, in order to make
the voices of the speakers more easily
audible, as the chapel is equal in size to
an ordinary cathedral. If this is not
done, the ordinary sessions will have to
be held in the great hall, where the mandatum
is performed on Maunday-Thursday.
It is probable that the public will
not be admitted, even to the solemn
sessions, although the doors leading into
the basilica will be thrown open. The
entire pavement of the chapel will be
covered by the magnificent carpet presented
by the King of Prussia. It is
definitely decided that the council shall
be called the First Council of the Vatican.
The first stone of the monument
of the council was laid on the 14th of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
October. It has been determined to
admit the generals of orders and honorary
abbots without jurisdiction to seats
in the council. Two of the four legates
who are to preside in the absence of the
sovereign pontiff have been named, the
Cardinals Bilio and De Reisach. The
preliminary labors of the theologians
have been completed, the commissions
dissolved, and the results of their work
have been formulated ready for presentation
to the council. The Holy Father
has declared that the most complete
liberty of discussion will prevail, and
that no decisions will be approved which
have not been passed by a vote approaching
to unanimity. Mgr. Gianelli,
secretary of the permanent congregation
of the council, has said that the session
of the council will necessarily be a long
one, on account of the great number of
questions to be proposed for discussion.
The mode of publishing the decisions
has not yet been determined. Some
propose that the official journal of Rome
publish a daily <i>compte rendu</i> of the
acts of the session; others, that the
<cite>Civilta Cattolica</cite> be published more
frequently, with an account of the debates
and decrees; while others think
that no publication will be made until
the close of the council. The report
that the Holy Father was displeased with
the <i>mandement</i> of the German bishops
assembled at Fulda is contradicted.
On the contrary, he was well satisfied
with it, and a favorable notice of it has
appeared in the <cite>Civilta Cattolica</cite>. It is
reported that M. l'Abbé Freppel has been
charged with an important commission
in reference to those English Protestants
who may be disposed to come to the
council.</p>

<p>A superb history of the council, illustrated
in the highest style of art, is to be
published at Rome as a private enterprise,
in six folio volumes. The first
will contain the life of the sovereign
pontiff, Pius IX.; the second, the biographies
of the cardinals; the third will
contain a description of all the grand
functions and ceremonies which are
celebrated at Rome; the fourth will contain
a history of all the preceding councils;
the fifth will contain the biographies
of all the prelates who assist at the council;
the sixth will contain the acts of the
council. These volumes will contain a
great number of lithographic portraits,
and of chromo-lithographic illustrations
of the places, scenes, costumes, etc.</p>

<p>All anxiety which may have been felt
in regard to the disposition of the French
Liberal Catholics toward the council is
completely set at rest by the clear and
emphatic declaration of their principal
organ, the <cite>Correspondant</cite>, that they
will submit most unreservedly and joyously
to all its decisions, as expressing
the infallible judgment of the church.</p>

<p>The Grand Master of the Free-Masons
of France has published a circular calling
an extraordinary convention of the
order, to meet on the 8th of December,
in order to issue a manifesto declaring
the principles of universal human right.
The Anti-Council of Free-Thinkers will
also assemble at Naples on the same
day.</p>

<h2>FOREIGN LITERARY NOTES.</h2>


<p>It was simply natural that the universal
desire to hear and learn something
concerning the approaching
&OElig;cumenical Council&mdash;a desire that
with some meant anxiety for serious
knowledge and with others mere idle
curiosity&mdash;should be responded to by
writers willing and able to gratify it.
We should far transcend our prescribed
limits were we to undertake to do
more than give a list of works on the
subject possessing the mere qualities
of serious treatment and some degree
of merit. Of a large class of works on
the council whose object is to vulgarize
the subject we of course make no mention.
Not to speak of pamphlets without
number, France and Germany have
been most prolific in literary productions
concerning the council. Indeed,
in these two countries alone, books of
solid erudition and elevated tone are so
numerous as almost to form a special
encyclopædia, treating of the council
from the various stand-points of history,
law, politics, social philosophy, liturgy,
and theology. And now, scanning
more narrowly the long list, we find
ourselves obliged to pass over in silence
many of them that present the subject
simply as historical, doctrinal, or specially
theological, and to confine our
brief mention to those which distinguish
themselves from the mere treatise by
an exceptional style and tone that render
them more spirited and militant.
We begin with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Société devant le
Concile, par le Chanoine Martinet</i>. For
the great majority of persons outside of
the Catholic Church in England and
the United States, the mere title of this
work is in itself a surprise. They have
been so absorbingly occupied in arraigning
the council before society in
general and before their own little societies
in particular, that it never appears
to have occurred to them that a counter-arraignment
was among modern possibilities.
They have busied themselves,
and for that matter still busy themselves,
in squaring the ability and jurisdiction
of the church by what they are pleased
to call the demands of modern society&mdash;the
ideas of modern civilization; as
though these demands and these ideas
were so perfectly recognized, classified,
and codified as to present a compact
and intelligible system. And yet, if,
going from one to another of the entire
chorus so loudly chanting the hosannas
of the assumed system, we ask what is
this system, you will find that no two of
them agree. If the &OElig;cumenical Council
were to commence its work by a decree
that should meet the views of any
given one out of a hundred of them,
there would arise a shout of malediction
from the other ninety-nine. Suppose
the orthodox Episcopalian to be satisfied,
the Unitarian would inevitably
be discontented. And if the Socialist
could with any reason approve of what
was done, just so certainly it would not
suit his Presbyterian neighbor. Thus,
for instance, take the first fourteen articles
of the so-called "Papal Syllabus,"
of December, 1864, and will any one
undertake to point out the Protestant
country in Europe or in America in
which one half the community would
not be at once arrayed against the other
half on the question as to whether they
are truth or error? People talk of
modern civilization and the spirit of the
age as though these expressions conveyed
a clear and definite meaning, and
represented certain ideas distinctly recognized
as truth by all; as though this
so-called spirit of the age were something
as definite, as tangible, and of as
efficacious an application as a code of
civil law; and as though its practical
working were one of truth and harmony;
whereas, in reality, no incomprehensible
jargon of words, no jumble of ideas, no
jungle of thicket is so helplessly confused
and impenetrable as the maze of
struggling, confused, and contradictory
theories supposed to constitute the
spirit of the age and serve as the exponent
of modern enlightenment. We
are not aware that the author of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
work before us takes this view of the
matter; but it is one so irresistibly suggested
to us by the juxtaposition of
the two statements&mdash;society before the
council, and the council before society,
that we cannot avoid expressing
it. The enemies of the church,
whose fear of her and whose ignorance
concerning her are equally great, have
long announced that she is in her decline;
and yet she is now about to
affirm her existence by a movement
of prodigious vitality&mdash;an &oelig;cumenical
council. The council, pronounced impossible
by a great number, will obtain
its first success by showing the falsity
of the asserted impossibility of the attention
of the world. "The council,"
says the Abbé Martinet, "will do all
that needs be done to classify and render
coördinate without destroying, all
those ideas whose want of unity distracts
us, whose opposition, real or apparent,
creates strife and destructive
collision among social classes and nations.
Not only will it place in the
light grand principles, great truths, but
it will show to all right-minded men
universal Catholic truth, which, in enlightening
and conciliating all truths,
all principles, prevents them from degenerating
into serious errors in theory,
into great iniquities in application.
Possessing the centre of lights that do
not deceive, it will elevate the source of
the vital forces which save individuals,
families, and nations."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Concile &OElig;cumenique et la Situation
Actuelle, par M. l'Abbé Christophe</i>,
presents the main ideas of the preceding
work, with more concision.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L'Influence Sociale des Conciles</i> is
by M. Albert Du Boys, already known
as the author of a meritorious work on
jurisprudence.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
The work now under
consideration is a historical study in
which the author describes the influence
former councils have exercised upon the
past. From a social point of view, the author
shows that the councils have powerfully
contributed to the enfranchisement
and amelioration of humanity by
victoriously combating the material and
moral disorders of rude and barbarous
ages, by their promotion of the foundation
of hospitals and institutions of
charity, by their denunciation of errors
and superstitions injurious to public order
or social well-being, by their gradual
renunciation of clerical privileges
and immunities whenever those immunities
and privileges appeared to have become
anomalous in a new social order.
Showing that all the elements of modern
civilization come to us from and
through the church, the author concludes
that the coming council will not
be less inspired by the spirit of the
gospel than the councils that have preceded
it. The work is accompanied by a
complimentary letter of the distinguished
Bishop of Orleans, who says in it
that the council assembles no less for
the good of civil than of religious society.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lettre sur le Futur Concile
&OElig;cumenique</i>, by the Bishop of Orleans,
a translation of which was given in
<span class="smcap">The Catholic World</span>, has already
reached its seventh edition. The immense
notoriety acquired by this small
book in the Catholic world, and the
letter of felicitation received by its author
from the sovereign pontiff, have
made it so generally known as to dispense
us from very special mention of
it. Bishop Dupanloup thus assigns the
council its place in the firmament of
truth. "It will be," he says, "a rising,
not a setting sun." Addressing himself
to the human mind separated from
the church, he says, "While you disperse,
we unite; while you lose, we retain."
And again, "In all this world,
only the church and the sun are able to
affirm positively that they will arise the
next day, and this is what the church
does in daring, amid the existing tumult,
to announce a council."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Concile &OElig;cumenique, son Importance
dans le Temps Présent</i>, is the title
of a work equally well known in Germany
and in France. It is translated
from the German, and is from the pen
of the Bishop of Mayence, Rt. Rev. Dr.
Ketteler. He demonstrates, with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
well-known learning and eloquence,
than for eighteen centuries the infallible
teaching of the church has had no
eclipse.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another work not less remarkable is
by Monseigneur Deschamps, Archbishop
of Malines, and entitled, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L'Infaillibilité
et le Concile Général</i>. It discusses
the question of the infallibility
of the head of the church.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Finally, the Abbé Jaugey, in his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Petit
Traité Théologique sur le Concile
&OElig;cumenique</i>, appears to have addressed
himself to the class commonly
known as "worldly people." In an
easy and pleasant style he explains on
this grave subject all that such people
desire to know, and at the end of his
work groups under five headings the
subjects most likely to be passed upon
by the council. These are,</p>

<p>First. Speculative truths, or the natural
and supernatural orders and their
mutual connection.</p>

<p>Second. Moral truths concerning
civil society.</p>

<p>Third. Truths concerning marriage.</p>

<p>Fourth. Truths concerning the authority
and the infallibility of popes.</p>

<p>Fifth. Truths concerning the rights
of the church, and its relation to the
state.</p>

<p>Catholic England has lately made a
solid contribution to the historic-critical
literature of the Pentateuch in <i>The
Book of Moses, or the Pentateuch in its
Authorship, Credibility, and Civilization</i>.
By the Rev. W. Smith. Vol. I.
London. 577 pages. It is highly spoken
of by the best German biblical critics,
and specially commended for its
strength in the historical treatment of
the subject.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some two years since, Alfred Ritter
von Arneth edited a volume of the correspondence
between Maria Theresa
and her daughter Marie Antoinette, and
a collection of the letters of the unfortunate
queen of France to her brothers
Joseph and Leopold. Both these works
were not only valuable contributions to
history, but of the most touching interest
to every class of readers. The
same author has now published<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
at
Vienna, the remarkable correspondence
between Catharine, Empress of Russia,
and Joseph II., Emperor of Austria.
Better than the most eloquent essay or
the most erudite history, these letters
show us these two personages in the
truest of colors, and they form edifying
reading for any one not fully and blindly
committed to the belief in the "right
divine of kings to govern wrong." Under
profound assurances of esteem and
the most hyperbolical compliments, you
see an utter absence of respect or of
belief in the honesty, the one of the
other. Each had his or her designs to
accomplish&mdash;that is to say, the stealing
of other people's land and the annihilation
of other people's rights; the manner
of the transaction proposed being
similar to the disposal of a flock of
sheep or the transfer of a turnip-field.
Of their sincerity, take a single specimen.
Joseph writes to Catharine, January
9th, 1781, and forwards the letter to
his prime minister Kaunitz, with the following
confidential note:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon
cher Prince</span>: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voici ma lettre à
l'impératrice; je vous prie d'y ajouter ou

savoir qu'on a à faire avec une femme qui
ne se soucie que d'elle et plus de Russie que
moi; ainsi il faut la chatouiller. Sa vanité
est son idole; un bonheur enragé et l'hommage
outré et à l'envie de toute l'Europe l'a
gâtée. Il faut déjà hurler avec les loups:

<p>Death could not wait for the fruition
of most of their selfish combinations.
Even at this day, nearly a century later,
several important projects discussed
between them have not yet received a

<p>An elaborate work on China is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">France
et Chine. Vie Publique et Privée des
Chinois Anciens et Modernes, etc. etc.</i>
Par M. O. Girard. 2 vols. 8vo. This is
not a mere book of travels, but a work descriptive
of the political, social, civil, military,
and religious institutions of China,
its philosophy, literature, science, and
art. It appears to be the joint result of
personal observation during a residence
in the country, and of long and careful
study of Chinese history and literature.
Coming from an ecclesiastic, we might
naturally expect to find a large portion
of the book filled with accounts of the
missions of the church in China. That
subject, however, receives scarcely more
than mere mention, the author evidently
thinking that such information is
already elsewhere accessible, and that it
is now of more importance to make the
country known in its more peculiar aspects.
The book is too ambitious in its
scope to be thorough, and we think it is
to be regretted that the author did not
rather give us an account of his residence
(if residence he had) in China,
grouping about facts and incidents as
they arose the varied and extensive
knowledge he appears to possess of the
Flowery Kingdom.</p>

<p>In accordance with the desire of several
American bishops of the Catholic
Church, and under the auspices of the
Bishop of Münster, (Westphalia,) the
college of St. Maurice, near Münster,
was founded in the spring of 1867, expressly
for the education of theological
students destined for the priesthood in
missions of the United States. Not
only young men from Germany but from
America, enter the college, of whose
course of studies the English language
forms an important feature. The institution
has already sent forth seven
priests. Persons desiring special information
concerning the institution, may
address, "Rev. Mr. Witte, St. Maurice,

<p>There has lately appeared at Venice
a work<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> equally curious and interesting
on Abyssinia, (Ethiopia,) or rather on its
relations with the republic of Venice.
It shows that centuries ago Abyssinia
had reached as high a degree of civilization
as Europe.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the occasion of the late centennial
anniversary in honor of Macchiavelli,
there was produced a singular literary
work of his, hitherto entirely unknown.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
It is a translation, made by Macchiavelli
himself, of a work written by Saint Victor,
Bishop of Utica, on the persecution
of Christians in Africa, under the reign
of Huneric, King of the Vandals, in the
year 500.</p>

<p>The question so familiar to all Americans
some dozen years ago, Have we a
Bourbon among us? is now practically
asked in England,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> and one Mr. Augustus
Meves disputes the place claimed for
the Rev. Eleazar Williams. For any
one who has seriously examined the historical
paradox involved in this question
there can remain no doubt that the son
of Louis XVI.&mdash;called Louis XVII.&mdash;died
in Paris, and was buried in the
cemetery of the church of St. Margaret,
in the Faubourg St. Antoine, on the
10th of January, 1795. There can also
be as little doubt that Messieurs Williams
and Meves were, with more less
sincerity, impostors.</p>

<p>The great and justly celebrated work
of the Chevalier Rossi on subterranean
Rome has just been published in England
in a translated abridgment.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
It is
a superb volume, beautifully and profusely
illustrated. All that is essential
in Rossi's work has been preserved in
the present, and important additions
made. The work is especially full and
satisfactory concerning the frescoes
of the catacombs, the transition from
pagan art to Christian symbolism, the
sarcophagi, the ceremonies of the primitive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
church, and other similar subjects.
MM. Northcote and Brownlow establish
irrefutably that the catacombs were
never used as a burial-place for any but
members of the Christian church, and
moreover, conclusively show that the
objections presented to this hypothesis
will not bear examination.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>M. Athanase Coquerel fils is well
known as a preacher in one of the
Protestant churches of Paris, and as
the author of two or three works on
literature and the fine arts. During
the past year he delivered a series
of lectures at Amsterdam, Strasburg,
Rheims, and Paris, which, being revised
and corrected, have lately appeared in
a small volume under the title of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rembrandt
et l'Individualisme dans l'Art</i>.
M. Coquerel is troubled&mdash;and very
much troubled&mdash;by the superiority of
Catholicity in art&mdash;is desirous of convincing
the world that it labors under
a mistake, and, if we will consent to
look through M. Coquerel's spectacles,
we will see that it is not only doubtful
if Catholicity possesses the superiority
so generally attributed to it, but rather
certain than otherwise that Protestantism
rightly claims it. Here are two of
the processes by which M. Coquerel
arrives at the results mentioned, and
they are remarkable for their simplicity.
First. Rembrandt was a great genius,
and he owes his greatness to the liberal
element, to the spirit of individualism
of the reformation. Second. Leonardo
da Vinci, says M. Coquerel, "was certainly
great in the domain of art, and
we cannot say that he was absolutely
a stranger to Christian sentiment."
Really, a very handsome admission on
the part of M. Coquerel when we remember
that da Vinci is the painter of
the immortal "Last Supper." "But
what is there in all this," continues our
author, with an apparently serious countenance,
"what is there in all this that
is Catholic?&mdash;a Protestant would not
have conceived the subject otherwise!"
And here was the opportunity for M.
Coquerel to mention the names of half
a dozen or so of Protestant da Vincis;
but, strange to say, he neglects it. The
gentlemen referred to have thus far
eluded public observation. One fact in
connection with this subject is very
suggestive. It is that the superiority
of Catholicity in art may sometimes be
disputed by Protestant ministers and
controversialists, but by artists, never.</p>

<p>It is impossible that any one at all
interested in the history of the faith in
our country should fail to welcome the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
appearance of this memoir of the great
and good priest Father Gallitzin. A
Russian prince of high rank, baptized
and educated as a child in the Greek
schismatical church, he early became
a convert to the Catholic faith. Though
destined by his father, the Prince
Demetrius, for the military service,
Providence directed his steps to America,
where he had scarcely landed when
he felt himself urged, as he says, "to
renounce all his schemes of pride and
ambition, and to embrace the clerical
profession for the benefit of the American
mission."</p>

<p>Ordained priest by Bishop Carroll in
1795, he was sent as a missionary to labor
single-handed in the immense district
of country which now embraces
the dioceses of Pittsburg, Erie, and Harrisburg.
One can easily imagine the
severe hardships and sacrifices that fell
to his lot, and which were nobly sustained
for forty-six years with that apostolic
zeal which always and in every place
distinguishes the Catholic missionary.</p>

<p>Amid the incessant labors and unrespited
fatigues of his career he still
found time to devote himself to literary
pursuits. His <i>Defence of Catholic
Principles</i>, and <i>Letter on the Holy
Scriptures</i>, to-day so widely known, are
clear, logical expositions of the Catholic
faith surpassed by few controversialists.
This little memoir of the learned,
holy, and self-sacrificing priest needs
no commendation from us to insure its
extensive circulation among the Catholics
of our country, while we would
say to those who are not of us: Read
here the life and character of a true
priest, and the labors of a real, <i>bonâ-fide</i>
missionary.</p>

edition.</p>

<p>We are sorry not to have had this
volume before our eyes when called
upon to notice the same work, in simple
melody without accompaniment, issued
some months ago. The harmonies
enable us to interpret the movement,
which alone we deemed ill regulated.
We are aware that it is extremely
difficult to express in musical notation
the melodic movement of Gregorian
chant, and that even the same phrase
is dependent, as to the style of its execution,
upon the spirit of the season or
festival when it is sung. Pure Gregorian
chant is not rhythmical in its measure,
yet we think that a work intended
for the use of our singers and organists,
who, as a class, are utterly ignorant of
its traditional expression, might very
well be so arranged as to afford an approximative
notion of it. The notation
in this work does not make any such
attempt, but gives a simple translation
of the ancient Benedictine melody
into semibreves and crotchets, without
further direction. If sung rigidly
according to the relative length of
the notes as they are written, most
certainly the singer would fail to give
the true expression either of the Latin
or of the melody in several phrases.
A careful study would perhaps correct
this in many instances. Since our reception
of the book we have had the
pleasure of hearing this chant rendered
by one perfectly competent to give its
true meaning, and must confess that it
disarmed all adverse criticism. On
principle we object to the introduction
of the sensible note which prevails
throughout, but do not wish to quarrel
with those who, contrary to us, deem it
only a matter of taste. Every organist
would do well to procure and study
this most praiseworthy contribution to
the much to be desired reformation in
our church music.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">German Tales.</span> By Berthold Auerbach.
With an introduction by C.
C. Shackford. Boston: Roberts
Brothers.</p>

<p>This volume, containing five short
German tales, is a charming book, replete
with life and spirit, full of beautiful
descriptions of quaint German customs,
and overspread with wise and gentle
teachings that are "like apples of gold
in pictures of silver."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span></p>

<p>Pure morals, kindliness, and heartfelt
interest in the brotherhood of man
breathe through these pages.</p>

<p>It is entirely free from that vein of
self-conceit so visible in <i>Villa Eden</i>,
by the same author, and the pages are
not sullied by the infidel opinions which
mar that volume; opinions "that have
no sure, firm soil out of which they
grow, but skip about like a 'will-o'-the-wisp'
in the blue ether, very readily
changing from transcendental to nonsensical."
Indeed, we think these early
German tales a great <em>improvement</em> on
his later works.</p>

<p>Auerbach displays a keen power of analyzing
hearts and motives, bringing to
light the hidden springs of action; and
in these stories it is done with such
kindliness and evident desire to look on
the best side of human nature, that his
searchings of the heart leave no sting.</p>

<p>The book is in excellent type and
paper, and, being of the "Handy Volume

Translated, edited, and enlarged
from the French of Arthur Mangin,
by the translator of <i>The Bird</i>. With
one hundred and thirty illustrations
by W. Freeman and I. Noël. London:
T. Nelson &amp; Sons, Paternoster
Row; Edinburgh and New York.
1868.</p>

<p>M. Mangin has chosen a grand subject,
and treated it in a masterly and
comprehensive manner. He takes us
back to the very beginning of Old
Ocean, when "Darkness was upon the
face of the deep, and the Spirit of God
moved upon the face of the waters."
These ages of chaos give him an opportunity
of setting forth innumerable
theories&mdash;enough to suit even the most
scientific; and fancies enough to please
the most imaginative. Here is his picture
of the primeval ocean: "Imagination
not unwillingly pictures to itself
the strange and superb spectacle of a
limitless ocean seething over its volcanic
bed, and heaving in every direction
its contending billows, kindled here and
there by the blood-red lustre of a glowing
sky, struggling through a dense and
stifling mist; while in its waves myriads
of invisible beings, embryos of future
organisms fighting for life, and rising to
the surface in quest of inspiring light,
wait expectant, amidst the throes of the
terrible stir and tumult all around them,
the dawn of the true day upon a completed
world." However, from the time
that ocean becomes the ocean that we
know it, he gives innumerable facts regarding
its tides, circulation, convulsions,
atmosphere, winds, and tempests.
The living sea-weeds, the plant animals,
the fishes of the ocean and even the
sea-birds, are not forgotten in this study
of the mysteries of the ocean.</p>

<p>The relations of man to the ocean
are also treated of&mdash;navigation, whale
and seal fishing, etc. Altogether the
book is most interesting, is finely got
up, and is fully illustrated with excellent
engravings.</p>

<p>This is a companion book to the

notice we can give this elegantly printed
and illustrated volume is to let the author,
in his preface, speak for himself:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span></p>

<p>"The area of our present work would
be very limited if we understood the
word <em>desert</em> in its more rigorous signification;
for we should then have only
to consider those desolate wildernesses
which an inclement sky and a fertile
soil seem to exclude for ever from man's
dominion. But by a license which
usage authorizes, we are able to attribute
to this term a much more extended
sense; and to call <em>deserts</em> not only the
sandy seas of Africa and Asia, the icy
wastes of the poles, and the inaccessible
crests of the great mountain-chain,
but all the regions where man has not
planted his regular communities or permanent
abodes; where earth has never
been appropriated, tilled, and subjected
to cultivation; where nature has maintained
her inviolability against the encroachments
of human industry."</p>

<p>The author has made a most interesting
and instructive work, one that can
be read with much interest and profit.
His description of the mountain regions
of the world is especially good.</p>

the Rev. Father Lacordaire. Member
of the same Order, of the French Institute,
etc. New York: P. O'Shea,
27 Barclay Street. 1869.</p>

<p>All that was mortal of the great Lacordaire
sleeps in the grave; but men
such as he are not born to die&mdash;they belong
to all time; their spirit for ever
lives and breathes in their works. His
was the eloquence that possesses the
true trumpet ring that stirs men's souls;
even when read, it is powerful.</p>

<p>The work before us was first published
in 1839. In a masterly manner it
exposes the absurdity of liberty proscribing
liberty; of giving license for
all things save serving God in the most
perfect manner, and according to the
very <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau ideal</i> of Christianity. Then,
in a summary and graphic manner, it
sketches the history, and points out the
great names and the eminent services
of one of the great bodies of the church
militant&mdash;an order from whose ranks
have been taken four popes, seventy
cardinals, archbishops by hundreds, and
bishops by thousands; which has produced
theologians, artists, and architects
who rank with the first; which
has sent forth tens of thousands of
missionaries, who have preached the
Gospel in every language under the
sun, and which has the glory of being
able to point at the same time to Aquinas,
the Corypheus of theologians, and
to Las Casas, the slave of the enslaved
Indians.</p>

<p>This book is especially <i>à propos</i> at
the present, when the dogs of the press,
after scouring the world through years
of famine and lack of popish horrors,
have just dropped the sorry bone picked
up four thousand miles away in Cracow,
hungrily passed from mouth to
mouth, and found, alas! to be in reality
without a vestige of consolatory meat&mdash;dry
bone, "and nothing more."</p>

in its Authorship, Credibility,
and Civilization.</span> By Rev.
W. Smith, Ph.D. For sale by the Catholic
Publication Society. (Second
Notice.)</p>

<p>At the time of writing our first notice
of the first volume of this great work,
we had merely glanced at its contents,
and were only able to give a first impression
of its merit. Since that time
we have read it carefully, and made use
of it in giving a course of lectures to a
theological class. We deem it, therefore,
due to the author and to the interests
of sacred science that we should
express our deliberate judgment that it
is a work of the highest erudition and
merit. The Mosaic authorship of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
Pentateuch is proved by the learned
author with all the cogency and conclusiveness
of a complete moral demonstration.
Not only is it by far the best
work on the subject in the English language,
but it is admitted by Dr. Reusch,
the learned editor of the Bonn <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Litteratur
Blatt</i>, to be equal to the best of
the German treatises, and acknowledged
by the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Katholik</i> of Mayence to be
superior to any of them. The latter
periodical criticises Dr. Smith for the
statement made by him that Moses
imitated several things in the Egyptian
sacred rites in his ritual laws. The
critic admits the similarity between
them, but asserts that Moses prescribed
these rites by divine revelation. We
venture to suggest that this is an irrelevant
remark. The inspiration of the
Divine Spirit may have directed him to
imitate whatever was really excellent in
Egyptian institutions, whether sacred or
secular.</p>

<p>We hail this admirable work with
the greatest joy, and await with anxious
expectation the publication of the succeeding
volumes. No professor of sacred
science or student of the Holy
Scriptures should be without it. Neologians
and irrationalists are being
crushed by the very science of criticism
which they have so loudly vaunted as
their own peculiar and irresistible engine
of destruction for the overthrow of
revelation. It is perhaps needless to
add that Dr. Smith is a young, hitherto
unknown priest of a small country mission
in Wales.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Lange's Commentary on Romans.</span>
New York: Charles Scribner &amp; Co.</p>

<p>This is one volume of a commentary
on the Old and New Testament, prepared
by several learned Protestant divines
of Germany, and translated by
competent scholars into English. It is
esteemed among the orthodox Protestants
as the ablest work of the kind
which they possess. It is certainly far
superior to the dull, old-fashioned commentaries
which were formerly used to
produce compression of the brain in
their unfortunate readers. To a Catholic
scholar the work may be useful in so
far as it throws the light of patient
German investigation on critical and
historical questions. Its exposition of
doctrine is chiefly interesting as showing
the views at present prevailing
among the sounder portion of Protestants,
which we may add are a decided
improvement on the original doctrines.
In the volume on Genesis we were surprised
to see two ridiculous statements
dictated by anti-Catholic bigotry, one
that a pope condemned the doctrine of
the antipodes, the other that Cardinal
Cullen denounced the Copernican system.
This is not creditable to a professor
in Bonn University.</p>

beginning of the present century, commenced
her series of novels, the public,
says one of her later critics, "was surprised
by novels which contained neither
ruinous towers, terrible subterranean
cells, nor mysterious veils, and in
which the characters were neither peers
nor foundlings." The works, too, were
remarkable for their humane sympathies
and their moral tendencies, as well
as for their disregard of the materials
out of which it was then the fashion to
construct romances. The same writer
mentions the fact that among the most
ardent admirers of them was Sir Walter
Scott, who avows that it was her
humorous, tender, and admirable delineations
of Irish character which prompted
him to attempt similar portraitures
of his own country.</p>

<p>To those persons especially who
have a leisure hour to while away in
reading a pleasant, chatty book, we commend
this volume with hearty good-will.
The first paper, "Concerning Boys,"
abounds in sallies of wit, with a good
deal of what we would call "wholesome
thought." The author need not have
given us an apology for its publication,
as he does in his preface; but we think
the one he offers deserves more than a
favorable notice on account of its singularity.
We reproduce it, therefore, in
this place, hoping that many will purchase
Father Fitzgerald's little work,
not only because of its intrinsic merits,
but with a view to thereby increase
their own:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I must build a church for a poor and
sparse congregation, and I propose to get a
portion of the necessary funds from the
sale of my book.... I do not rush
into print because I judge that these, my
literary wares, of themselves and on their
own merits, have any valid claim to acceptance;
nor because I suppose that I have
any thing novel or striking in point either
of expression or matter to offer. Far from
me be such presumptuous thoughts! In
sending forth this little volume I do but, as
it were, don my beggar's garb, and take my
stand in public places, which any beggar
may do without offence. It is by this
view of the case alone that I justify my
cause, which else would surely require an
ampler apology. This consideration alone
led me to address a circular to the reverend
clergy which, I doubt not, was by
many regarded as the height of impudence.
Now, however, after this explanation, I
hope I shall be pardoned my intrusion, and
aided in a good work, in spite of my awkward
presumption. I will say this, however,
that I was encouraged to try this
means of collecting money for my church
by two considerations. The first was, the
well-known generosity of the clergy as patrons
of books; and then the novelty of the
thing, which could hardly fail to get me

assert that this little book is, of its class,
as nearly perfect as is possible. While
as a text-book this work has deservedly
enjoyed a very large circulation in its
previous editions, the present one has
several additional and weighty claims
to general approval. We are told in the
preface "that the portion embracing
sacred and ancient history has been, in
a measure, rewritten. In modern history,
the chapters on Greece and Switzerland,
and portions of other chapters,
are new, the whole being brought down
to the present time. Errors and inaccuracies
of whatever kind have been
carefully rectified. Superfluities have
been retrenched, and facts equally important
to be known as those already
stated, introduced." After a thorough
and careful perusal of the book, we can
fully indorse the above, and give the
publishers our best wishes for its success,
trusting with them that "it will
now find its way into a still wider circle

<p>Of the literary merit of these sermons
there can be no two opinions. It is
also undeniable that there is much to

much that is true and valuable in his

poison of rationalism in them to make
them profitable or even safe reading for
any except well-instructed theologians.
Clergymen will find them, however,
valuable to themselves as models of
style and of the art of sermonizing, especially
in regard to the use to be made
of the narratives of Scripture history,
and the application of religious doctrine
to the affairs of human life. The portrait

and tendencies of contemporary Protestantism&mdash;a
work not uncalled for,
since those old Catholic populations,
seldom coming into personal
contact with Protestants, have not
kept themselves well posted in the
changes, developments, and transformations
that Protestantism has undergone
during the last two centuries,
and are hardly able to recognize it
in its present form, or to meet and
combat it with success. The great
controversial works of the seventeenth
century, excellent as they were
in their time, only imperfectly serve
the present wants of Catholic polemics;
for the dogmatic Protestantism
they met and vanquished is,
save in its spirit, not the Protestantism
that now confronts the church. That
primitive phase of Protestantism has
passed away, never to reappear, and
a new and a very different phase has
been developed, which demands a
new study and a new and different
mode of treatment.</p>

<p>The learned Abbé Martin, favorably
situated for his task, during several
years, at the gate of Geneva, the
Protestant Rome, has embodied in his
volume the result of much serious
and conscientious labor devoted to
this new study, and has so well accomplished
his task as to leave nothing
to be desired, till Protestantism
undergoes another metamorphosis,
which it is not unlikely to do; for to
assume new forms or shapes according
to the exigencies of time and
place, is of its very essence. For
this reason, the labor of refuting or
even explaining it can never be regarded
as finished.</p>

<p>It is the characteristic of Protestantism
to have no fixed and permanent
character, except hatred of Catholicity.
It has no principles, doctrines, or
forms, which in order to be itself, it
must always and everywhere maintain.
It may be biblical and dogmatic,
sentimental or sceptical, combine
with absolutism or with the revolution,
assert the divine right of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
kings and passive obedience with the
old Anglican divines, or shout, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à bas
les rois</i>, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vive le peuple! vive liberté,
égalité, et fraternité!</i> with the
old French Jacobins and contemporary
Mazzinians and Garibaldians,
as it finds it necessary to carry on its
unending warfare against the church,
without any change in its nature or
loss of identity. It is not a specific
error, but error in general, ready to
assume any and every particular form
that circumstances require or render
convenient. It, like all error, stands
on a movable and moving foundation;
and to strike it we are obliged
to strike not where it is, but where it
will be when our blow can reach it.
The abbé is well aware of this fact, and
sees and feels the difficulty it creates.
Hence he regards Protestantism as
imperishable, and holds that our controversy
with it must, under one
form or another, continue as long as
error or hostility to the church continues,
which will be to the end of
the world.</p>

<p>To those of us who were brought
up Protestants, who have known
Protestantism in all its forms by our
own experience, the Abbé Martin
tells little, perhaps nothing that had
not previously in some form passed
through our own minds, and not
much that had not already been published
among us by our own Catholic
writers. It is not easy to tell an
American Catholic any thing new of
Protestantism. There is no country
in the world where Protestantism is
or can be so well studied as our own;
for in no other country has it had so
free a field for its development and
transformations, or in which to prove
what it really is and whither it goes.
It has suffered here no restraint from
connection with the state, and till
quite recently the church has been
too feeble with us to exert any appreciable
influence on its course. It
has had in the religious order every
thing its own way, has followed its
own internal law, and acted out its
nature, without let or hinderance.
Here it may, therefore, be seen and
studied in its real character and essence.</p>

<p>But if the Abbé Martin has not
told us much that we did not already
know, or which American writers
had not already published, he has
given us a true and full account of
the present aspects and tendencies
of Protestantism throughout Europe,
very instructive to those Catholics
who have had no personal acquaintance
with it, and not unprofitable
even to those who, though converts
to the church, were familiar with it
only as seen in some one or two of
the more aristocratic sects, in which
large portions of Catholic tradition
have been retained. We in fact wonder
how a man who, like the abbé,
has had no personal experience of
Protestantism, who has never had
any internal struggle with it, and has
been brought up from infancy in the
bosom of the church and in the Catholic
faith, can by study and observation,
by prayer and meditation,
make himself so fully master of its
real character, and come so thoroughly
to understand its spirit, its internal
laws and tendencies. No doubt
one who has been a Protestant,
and knows thoroughly its language,
can find in his work proofs that Protestantism
was not his mother tongue,
and that he knows it only as he has
learned it; but learned it he has, and
knows it better than it is known by
the most erudite and philosophical
Protestant ministers themselves, and
the Catholic reader may rely with
full confidence on his expositions.
The work is, in fact, an admirable supplement
alike to Bossuet's <i>Variations</i>
and to Moehler's <i>Symbolik</i>.</p>

<p>It will startle some Catholics, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
doubt, to hear the well-informed author
assert, as he does, that Protestantism
is not dead or dying, that it is
imperishable, its principle is immortal,
and never was it a more formidable
enemy to the church than it is at this
present moment; but they will be
less startled when they learn what
he means by Protestantism.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Protestantism," he says, "differs essentially
from all the heresies that have previously
rent the bosom of the church. It
is not a particular heresy, nor a union of
heresies; it is simply a frame for the reception
of errors. Vinet, one of the most distinguished
Protestants of the day, softens,
indeed, this expression, and says that 'Protestantism
is less a religion than the place
of a religion.' He would have been strictly
exact, if he had said Protestantism is less
a religion than the place of any negation of
religion under a religious garb. It is a circle
capable of indefinite extension, of being
enlarged as occasion requires, so as to include
any and every error within its circumference.
A new error rises on the horizon,
the circle extends further and takes it in.
Its power of extension is limited only by its
last denial, and is therefore practically illimitable.
What it asserted in the beginning
it was able to deny a century later; what it
maintained a century ago it can reject now;
and what it holds to-day it may discard to-morrow.
It may deny indefinitely, and
still be Protestantism. It can modify,
change, metamorphose, turn and return itself
without losing any thing of its identity.
Grub, caterpillar, chrysalis, butterfly, it is
transformed, but dies not." (Pp. 1, 2.)</p></blockquote>

<p>All this is perfectly true. Protestantism
undoubtedly differs essentially
from all the particular heresies of
former times, such as the Arian, Macedonian,
Nestorian, Eutychian, Pelagian,
etc.; but we think it bears
many marks of affinity with ancient
Gnosticism, of which it is perhaps
the historical continuation and
development. Gnosticism was not a
particular or special heresy, denying
a particular article, dogma, or proposition
of faith. The Gnostics held
themselves to be the enlightened
Christians of their times, men who
had attained to perfect science, been
initiated into the sacred mysteries
concealed from the vulgar, professed
to be spiritual men, spiritually illuminated,
and looked down with contempt
on Catholics as remaining in the
outer court, sensuous and ignorant,
knowing nothing of the Spirit. This
is no bad description of contemporary
Protestants. They call themselves
the enlightened portion of mankind,
claim to be spiritual men, spiritually
illumined and instructed in the profoundest
mysteries of heaven and
earth; while from the height of their science
they look down on us Catholics
as simply sensuous men, having only
a sensuous worship, and hold us to
be a degraded, ignorant, superstitious,
and besotted race. We are very
much disposed, for ourselves, to regard
Protestantism as Gnosticism modified
to suit the taste, the temper,
the mental habits, and the capacity
of modern times.</p>

<p>The author makes Protestantism
not a special heresy, nor yet a union
of heresies, but the receptacle of illimitable
denials; yet he throughout distinguishes
it from absolute unbelief in
Christianity, and maintains that even
as so distinguished it is imperishable,
and its principle immortal. We confess
that we do not see how he can
make this distinction without giving
to Protestantism a specific character
and making it a positive heresy, and
not simply a frame for the reception
of heresy or heresies. Assuming it
to be a positive heresy, and not the
general spirit of error adapting itself
to any and every form of error, his
reasoning is far from satisfying us
that it is imperishable. The assertion
that "its principle is immortal," can
in no case be accepted; for all error
must ultimately die, and only truth
survive, if our Lord is to overcome
all his enemies, and God, who is
truth itself, is to be all in all. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
not to be supposed that they who
are eternally lost continue to err
and to sin for ever. They know
and confess the truth at last, and it is
their severest hell that they know
and confess it when it is too late for
it to liberate them. Understanding
Protestantism to be the general spirit
of error, we can concede it to be imperishable,
in the sense that the world
is imperishable; for men will hate
Christ and deny him as long as the
world stands; but in no other sense
are we prepared to concede it.</p>

<p>The author defines the essence of
Protestantism to be hatred of the
church, and yet throughout his book
distinguishes it from absolute infidelity
or unbelief. We do not see the
propriety of this distinction, nor understand
how he can consistently exclude
from Protestantism any form
of error that hatred may assume. He
makes Protestantism not a particular,
a specific heresy, but the frame in which
any negation of religion under a religious
garb may be set. We see no ground
for this restriction, and it seems to
us that it contradicts his own assertion
that Protestantism is a circle capable
of indefinite extension, and practically
illimitable; for if the circle can
include only the denials of religion
that wear a religious garb, it is not
illimitable, or capable of indefinite extension.</p>

<p>The learned abbé, we suspect, has
been led into this real or apparent contradiction
by neglecting to distinguish
sharply between Protestants and Protestantism.
Protestants are of all
shades, from the Calvinist down to
the unitarian or rationalist, from the
high-churchman down to the no-churchman.
The great majority of
them retain some shreds of Christian
belief, read the Bible, look to Christ
as the redeemer of mankind, and are
governed more or less in their opinions,
sentiments, and conduct by
Christian tradition. It would be a
great mistake as well as gross injustice
to represent all or even many of
them as actually or intentionally unbelievers
in Christ, or to hold them
to be, in the way of error, any thing
more than heretics. But Protestantism
is not a form of heresy, is nothing
in itself but hatred of Catholicity
or hostility to the church of God;
and there are no lengths in the way
of denial it will not go, if necessary
for its gratification. It is potentially
absolute infidelity.</p>

<p>This seems to be in reality the
abbé's own doctrine, and its truth is
evident from the fact that the general
tendency of Protestants is not
toward Catholicity, but farther and
farther from it. Individuals among
them, in certain times and places,
even in large numbers, manifest decided
Catholic tendencies, and ultimately
find their way back to the
church; but whoever knows Protestants
well, knows that the mass of
them, if driven by Catholic polemics
to choose between the church and
the denial of Christianity, indeed,
of all religion, will not choose the
church. "If I can be saved only by
becoming a Catholic, I do not wish
to be saved," said a Protestant minister
to us one day. "I would rather
be damned than be a Catholic."
We politely assured him he could
have his choice. This minister expressed
only the too common sentiment
of Protestants. A certain number
among them, when convinced that
Catholicity and Christianity are identical,
will, the grace of God moving
and assisting, become Catholics; but
every day's experience shows that the
larger number of them love Christianity
less than they hate Catholicity,
and will become infidels sooner
than they will become Catholics. In
doing so, are they illogical? Do
they reject Protestantism, or simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
follow out its spirit to its last logical
consequences?</p>

<p>The learned abbé restricts Protestantism
to such negations as wear a
religious garb. But with us, in what
is called Free Religion, we have seen
infidelity itself wearing the garb and
speaking the language of religion. In
France there are the positivists, real
atheists, who clothe themselves with
a religious vestment, adopt a ritual,
and observe a regular worship.
These, if the author insist on his restriction,
must be included within the
Protestant circle, and if these are included,
it will be difficult to say what
class of enemies of Christ and his
church are to be excluded. We see
no good reason, therefore, for any restriction
in the case. Protestantism
is made up of negations, without any
affirmation or positive truth of its
own; and no reason can be assigned
why we should not hold it capable
of including within its circumference,
without loss of identity or essential alteration,
any or all errors against the
Catholic Church, and if as yet only
heretical with the many, why it is not
capable in its developments of becoming
downright apostasy or complete
denial of Christianity.</p>

<p>Taken in this sense, we admit that
Protestantism is not dead, nor dying;
but will continue to confront the
church to the end of time. The
church in this world is always the
church militant. She will always
have her enemies with whom she can
never make peace so long as she remains
faithful to her Lord. "Think
not," said our Lord, "that I am
come to send peace on the earth;
nay, a sword, rather." The synagogue
of Satan stands always over
against the church of God, and the
world will always hate the church as
it hated our Lord himself; for she
is not of the world as he was not of
it. Yet we attach no great importance,
if this be its meaning, to the
proposition, "Protestantism is imperishable,"
which the Abbé Martin labors
hard and at great length to
sustain; for it is only saying in other
words that hatred to the church will
continue till the consummation of the
world.</p>

<p>But if the proposition means that
Protestantism under its original or
even its present form, as held by the
mass of Protestants, is imperishable,
we can only say, nothing proves it to
our satisfaction. That the essence of
Protestantism, which the author defines
to be hatred of Catholicity, will
continue as long as the world stands
we do not doubt; but nothing proves
to us that it may not change its form
in the future as it has done in the past,
or that the great body of Protestants
may not gradually eliminate all that
they have thus far retained of Christian
tradition or Christian belief, reject
even the Christian name, and
lapse into pure Gentilism, as they are
already lapsing into carnal Judaism.</p>

<p>The abbé, while he is strictly correct
when telling us what Protestantism
is, that it is less a religion than
the frame for the reception of all possible
anti-Christian negations, yet
seems in much of his reasoning with
regard to its future to proceed as if
he held Protestantism to be, not an
immutable system indeed, but, after
all, something definite and positive or
affirmative. He knows as well as
we do, and abundantly proves in his
book, that Protestantism affirms nothing,
contains as peculiar to itself
no affirmative proposition whatever.
The affirmative propositions held by
Protestants are simply fragments of
Catholic truth taught and held fast
in their integrity by the church long
ages before Luther and Calvin were
born, and constitute no part of Protestantism.
The Protestantism is all
in the perversion, corruption, or denial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
of Catholic truth. There is nothing
in it of its own but its negations
and hatred of the church, her faith,
her discipline, and her worship, to be
continued, or that can be the subject
of any predicate. Protestantism receives
into its bosom one form of error
as readily as another, and complete
unbelief as the inchoate apostasy
called heresy, though we readily
grant that the majority of Protestants
are not, as yet, prepared to accept infidelity
pure and simple; and many
of them, we trust, are, in their intentions
and dispositions, prepared to
accept and obey the truth when made
known to them, and may yet in God's
gracious providence find their way
into the Catholic communion and be
saved.</p>

<p>The Reformers, or the fathers of the
modern Protestant movement, did
not intend to give up Christianity or
the church. They thought they
could reject the papacy and the sacerdotal
order, and still retain the
Christian faith and the Christian
church. But they were not slow to
discover that this was impracticable,
and that, if they gave up the papacy
and the sacerdotal order, they must
give up the sacraments, save as unmeaning
rites, infused grace, the merit
of good works, the church as a living
organism, the whole Mediatorial
work of Christ in our actual regeneration,
and fall back on immediatism,
and deny all living or present
Mediator between God and man.
Their successors have found out that
an irresistible logic carries them farther
still, and requires them to reject
all creeds and dogmas as superfluous,
to resolve faith into confidence, and
to rely solely on the immediate internal
illumination and operations of the
Holy Ghost. A new generation is
beginning to discover that even this
is too much, and is preparing to attribute
to nature and the soul what
its predecessors had attributed to the
immediate supernatural operations of
the Spirit. There is but one step farther,
and you have reached the goal,
that of resolving God himself into the
human soul, or the identification of
God with man and man with God,
and not a few have already taken it.</p>

<p>Protestant experience has proved
that the Catholic system is homogeneous,
self-consistent, all of a piece,
so to speak; woven without seam, and
not to be parted; that it must either
be accepted or rejected as a whole.
We do not say that all or the majority
of Protestants see this; but many
of them see it, and their vanguard
loudly proclaim it, and declare the
issue to be, Catholicity or rationalism,
that is, naturalism. There is no middle
ground tenable, to a logical mind
with a courage equal to its logic, between
the two. It must be either
the church or the world, Catholicity
or naturalism, God or atheism. We
know great bodies move slow, and
the great body of Protestants will not
come to a full conviction of this to-day
nor to-morrow; but they are tending
to it, and can hardly fail, in the
natural course of things, one day to
reach it. Having reached it, we
think the sincere and earnest Protestants,
who love and study the Bible and
mean to be Christians, will be gathered
into the Catholic fold, and the
others most likely, other things remaining
as they are, will follow their
Protestant spirit into naturalism, and
give up Christian baptism and Christian
faith altogether.</p>

<p>The author tells us that there are
two very obvious tendencies among
Protestants: the one a tendency
to return to the church, and the
other a tendency to rationalism and
complete infidelity; but he thinks
there will always remain in the non-Catholic
body a certain number of
honest, pious souls who shrink from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
unbelief, and yet, while they hold on
to certain shreds of Christianity, will,
from ignorance, prejudice, and other
causes, continue to protest against the
Catholic faith. He supposes that
among Protestants there are large
numbers of such persons, who really
believe in Jesus Christ, who really
love his religion as far as they know
it, who have real Christian piety, and
actually believe themselves to be
true Christians in faith and practice.
These, he contends, preserve to Protestantism
a certain religious and
Christian character, and will prevent
it from ever lapsing into complete unbelief
and irreligion. They will always
insist on some form of Christianity;
and whatever the form they
adopt, it will be Protestantism. He
may be right; but we think, in discussing
the future of Protestantism,
he makes too much account of these
pious persons; for if as well disposed
as he assumes them to be, they can
hardly fail, as time goes on and the
real character of the Reformation becomes
more and more manifest, to
follow out their Christian tendency,
and return to the communion of the
Catholic Church.</p>

<p>Looking at the two tendencies
among Protestants, studying them as
thoroughly as we are able, and considering
especially the essential nature
of Protestantism, together with what
we may call the logic of error&mdash;for error
as well as truth has its logic&mdash;we
think Protestantism as pretending to
be Christian will, as we have said,
finally disappear, and prove itself
practically, as it is logically, the total
rejection of the Christian religion, and
therefore of Christ himself. In point
of fact, Protestantism in its spirit and
essence, as the author shows beyond
contradiction, is only the revival under
a modern form of the great Gentile
Apostasy that followed the building
of the Tower of Babel, and must,
if it run its course, lapse either into
no-religion, as it has already done
with our modern scientists, or into
demon-worship and gross idolatry and
superstition, as it is actually doing
with modern spiritists right under our
eyes. We look, as we have already
intimated, for a separation of the
wheat from the chaff, and believe the
time will come when the real issue
will be made up, and the battle we
must wage be not with heresy, but
with undisguised and unmitigated infidelity,
rationalism, naturalism, or
pure secularism.</p>

<p>We cannot give a complete analysis
of the Abbé Martin's work; for it
is itself little else than an analysis.
But an interesting and important
portion of it is devoted to the Protestant
revival and propaganda, beginning
in the latter half of the last
century, and continued so vigorously
in the present. Protestantism, seeking
from the first the aid and protection
of the princes, soon assumed in
each country that adopted it the
form and state of a national religious
establishment, defended and governed
by the secular power. Having no
true spiritual life within, and defended
without and provided for by the government,
it fell, as soon as the religious
wars occasioned by its origin
had subsided, into a state of torpor,
and the people under it fell almost
universally into a religious somnolence.
The establishment was sustained
even with rigor, but personal
religion was generally unknown or
disregarded. Some individuals, seeing
this, applied themselves to awaken
in the torpid masses a personal interest
in religion. From them began a
religious revival, or a movement in
behalf of personal religion, known in
Germany as Pietism, in Great Britain
and elsewhere as Methodism, which
holds principally from John and
Charles Wesley, George Whitefield,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
and Lady Huntington. This revival,
which has done much to increase individualism,
and to weaken the influence
of dogma and church principles, and
which has developed a species of
evangelical illuminism resulting in a
sort of infidel illuminism, as seen in
our American transcendentalists and
free religionists, has, upon the whole,
the author thinks, injured more than
it has advanced Protestantism. Such,
we are sure, has been the fact in this
country, unless we identify Protestantism
with pure unbelief and indifference.
Not one fourth of those assumed
to be "hopefully converted"
in revival seasons stay converted,
while the backsliders are worse Christians,
and those who remain pious
are no better Protestants, than they
were before their conversion.</p>

<p>The revival has, however, given
birth to a vigorous propaganda in
pagan and Catholic countries, and
even in Protestant countries themselves,
by means of Bible societies,
tract societies, home and foreign missionary
societies, supported on a large
scale and with apparently inexhaustible
means. The author discusses
this Protestant propaganda in relation
to infidel nations; to mixed nations,
or nations composed of Protestants
and Catholics; and finally to
old Catholic nations. In infidel or
pagan nations he maintains that it
has thus far been null. He maintains
also that in all those Protestant
nations, or nations in which Protestantism
became the established
church, but in which some remnants
of the old Catholic population still
remained and adhered to the Catholic
faith and worship, the propaganda
has, upon the whole, proved a failure,
and in nearly all of them Catholicity
has gained, and is still gaining, on
Protestantism. This, counting from
the date of the institution of the Protestant
foreign and home missions
in the beginning of the present century,
is certainly true in Great Britain
and Ireland, in Holland, Switzerland,
especially in Sweden and Norway,
and in this country; though the principal
gains in England, Scotland, and
the United States are due to the immigration
of Catholics from countries
under Protestant governments,
or governments not friendly to the
church. In the United States we
are almost wholly indebted for the
astonishing growth of the church to
the migration hither of Catholics
from Ireland and Germany. We
have numerous conversions, indeed;
but they form hardly an appreciable
element in our entire Catholic population.
In the English-speaking
world there have been many conversions
from the upper classes and
from the ranks of the Protestant ministry,
especially of the Anglican and
Protestant Episcopal communions;
but very little impression is as yet
made on the middle and lower classes,
who must be converted before much
progress is made in the conversion of
a nation. We have certainly gained
ground in Protestant nations, but probably
not much more than we have
lost in old Catholic nations.</p>

<p>While the Protestant propaganda
has failed with infidel or pagan nations,
and with the Catholic populations
of Protestant nations, the author
maintains that, allied with rationalism
and the revolution, it has not been
wholly unsuccessful in old Catholic
nations, as France, Italy, Spain, Austria,
and Hungary. It is, he maintains,
"worse than idle" to pretend
that Protestant missions in these
nations are wholly barren of results,
or have met with only insignificant
success. Their success has been
considerable, not perhaps in making
Protestants, but in unmaking Catholics.
Their missions are generally
favored by the press, by the higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
literature, and by the governments,
which, even though nominally Catholic,
are always jealous of the
church, and ever encroaching on her
rights and restraining her freedom.</p>

<p>The success of the Protestant propaganda
in these old Catholic nations,
the author thinks, is due to the
reputation Protestant nations have
of surpassing Catholic nations in material
well-being; of having founded
civil and religious liberty; and
chiefly to the unpopularity of the
clergy, the supineness of Catholics,
and the ignorance of the Catholic
clergy of the real character
of contemporary Protestantism. All
these causes no doubt are operative;
but the real cause, we apprehend, is
to be sought in the ascendency acquired
by the world in the fifteenth
century, and which has invaded Catholic
nations hardly less successfully
than Protestant nations. Protestantism
is the child of this ascendency,
and its legitimate tendency is to place
the world above heaven, and man
above God; or the complete supremacy
of the secular over the spiritual.</p>

<p>In its origin Protestantism seemed
to be an exaggerated supernaturalism,
denying to the natural all moral
ability since the fall, and consequently
assigning to the human will no
active part in the work of justification
or sanctification. But extremes
meet; and the exaggerated supernaturalism
in relation to the world
to come proved to be only an exaggerated
naturalism in relation to this
world. To deny all activity of the
natural in the work of sanctity is only
emancipating the natural from the
supernatural, from the moral law,
and leaving it therefore free from all
moral accountability, to follow without
restraint its own inclinations and
tendencies; for what is incapable of
meriting is necessarily incapable of
sinning. As the affections of the natural
fasten on this world and the
goods of this life, Protestantism
soon lost practically all sense of the
divine, as it is now rapidly losing it
theoretically, and turned the whole
activity of the nations that embraced
it to the cultivation of the material
order and the acquisition of material
goods, leaving the spiritual order behind
as a popish superstition, or an
invention of priestcraft for enslaving
the soul and restraining the natural
freedom of mankind.</p>

<p>The spirit that generated and operates
in Protestantism, and which its
doctrine of free or sovereign grace
only fortifies, is, in fact, only the old
heathen spirit that seeks only the
goods of this life, and so pointedly
condemned by Christianity. It reverses
the word of our Lord, "Seek
first the kingdom of God and his justice,
and all these things shall be added
unto you;" and says, "Seek first
these things&mdash;the goods of this life&mdash;and
the kingdom of God and his justice
shall be added; if, indeed, such
kingdom or justice there be." This
spirit was not originated by the Reformation.
It had preceded it. It had
originated the great Gentile Apostasy,
and caused the carnal Jews to misinterpret
the prophecies and to expect
in the promised Messiah a temporal
prince instead of a spiritual redeemer
and regenerator. It had even entered
the garden and induced the fall of
our first parents. It has always subsisted
in the world; nay, is what St.
Augustine called the City of the
World as opposed to the City of God,
and which had its type and representative
in the Roman republic and
empire. It is the purely secular spirit
emancipated from the spiritual, and
substituting itself for it.</p>

<p>This spirit is everywhere warred
against by Christianity, therefore by
Catholicity; and during the temporal
calamities of the barbarous and middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
ages was held in check by the
church; but the advancement of
political and social order, the progress
of well-being, the revival of pagan
literature and art, the opening
of new or long disused routes of
commerce, and the discovery, in the
fifteenth century, of a new continent
with its untold treasures, gave new
force and activity to the pagan spirit,
and enabled it to pervade and take
possession of the governments, never
very submissive to the church, of the
emperor, of kings, princes, and nobles,
and, in general, of the upper
classes of European society. Christendom
was well prepared at the
opening of the sixteenth century
for a revival of Gentilism, which
found able and magnificent supporters
in the Medici of Florence, so
dear to modern uncatholic scholars,
but so fatal in their influence on Catholic
interests.</p>

<p>With the revival of Gentilism or
secularism there came the revival of
the quarrel of pagan times between
Germany and Rome; and Luther's
movement derived its chief strength
from its appeal to the old German
hatred of Roman domination, represented
in the fifteenth century, it was
assumed, in part by the pope, and in
part by the emperor, who pretended
to revive the old Roman empire and
to succeed to the Roman Cæsars of
the West. The Germanic nations,
never thoroughly Romanized, rebelled
against the church, not because
the secular spirit was more or less
rampant with them than with the
Romanic nations that remained Catholic,
but because the centre of her
authority was the old hated city of
Rome; and they looked upon her
authority as Roman, and incompatible
with their own national independence.
Nothing is farther from the
truth than to suppose that they were
moved by a desire to emancipate the
human mind from its pretended
thraldom under the pope, or to establish
free inquiry and the liberty of
private judgment; for they yielded
from the first to the secular or national
sovereign all the authority in spirituals
which had been previously exercised
by the Roman pontiff. Wherever
Protestantism gained a political status,
the two powers, as under paganism&mdash;unless
we except Geneva, Scotland,
and, subsequently, New England&mdash;were
united in the secular sovereign
or the state. Calvin in Geneva,
Knox in Scotland, and the Puritans in
New England, though they sought to
unite the two powers in the same
governing body, sought to unite them
in the hands of the church rather than
of the state, in consequence of their
misinterpretation of the Hebrew
commonwealth, which, in fact, gave
us the first example in history of the
separation of the two powers, the sacerdotal
and the secular, always asserted
and insisted on by the Catholic
Church.</p>

<p>The real character of the Protestant
movement was a movement in
behalf of nationalism&mdash;the distinctive
feature of Gentilism&mdash;revived by the
insurgent worldly spirit. The church
herself, in the nations that adhered to
her, was defended against the so-called
Reformation, except by the theologians,
not on Catholic principles, but
on national principles; and hence
the secular authority sought constantly
to exercise a supervision over the
church, and, as far as possible, to
convert her into a national church.
The so-called Catholic governments
did not differ in principle from the
Protestant governments, and have
never done so since. They protected
the church, to a certain extent,
from recognized heresies, and provided
for the pomp and splendor of her
worship; but restrained in every possible
way her full freedom of action,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
and compelled her to yield to their
respective national policies in order
to avoid a greater evil. The church
could not fully instruct the people in
any Catholic nation in the principles
which should govern the relations of
church and state without incurring
the persecution of her pretended protectors.
Hence, there grew up in all
Catholic nations a false view of those
relations, which greatly weakened the
church and aided the growth of the
secular spirit. Catholicity, having
been supported, not as Catholic but
as a national religion, by Catholic
governments and their courtiers, we
find now, when the governments
cease to defend it even as a national
religion, and are more hostile than
friendly to the church, that the Catholic
populations of old Catholic nations,
never allowed by the secular
authority to be fully instructed in the
secular relations of their religion, and
never accustomed to act personally
in the intellectual defence of their
faith, incrusted over with the secularism
encouraged by their governments,
are almost universally unarmed and
defenceless before the Protestant propaganda,
having in its favor the prestige
of the worldly power and supposed
well-being of Protestant nations,
and of the championship of
civil and religious liberty.</p>

<p>Here, we apprehend, is the real secret
of the success of Protestant missions
in old Catholic nations; not in
the ignorance of the Catholic clergy
of the real character of contemporary
Protestantism, as the Abbé Martin
maintains. He shows, perhaps exaggerates,
the danger which the church
runs in these old Catholic nations,
and admits that it is becoming apparent,
if not to all, at least to many of
the clergy, and asks,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"How could it be otherwise with the
French clergy, so learned, so pious, so vigilant,
and so zealous? They are preparing
themselves for the struggle; they proceed
to the battle with the energy of faith; they
lack not ability; but they <em>lack a knowledge
of contemporary Protestantism</em>. If they
would struggle with success, if they would
revive the glorious days of the Catholic
apologetic of the seventeenth century, or
rather, if they would create a new apologetic
in harmony with the wants and errors of
the times, they must study Protestantism
in its latest evolutions and in its actual
physiognomy." (Pp. 178, 179.)</p></blockquote>

<p>No doubt there is more or less
ignorance even among the French
clergy as to the various phases and
wiles of Protestantism, and which
their text-books will hardly help
them to dissipate; but what seems
to us to stand most in their way is
precisely their need of studying Catholic
theology more thoroughly in
its relations to human reason and
the secular order&mdash;a study they
could hardly prosecute under what
are facetiously termed "the Gallican
liberties;" that is, liberties of the
government to enslave the church.
No man who has learned Catholic
theology as catholic instead of national,
who has learned that the church
represents on earth the spiritual order,
and has the freedom and courage
to maintain that the spiritual is superior
to the temporal, is, in fact, the
end for which the temporal exists,
and therefore that which prescribes to
the temporal its law, can ever be at
a loss to understand or to know how
to meet Protestantism the moment he
sees it, whatever the particular phase
it may exhibit. Protestantism is not
and never was any thing but a series
of negations, and all the advantage it
has ever had or ever will have over
Catholics is precisely in their ignorance
of the real or intrinsic relation
of the Catholic doctrine or doctrines
it denies to the whole body of Catholic
truth.</p>

<p>Protestantism, the author himself
sees, is simply revived paganism; but
what he does not see is, that the state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
in all European nations has always
been pagan, and never in its principle
or constitution been truly Christian.
Our own political constitution
may be very imperfect, may be destined
to a speedy end; but it is the
first and only instance in history of a
political constitution based on Christian
principles; that is, on the recognition
of the independence of religion
and the supremacy of the spiritual
order. It recognizes, in our modern
phrase, the inalienable rights of man
as its basis; but what the American
statesman calls the rights of man are,
in reality, the rights of God, which
every human authority must hold sacred
and inviolable. We pretend not
that the American people or American
statesmen fully understand or adhere
practically to the American constitution,
or that they ever will till
they become Catholics and understand,
as comparatively few Catholics
even now do, the principles of their
church in their political and social
applications. Nevertheless, the constitution
is based on the independence
and supremacy of the spiritual order,
which the secular order must always
and everywhere recognize, respect,
and defend. This is in direct contradiction
of the principle of the pagan
republic, which asserts the independence
and supremacy of the state alike
in temporals and spirituals.</p>

<p>But this pagan principle of the supremacy
of the state has always been
the basis of the European public law,
and the church, though she has always
maintained the contrary, has always
been held in the civil jurisprudence
to have only the rights accorded
her by the civil government. This
has always been the doctrine alike of
the Civil Law and the Common Law
courts, always rigidly enforced by
the French parliaments, and not seldom
yielded by courtly prelates afraid,
as in England, of the statute of <i>præmunire</i>.
There have been individual
sovereigns who personally understood
and yielded the church her rights;
but their lawyers never recognized
them save as grants or concessions
by the prince. Hence the interminable
quarrel of the legists and the
canonists, and the sad spectacle of the
bishops of a nation not seldom deserting
almost in a body the supreme
pontiff in his deadly struggle with
their civil tyrants in defence of their
own rights, and the freedom and
independence of the spiritual order.
Hence, too, we see Italian statesmen,
while pretending to acknowledge and
confirm religious liberty, confiscating
the goods of the church, and prescribing
in the name of the state the conditions
on which the bishops of the
church will be permitted to exercise
their pastoral functions. Hence it is,
also, that we have seen pious and devout
Catholics defend the revolution
and preach political atheism in one
breath, and the most rigid orthodoxy
in another.</p>

<p>With all deference to M. l'Abbé
Martin, we must think that what is
wanting in the Catholic populations
of old Catholic countries in order to
resist the Protestant propaganda, is
not so much a better knowledge of
Protestantism, as a more thorough
knowledge of their own faith, and
of Catholic principles themselves, in
relation to one another and to the
secular order&mdash;a knowledge which has
been hindered, and to a great extent
prevented, by the paganism of the
state, which has disabled the church
from freely and fully giving it. Happily,
the European governments by
ceasing to be protectors of the church
have in great measure lost the power,
if not to afflict and persecute, at
least to enslave her. The bishops,
with only here and there an exception,
no longer take the side of Cæsar
against Peter, and see that their interests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
and those of the church can
be saved only by the strictest union
with and submission to the supreme
pastor, the vicar of Christ. The supreme
pastor himself, without consulting
earthly potentates or conferring
with flesh and blood, has pronounced
in his Encyclical and Syllabus,
a rigorous judgment on political
atheism and paganism in modern society,
and set forth the Catholic principles
in which the faithful need to
be instructed in order to resist the
Protestant propaganda, supported by
rationalism and the revolution. He
has asserted the independence and
freedom of the church in convoking
by his own authority, almost in defiance
of the secular powers, an &oelig;cumenical
council, to be held in his own
palace of the Vatican, in which the
universal church, aided by the Holy
Ghost, will, we presume, deliberate
and pronounce upon the errors of
the times, and indicate the means of
arresting the evils that now so grievously
afflict society, both spiritual and
secular. Hereafter, we may hope,
the faithful, cost what it may, will be
more thoroughly instructed as to the
relations of the two powers, and of faith
to reason and civil society, so that an
end will be put to the progress in
Catholic nations of Protestantism, rationalism,
and political atheism.</p>

<p>The Abbé Martin succeeds better in
describing Protestantism as it is, and in
setting forth the danger it threatens,
than in pointing out the remedy to be
applied by Catholics, or in assigning
the causes of the defects he finds or
thinks he finds among them. He does
not see that these defects, in so far
as general, are almost wholly due to
the pagan constitution of the state,
which has survived the downfall of
pagan Rome, and to the fact that
the church has never yet in the Old
World had her full freedom and independence,
but has always been more
or less restrained in her action by the
jealousy or hostility of the state.
The lack of individual energy and
self-reliance of Catholics in asserting
and defending the rights of the church,
which the abbé deplores, has its origin
in the restraint imposed by the
civil authority on the freedom of the
church.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Catholics," he says, "relying on authority,
full of confidence in its unfailing
promises, are quite ready to think that it is
enough for them to preserve the faith in
their hearts, and to perform its works, while
the defence and preservation of the church
is the care of Providence. This sentiment,
very commendable, no doubt, is yet, when
not joined to a masculine energy which
counts no sacrifices, if needed, in sustaining
the work of God, only an enervating sloth.
Catholics&mdash;may I say it?&mdash;need the activity
of individual forces, not, indeed, of that excessive
individualism which, puffed up by
pride, drives the Protestant over the dark
waves of doubt, but that Christian individualism
which, accepting by conviction the
compass of authority, knows how to employ
all its personal forces in its service.
This individualism, Protestants reproach us
with lacking; let us prove to them the contrary,
and show that individual action is
quite as powerful and far more productive,
when it is well balanced, measured, and
subjected to wise rules, as when it wanders
without law or discipline, and acts only under
the varying impulses of free inquiry.
It is, moreover, necessary to enter into this
way; for the time has come for Catholics to
understand that they can henceforth nowhere
on earth count on any support but
from God and themselves." (Pp. 175, 176.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The author adds that Catholics,
not only nominal but even many
practical Catholics, lack the individual
energy that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"springs from profound faith, the faith
which goes to the marrow, and enters even
the centre of the soul, and radiates from it
in earnest convictions over all religious practices,
over the entire life, giving to them
their true sense and to it the right direction
and end. Protestants accuse our church of
materialism in her worship....</p>

<p>"The charge is false when applied to the
church and her worship, but is only too
true when applied to her members. Hence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
the painful inconsistencies in their conduct.
They are Catholics in the church, Catholics
in essential religious practices, sometimes
even in works of supererogation, but are
elsewhere and in other matters hardly
Christians. The <i>petit devotion</i> is sterile;
manly, robust piety alone is productive, and
it is it alone that we must labor to diffuse.
We should seek to make it enter into souls
and become fused with their very substance.
Catholic worship is the most admirable vehicle
of the spirit of life; but souls must
comprehend it, and be instructed to draw
the spirit of life from it." (Pp. 176, 177.)</p></blockquote>

<p>There is no doubt truth in this,
and with but too many Catholics their
religion is little more in practice than
a lifeless form; but this, so far as due
to the clergy, is due rather to their
want of earnestness and zeal, which
the author says they do not lack, than
to their ignorance of contemporary
Protestantism. We pay little heed
to the reproaches of Protestants,
more likely to mislead than to instruct
Catholics; but we are quite willing
to concede that in old Catholic nations
there may be a want among
Catholics of the sort of individual
energy defined and demanded by
the author; but, in the first place,
we are disposed to think that his
long study of Protestantism, which
is based on individualism, and his
observation of the part played by
what Protestants call personal religion,
have led him to overrate the importance
of this outward individual
zeal and energy in the church; and
in the second place, he seems not to
have sufficiently considered that they
can hardly be looked for in a community
accustomed for ages to rely
on the civil power to look out for
the defence of the church, and for her
protection against heretics and heresies.
In such communities the free
action of the church has been crippled
by the attempt of the state to
do her work and only bungling it, and
in which no call for personal effort
in preserving and defending the
church externally has been made on
Catholics as individuals. The evil
results naturally from the condition
in which Catholics must be found
when abandoned by the government
that had hitherto saved them from all
necessity of any personal activity in
their own defence against external
enemies. It can be only temporary,
if the church is left henceforth
free by the government to appeal to
the individual faith, love, and exertions
of the faithful under her direction.</p>

<p>There is, no doubt, much tepidity,
formalism, and momentary imbecility
in the face of the enemy in old Catholic
populations; for not the just
nor the elect only are members of
the church; but abandoned or opposed
as the church now is by the
governments, and thrown back as
she is everywhere upon her own resources
as a spiritual kingdom, forced
to be even in old Catholic nations
once more a missionary church in
every thing except in outward form,
and obliged to appeal directly to the
faithful individually, there can hardly
fail to be developed in Catholics the
personal qualities which the author
thinks they do not now possess. The
need of a robust and manly piety to
struggle with the world and the enemies
of the church will very soon
call it forth, where religion is free
and faith is not extinct.</p>

<p>We cannot but think, if the author
had experienced the vexations and
annoyances that we have from the
personal and individual zeal and activity
of Protestants of the revival
stamp, each one of whom acts as if
he were an Atlas and bore the whole
weight of the religious world on his
individual shoulders, he would much
prefer its absence among Catholics to
its presence. Not more troublesome
were the frogs of Egypt, that came
up into the kneading-troughs and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
sleeping-chambers. It is not easy to
describe the sensation of relief a convert
from Protestantism feels on coming
into the church and learning that
he has now a religion that can
sustain him instead of needing him
to sustain it. With Protestants, the
member bears the sect; with Catholics,
the church bears the member.
The sacraments are effective <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex opere
operato</i>. We are disposed, moreover,
to believe that Catholics best
serve the Catholic cause by each
one's doing in his own sphere his
own allotted work. The unity of
faith, and the unity of the spirit that
works alike in all the faithful to will
and to do, are sufficient to secure
unity of action, and action to one and
the same end, and to effect with marvellous
rapidity the grandest and
most magnificent results. This, we
think, is the Catholic method, quiet,
peaceable, orderly, and, if less showy
and striking than the Protestant method,
less noisy and prosy, far more
fruitful in results. The Catholic is
sustained, the Protestant must sustain.</p>

<p>For our part, we are grateful to
the author for his masterly exposition
of contemporary Protestantism; but
we hope we may be permitted to say
that, while we do not deny the danger
with which it threatens the populations
of old Catholic nations, we
think he exaggerates it, and supposes
Protestant negations are more powerful
than they really are. It may be
that the Catholic populations are not
at present very well prepared to withstand
the Protestant propaganda, allied
as it is with rationalism and the
revolution; but they cannot long
remain unprepared. The revolution
having, wherever attempted, resulted
in the loss of old liberties without
the acquisition of any additional civil
freedom, must gradually lose its credit
with the people, who must ere
long be disillusioned; rationalism is
too cold, too absurd, and too destitute
of life to hold them in permanent
subjection. Scientists and sciolists
may adhere to it while its
novelty lasts, but both the reason
and instincts of the people reject it,
and demand faith, religion. Protestantism
severed from the revolution
and rationalism is too much what
the great Catholic controversialists
met in the seventeenth century and
vanquished for its revival to be able
to gain and hold much new territory.</p>

<p>The real danger, in our judgment,
is in the spread of secularism or the
secular spirit among Catholics themselves.
This is the only serious obstacle
we see to the conversion of the
American people to the church. Catholics
here and elsewhere conform
to modern civilization, and are carried
away by its spirit. They follow
the spirit of the age without knowing
it; and though a Catholic may accept
without scruple all the positive results
of what is called modern civilization,
he cannot imbibe and follow its spirit
without great loss on the side of
religion, which requires the renunciation
of the world as the end for
which one is to live and to labor.
But there are even among Catholics
very worthy men, men of excellent
parts and rare learning, who virtually
subordinate the spiritual to the secular.
They have so far yielded to the
secular spirit of the day as to place
the defence of the church on secular
rather than on spiritual grounds, and
defend her claims as the church of
God rather as necessary to secure
civil liberty and advanced civilization
than as necessary to save the soul
and secure the beatitude of heaven.
They are, in some degree, affected by
the philanthropy or humanitarianism
of the age, and occasionally confound
it with Christian charity, which loves
God supremely, and our neighbor as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
ourselves in God, or for the sake of
God.</p>

<p>These men pursue a line of argument
that draws off the Catholic
mind from the kingdom of God and
his justice, and fixes it on those
things after which the heathen seek,
secularize it, and lead it to think that
our Lord's mission had for its object
the multiplication of earthly
goods and securing earthly felicity.
They unintentionally play into the
hands of radicals and revolutionists,
by influencing Catholics to strive after
social instead of spiritual progress,
and making them feel that the great
work for the church is less to train
men for heaven than to make the
earth a more pleasant abode for them;
or that the proper way for men to
work out their salvation hereafter is to
work earnestly and perseveringly for
the progress of civil and political liberty,
and the reform of political and
social abuses. It can hardly have
any but a bad influence on the Catholic
mind to find prominent Catholics
urging their Catholic fellow-citizens
to make common cause with
the most notorious and irreligious infidel
and radical leaders of the revolution,
as if there could be any thing
in common between Catholics and
men who demand liberty only to
emancipate themselves from the divine
law and to suppress the church,
or at least to restrain her freedom.</p>

<p>But we are forgetting our author.
Of the three causes he assigns for the
partial success in old Catholic nations
of Protestant missions, we have
considered only the third and last&mdash;the
alleged ignorance of the clergy
of contemporary Protestantism, the
supineness of Catholics, and their
lack of individual zeal, energy, and
self-reliance. We have ventured to
differ in some respects with regard to
this alleged cause from the eminent
author, and to take a deeper and a
broader view of the real cause of
Protestant success. We have traced
it to the ascendency of the worldly
spirit which has given birth to Protestantism
itself, and, even in Catholic
countries, deprived the church of her
rightful freedom of action. We see
the cause in the false relations of
church and state that have hitherto
subsisted in Christian nations, in the
oppression and restraint of the church
by the state. The other two causes,
the impression that Protestant nations
surpass Catholic nations in material
wealth and well-being, and that Protestantism
has founded and sustains
civil and religious liberty, we must reluctantly
reserve for a future article.</p>

<h2>HURSTON HALL.</h2>


<p>The great avenue of Hurston was
all aglow with the golden sunset.
Stray beams trembled among the
shadows of the massive oaks, bathed
the stone terrace in a flood of
crimson radiance, and lingered lovingly
among the quaint parterres,
where all day long they had given
life and beauty to the flowers. The
"parting smile of day" illumined lawn
and garden, mellowed the rugged
outlines of the ancient hall, and
threw over its gloomy grandeur a
golden mist that seemed to spiritualize
it.</p>

<p>But more brightly and lovingly
than elsewhere it rested on the fair
brow and golden curls of young
Lord Hurston, as, reclining on his
couch with his face turned to the
sunset, he watched with boyish delight
the beauty of the scene.</p>

<p>"Close the book, Aunt Caddy,"
he said, turning to a pale, graceful
lady, who, seated on an ottoman beside
him, had been reading to the
young invalid the most beautiful of
the great poet's <i>Idylls</i>. "Close the
book; for you are tired, and I want
you to look at the sunset and talk to
me. Isn't it beautiful? See that
great oak at the bend of the avenue!
Every leaf seems woven with gold.
I wonder if that little squirrel has his
nest among the roots yet. What a
pile of nuts I found there long ago,
before I was sick! I wonder if I
will ever be well enough to hunt
squirrels again?" And the little speaker
sighed as he turned restlessly on
his couch.</p>

<p>"I hope so, darling," Aunt Caddy
replied fondly. "But we must be
patient, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. But it is hard
sometimes&mdash;only sometimes&mdash;Aunt
Caddy; for boys are not like girls;
<em>they</em> might lie still and not care so
much. But when Lady Rayburn
and Percy and George were here,
and I saw how the boys could climb
and ride and jump; and when I had
Floy brought out from the stable for
them and I heard her call me just
as she used when I could ride&mdash;I
wouldn't tell any one but you&mdash;but
O Aunt Caddy! I cried when I
was all by myself&mdash;cried like a great
baby girl."</p>

<p>Aunt Caddy's eyes were bright
with tears of pity.</p>

<p>"My poor pet! was it so hard for
you? Then grandmamma will not
ask them here again."</p>

<p>"No, no! dear auntie; that would
never do. I am not such a coward
as to mind feeling badly; and then, I
would bear it better next time. No,
no! Hurston Hall must be open to
every one, as it was in grandpapa's
time, as it would be if papa had lived,
even though its lord is only a sick
boy who can but lie on his cushions
and let his guests amuse themselves
as they please. Only I wish I were
as good and patient as you would
be in my place. You are just like
Elaine. If you were grieved or sorrowful,
no one would ever know it.
You would only grow pale and quiet
and silent, until some morning you
would float away from us over the
dark waters with the story of your
sorrow folded over your still heart."</p>

<p>The crimson glow of sunset seemed
to flush Aunt Caddy's cheek as
she bent to kiss the pale, little, earnest
face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are a poet yourself, Arthur.
Who knows but that you may prove
a second Sir Philip Sidney. We
have had so many bold barons of
Hurston that Sir Arthur may well
afford to win gentler fame and more
peaceful laurels."</p>

<p>The boy was silent for a moment;
then replied with touching seriousness,</p>

<p>"Auntie, dear, you are all kind and
loving to me; but you try to deceive
me. I saw Doctor Woodley's face
when he sounded my lungs the other
day, and I know what it meant.
Poor papa did not live to be twenty-four;
and I&mdash;I was reading a book
the other day, and I saw in it the
sentence, 'Born to die.' It seemed
as if it were written for me&mdash;born
to die, not to live and win laurels,
Aunt Caddy."</p>

<p>"My darling, you must not talk
so! Think of poor grandmamma,
think of us all if we should lose you.
You are only twelve, and youth
can hope for every thing."</p>

<p>But even as she spoke a flood of
memories welled up from her heart;
sweet yet mournful voices of the past,
whispering sadly of <em>her</em> youth&mdash;its
vanished hopes, its faded dreams.
The sunset radiance had paled now,
and dim shadows were gathering
over the rosy, western horizon as
Aunt Caddy thought of her life, with
its early sunset, its shadowy twilight,
that would be so cheerless did not the
starry gleam of other worlds sometimes
pierce the gloom.</p>

<p>But Arthur's voice aroused her
from her reverie.</p>

<p>"I don't think it seems so dreadful
now to die, Aunt Caddy. When
I was well and strong, it seemed so;
and I used almost to shiver when I
passed the tomb where poor papa
and mamma lie side by side, beneath
the painted window in the chancel.
It seemed so hard that he should not
live long enough to bear the title.
But now I sometimes lie awake at
night and think how strange it will
look to see beside grandpapa's monument
that tells how very, very old he
was, another with a broken column, or
something like that, and the inscription,
<i>Arthur, seventeenth baron of
Hurston, aged twelve</i>, or <i>thirteen</i>&mdash;not
any more I think, auntie."</p>

<p>"My darling, my darling, these
morbid fancies grieve me sadly."</p>

<p>"I don't want to grieve you, Aunt
Caddy; but why should we fear to
talk of what must be? I will leave
you here in my place&mdash;you and
grandmamma. You will be the lady
of the hall, and help the poor people
around, and keep the old place from
getting ruined and desolate; and
make Johnson spare those oaks that
he wanted to cut down; grandpapa's
oaks must not be touched. O
Aunt Caddy! you will always stay
at Hurston, even when I am gone,
won't you?" And the earnest eyes
pleaded eloquently.</p>

<p>"Your Uncle Charles would be
the owner of Hurston, my darling,"
was the low reply. "He would live
here or send some one in his place.
Grandmamma and I would have a
right here no longer. So you must
get well and strong, if you want to
keep us at Hurston," she added with
an attempt at playfulness.</p>

<p>"My Uncle Charles!" said the
young lord in amazement. "Why
must he come here? Where is he
now? Why should he be owner of
Hurston?"</p>

<p>"He is next heir&mdash;your father's
younger brother; he has been with
his regiment in Canada for a great
many years," she replied hurriedly.
"But do not let us talk of sad fancies
any longer. You will be strong as
Cousin Percy in the spring, and will
ride Floy as gayly as ever."</p>

<p>"But I want to hear about my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
Uncle Charles," said Arthur eagerly.
"Did I ever see him?"</p>

<p>"When you were a little baby, perhaps.
He has been in America ten
years."</p>

<p>"Did <em>you</em> ever see him, Aunt
Caddy?"</p>

<p>"Very often, dear," was the low
reply.</p>

<p>"But why does he not come to
England? Why did not grandpapa
hear from him?" continued the eager
little questioner.</p>

<p>"My dearest, you are too young
to weary yourself with others' troubles.
Your grandfather and his
younger son parted in anger. They
were both proud and passionate, and
neither would forgive or yield; and
now death has come between them,"
Aunt Caddy said sadly.</p>

<p>"And would he come to Hurston
if I should die?"</p>

<p>"I scarcely think so, dear; he has
few pleasant memories connected
with it."</p>

<p>"Then you would stay, dear
auntie?"</p>

<p>"No, dearest, I could not," she replied
with deepening color. "When
my sister wrote to your grandma
and to me that she was dying, and
we must take her place to her orphaned
boy; when your grandfather,
old Lord Hurston, placed you in my
arms, then Hurston Hall became our
home; but when Colonel Charles
Thornbury is its master, it ceases to
be so."</p>

<p>"How old is my uncle, Aunt
Caddy?"</p>

<p>"Thirty-one, I think, Arthur."</p>

<p>"Thirty-one," was the thoughtful
reply. "And he will be Lord Hurston
when I die. I wish I knew him,
Aunt Caddy. Do you think he would
come to England if you wrote him?
You knew him, auntie. I want
to see him; I want to ask him not
to leave Hurston to ruin and desolation;
I want to ask him to let you
stay and take care of the dear old
place that grandpa was so proud of.
I want to ask him not to let Johnson
cut down the oaks that he wanted to
thin out last fall. Dear, dear Aunt
Caddy, won't you write for me?"
pleaded the earnest little speaker.</p>

<p>"My darling Arthur," she replied
with a deepening blush that freshened
her pale face wonderfully, "I cannot.
It&mdash;it&mdash;would be impossible."</p>

<p>"But <em>why</em>, Aunt Caddy?" continued
the persevering boy. "Is he so
very bad, so wicked, that you never
speak? Is my uncle a bad man,
Aunt Caddy? Has he"&mdash;and the
boy's cheek flushed with the pride of
his noble race&mdash;"has he disgraced us
in any way?"</p>

<p>"My dear Arthur," was the hurried
response, "oh! no; a thousand
times no! Your uncle was
proud, passionate, headstrong; but
he was&mdash;he is, I am sure, all that is
noble, brave, generous; and, Arthur,
he loved your father as fondly as
brothers could love."</p>

<p>"But why did he go away? Why
do we not hear from him?"</p>

<p>"My darling," the words came reluctantly,
"your grandpapa&mdash;in short,
they had some disagreement when
your uncle came of age about&mdash;about
a marriage that the old lord had
set his heart upon. But your uncle
was unwilling; that is&mdash;the lady was
rich, and he feared he would be
thought mercenary&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;we
must speak reverently of the dead,
dear Arthur," and she bent to kiss
his pale, pure brow; "but your uncle
was not to blame. Let us talk no
more about it now. See, the moon
is rising. Look how large and beautiful
it is! Have you no sonnet for
such a scene, my gentle troubadour?"</p>

<p>But Arthur was not to be deceived.
Spite of the gathering twilight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
he could see the large tears brimming
Aunt Caddy's still beautiful eyes;
could hear the tremor in her playful
tone; could feel, boy as he was,
that some chord had been touched
that thrilled with saddening memories.</p>

<p>The boy baron almost idolized the
fair, gentle aunt who had replaced to
him the mother he had never known,
and it was with a remorseful sympathy
that he flung his arms around
her neck, kissed her flushed cheek,
and whispered fondly, "Your tiresome
little troubadour knows but
one, and that is for you alone, dear
auntie&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je t'aime, je t'aime</i>; yes,
more than any one in the world, dear
Aunt Caddy."</p>

<p>He was not prepared for the long,
low sob that shook her slight frame
as she replied, in trembling accents,</p>

<p>"I believe you, my darling, my
own Arthur; the one sunbeam of a
cheerless&mdash;but never let us talk again
as we have done to-night."</p>

<p>So Arthur was silent; but with a
strange, precocious wisdom he "pondered
these things in his heart."</p>

<p>And the result was that a letter,
indited in a clear, boyish hand, sped
like a white-winged messenger of
peace across the broad Atlantic, bearing
the address of Colonel Charles
Thornbury, &mdash;th Dragoons.</p>

<p>And months after that twilight talk,
when the leaves of Hurston Park fell
in showers of crimson and gold on
the broad avenue, when the last roses
breathed their sweet farewells around
Arthur's latticed window, and the autumn
winds began to sigh through
the leafless vines, far away beneath
the clear blue sky of another hemisphere
a bronzed, bearded man read
those frank, boyish words of welcome
that bore the proud seal of his ancient
race, and, with a tear and a
smile, whispered a blessing on "<i>Arthur's
boy</i>."</p>

<p>Christmas snow lay white and pure
on the fields and groves of Hurston,
and Christmas moonlight fell like a
benediction on the spotless earth.
The old hall stood boldly out with
every rugged outline clearly defined
against the frosty winter sky. A
strange, irregular old pile, with little
architectural symmetry; for it had
grown with the fortunes of the race
that had ruled there for generations,
dating its foundation far back in the
mist of centuries before England bent
to Norman William's sceptre. Tradition
pointed to the grove where
the mistletoe was culled with many
a sacred rite; to the tower where
the fair bride waited and watched in
vain for her lord, who lay cold and
stiff on the lost battle plain of Hastings;
to the gate whence issued the
stout Baron of Hurston, stern in his
demand for right, to the rendezvous
at Runnymede. The long, low building
stretching into the shadows of
the grove was said to have been
built by Ethwold the Saxon, when,
weary of the toils of war, he retired into
the quiet "Hurst," beneath whose
leafy shelter his race grew and flourished
for generations.</p>

<p>Remnants of fearful tales still were
heard around the cottage fires&mdash;tales
of awful orgies held by the fierce
Saxon, and of invocations of Woden
and Thor, and rude banquets when
the wild chant of the bard and the
pledge of Waeshael echoed through
the ancient Hurst. It was even
whispered that these fierce, unbaptized
spirits still lingered around their
earthly haunts, watching the fortunes
of their race and guarding it from
extinction.</p>

<p>But the young Baron of Hurston
resting in his dainty sick-chamber,
surrounded by all that wealth and affection
could bestow, yet feeling with
a strange, peaceful resignation that
his young life was fast ebbing away,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
bestowed little thought on the name
and fame of the proud ancestors that
had ruled Hurston before him.</p>

<p>"I can do nothing, Aunt Caddy,"
he said with gentle sadness; "nothing
great, noble, glorious; I am only
a sick, helpless boy. But for the little
while I am with them, I would like
my people to be happy. I would like
every heart to be light and free that
I can render so. I will never live to
add any thing to the lustre of the
old name, never win fame or laurels
in camp or court. Only I would like,
when I am gone, to have it said that
Sir Arthur, their boy-lord's rule was
a light and happy one. So don't let me
hear any more of unpaid rents, Johnson,"
he would add, smiling merrily
at the faithful steward. "What do
I want with poor Farmer Cropper's
few guineas? Let my heir attend to
all such matters, if he will; no one
must be troubled while I can prevent
it."</p>

<p>They had learned ere this not to
be astonished at these strange, unchild-like
speeches, and all tried to
carry out their young lord's wishes
with almost worshipping fondness and
devotion.</p>

<p>So it happened that this Christmas
the old Saxon hall was decked gayly
with holly and ivy; mistletoe boughs
hung temptingly from the dark old
rafters, and the oaken floor was polished
till it shone again.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur had determined that the
servants' ball this year should be an
unprecedented success; and he himself&mdash;"blessings
on his sweet young
face," as the good old housekeeper
said when she announced the great
event&mdash;was "to be present in person."</p>

<p>Scores of wax lights winked merrily
between the heavy wreaths of ivy,
and a yule log, parent of a hundred
oaks, blazed like a royal bonfire on
the spacious hearth.</p>

<p>Already the old fiddler, blind of
one eye, and the old harpist, lame of
one leg&mdash;a pair of musicians whom
Sir Arthur patronized extensively, had
taken their places; already many
a bright eye and nimble foot danced
expectant, and many a rosy
cheek flushed deeper with anticipated
pleasure. Stately Lady Nesbitt,
Arthur's grandmother, was there, smiling
benignantly; Aunt Caddy&mdash;or the
"sweet Lady Caroline," as some of
her devoted pensioners called her&mdash;with
her Madonna face, waving hair,
and soft silvery robe, looking like
some gentle moonlight spirit; and
Arthur, his fair cheek flushed&mdash;ah!
too brightly&mdash;his golden ringlets, soft
as a maiden's, clustering on his pale
white brow, his clear blue eyes radiant
with pleasure, sat looking on, the
happiest baron of Hurston that ever
reigned in that grim abode.</p>

<p>Old Johnson, the steward and master
of ceremonies, alone was wanting;
and the impatient dancers began to
grow restless awaiting his signal to
open the ball. "Where <em>can</em> Johnson
be?" questioned Arthur for the
twentieth time; when the door suddenly
burst open, and Johnson appeared,
not a vestige of color in his
usually ruddy face, and every white
hair on his aged crown bristling with
terror.</p>

<p>"Great heavens!&mdash;I beg pardon,
my lord and ladies," panted the old
man breathlessly. "But I've seen him
at last! The Lord forgive me! I'll
never doubt that there be spirits return
again. I saw him with these very
eyes&mdash;the master, old Sir Ralph himself.
O my poor blessed lamb! I beg
pardon, my lord&mdash;Sir Arthur, I mean.
I hope this portends nothing awful."
And the faithful old servitor wiped
the great beads of moisture from his
brow.</p>

<p>"What <em>do</em> you mean, Johnson?
What has terrified you?" asked Lady
Nesbitt, calming in her stately way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
the excited group that had gathered
around her.</p>

<p>"This, madam&mdash;simply this, my
lady," replied the terrified old man.
"I was in the chapel, putting the
last wreath on Lady Edith's, my young
lord's blessed mother's tomb, when I
felt a sort of cold chill creep over
me, and says I to myself, 'It's only
the dampness'&mdash;for I have the rheumatics
occasionally, as my Lady Caroline
well knows. So says I, 'It's
only the dampness;' for I never believed
the stories the country folk tell
about the barons of Hurston leaving
their holy graves to walk on earth
again. And so I was walking slowly
out, when I heard a sort of groan,
and I turned, and, O my lord and
ladies! sure as the Lord sees me here,
I saw old Sir Ralph, our young lord's
grandfather, standing beside his own
tomb, with his head bent down and
his arms folded, as I've seen him over
and over again in life. O my dear
young lord! I couldn't be mistaken;
it's he himself and no other. I could
take my Bible oath to his back and
legs; begging your pardon, ladies, I
could indeed." And poor Johnson
paused for breath.</p>

<p>It was Arthur's clear tone that
broke the silence. "If it be my
grandfather," he said with that reverence
that pure young minds feel
for the unseen, "it is my place to go
and speak to him; he has returned
from the other world for some good
purpose, and I will speak to him."</p>

<p>"O my blessed lamb!&mdash;my dear
young lord, I mean," cried poor
Johnson in a fresh fit of terror; "don't,
for heaven's sake; don't go near him!
I am only afraid," and the faithful
old man fairly sobbed, "it is to take
you away that he has come."</p>

<p>"Yes," and though the boy's cheek
grew pale, his voice was firm, "it
is my place to go. Aunt Caddy," he
whispered, "he died, you know, without
having forgiven my uncle."</p>

<p>"Arthur, my dear, this is nonsense!"
began Lady Nesbitt nervously.</p>

<p>"Grandmamma, I must go," was
the firm reply.</p>

<p>"Come then, Arthur," said Lady
Caroline in a low voice; "for it is my
place as well as yours, to hear the
message of peace and forgiveness."</p>

<p>"My lord, my lord!" pleaded the
terrified servants. But he had gone.
With his little, thin hand clasped in
Aunt Caddy's, he ascended the winding
stone staircase that led to the chapel.</p>

<p>The lords of Hurston had adhered
through poverty, change, and persecution
to the ancient faith, and worshipped
for centuries beneath their own
roof.</p>

<p>The chapel of Hurston was rich
with quaint carving and mediæval ornament.
Six graceful columns supported
the Gothic roof, each column
bearing tablets to the memory of the
lords of Hurston who slept beneath.
Old Sir Ralph's tomb lay in the shadow
of the altar, while that of Arthur's
parents&mdash;a snow-white shaft
supporting a broken pillar&mdash;stood in
the full light of the chancel window,
whose richly-colored panes bore witness
to the virtues of the early dead
who slept beneath. Lady Caroline
felt Arthur's hand tremble, and she
herself grew pale with awe; for there
indeed, in the bright moonlight that
streamed through the painted window&mdash;there,
close to the tomb of old
Sir Ralph, in the shadow of the altar,
there stood a form with bowed head
and folded arms, a form that Arthur's
silver, trembling voice called "Grandfather!"</p>

<p>"Grandfather!" and the boy with
his pale face and golden curls
looked in the falling moonlight like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
seraph. "Grandfather, speak to me!
What is it that you wish of me?
Speak, dear grandfather! It is your
little Arthur; he does not fear you.
Grandfather," and his voice grew
lower and more musical, "is it the
thought of my uncle that disturbs
your rest? I will tell him that he is
forgiven; that you sent him the angels'
Christmas greeting&mdash;'<i>Peace on
earth to men of good-will</i>&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"My brave, my saintly boy! Arthur's
boy!" sobbed a deep, manly
voice; and the young lord found
himself clasped in a warm, living, loving
embrace, while a bronzed, bearded
face with great luminous dark eyes
looked almost reverently into his.</p>

<p>"Nephew, you have done what I
believed no mortal could do. You
have brought tears into Charles
Thornbury's eyes, and peace into his
heart!"</p>

<p>"O Aunt Caddy, Aunt Caddy!"
cried Arthur joyfully; "speak to him.
It is Uncle Charles; dear Uncle
Charles, that I wrote to so long ago!"</p>

<p>Aunt Caddy was pale and speechless
as the marble shaft against which
she leaned for support; but Colonel
Thornbury had a more potent spell.
"Caroline!"&mdash;the low whisper brought
a flush to cheek and brow&mdash;"Caroline,
my long lost love, whose tender
heart I wounded so deeply, can you
too join your voice to this angel
boy's, and whisper peace? Caroline,
I was mad with wounded pride and
jealous love&mdash;love that scorned the
thought of gain, that snapped every
tie when they said it was for your
wealth I sought you. God forgive
me! I cast the words back in their
teeth, and swore I would roam the
world a penniless adventurer rather
than be enriched by my wife. Caroline,
if my sin was great, my punishment
has been bitter. Ten years; ten
long, weary, loveless years! Arthur
has welcomed me with the voice of
peace. Have you no Christmas gift
for the penitent wanderer? None for
the faithful heart that has ever been
yours alone?" Lady Caroline was
pale again; but a radiance fairer than
moonlight seemed to light up her
brow.</p>

<p>"Arthur has given you peace;
and I&mdash;I, Charles, have only the love
that has waited for you these long,
weary years&mdash;that would have waited
for you until death!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And the sequel to this little Christmas
romance? Need we tell of the
wild joy and amazement that reëchoed
through the hoary old hall? Of
the girlish roses that deepened in
Aunt Caddy's still beautiful cheek,
and the radiant light in the wanderer's
clear dark eye as, a few months
later, the merry peal of wedding-bells
succeeded the Christmas chimes?</p>

<p>"A blithe bridal for a bonnie bride,"
Arthur had said when the long-parted
lovers pleaded his fast failing
health as a reason for a quiet wedding.</p>

<p>"Uncle Charles, if you don't have
a real glorious wedding, I'll marry
Aunt Caddy myself." Brightest and
merriest of all was the lordly young
host as he welcomed his guests with
the princely grace that so well became
him, though many a living
heart was sad, and kindly eye grew
dim, as they marked in the glowing
cheek and wasted form the fatal heritage
of his youthful parents.</p>

<p>Once only he himself betrayed
amid his graceful gayety the consciousness
of his early doom.</p>

<p>After their young lord had been
repeatedly toasted by the joyous tenantry,
some one merrily proposed,
"Sir Arthur's bride;" and "Our future
lady" was pledged in brimming
bumpers.</p>

<p>Arthur's face flushed for a moment
as he caught the unthinking shout;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
then, raising his own glass to his lips,
he bowed to his uncle's bride. "Aunt
Caddy, we drink your health. Long
life and happiness to the future lady
of Hurston!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A year later, and hushed voices
and noiseless steps alone were heard
around the dying couch of the fair
boy-baron. Patient and gentle as
ever, he waited with his own angelic
smile upon his lips the summons that
was to call him from life.</p>

<p>His uncle, pale with anxiety and
sorrow, watched with paternal love
over the dying boy's pillow, until an
attendant whispered something which
Arthur's fast failing ear caught.</p>

<p>"Bring him here, uncle; let me
see him before I go; let me see Aunt
Caddy's boy."</p>

<p>Colonel Thornbury called the attendant,
and they laid a little slumbering
babe in the dying boy's outstretched
arms. "Call him Arthur
for me, dear uncle, and do not grieve.
He has come to take my place; to
perpetuate the glorious old name; to
be all that I would have been if God
had so willed it. I am happy now;
so very, very happy!" He died with
the words yet on his lips, the smile
still on his face, the light scarce faded

<p>Years afterward, when the proud
spirit of her impetuous boy threatened
to burst from her gentle restraint,
and the fierce blood of his fiery ancestors
showed itself in his kindling
eye and mantling cheek, the gentle
Lady Hurston had one spell that
calmed his angriest moods. She
would whisper of that young cousin
who had breathed his last sigh with
her Arthur's first breath, with the
baby form clasped to his dying
breast, of those last words of hope and
happiness murmured over the slumbering
babe from the very portals of
eternity. "He said you were to take
his place, dear Arthur; be worthy of
him and of his name." And the
boy's eye would grow calm and
peaceful as it rested on the snowy
column&mdash;the column of which Arthur
had spoken when he foretold his own
doom:</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p>Count De Maistre somewhere
says that during the last century a reputation
was made much in the same
manner as you make a shoe, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Au
dernier siècle, on faisait une réputation
comme on fait un soulier</i>."</p>

<p>The manufacturing process indicated
by De Maistre was known and
practised long before the last century,
and is even at the present time
by no means to be counted among
the lost arts. This very day the
reader may look around him and
easily find numerous specimens of
the peculiar industry here described.
And going back two hundred years,
we may, out of many cases, select
that of a learned, laborious, self-sacrificing
and pious man, who, driven
to a premature grave by ingratitude,
neglect, and calumny, has been falsely
handed down to posterity as untruthful,
dishonest, brutal, and grossly
immoral. His transmitted reputation
was not the reflection of his deeds.
It was manufactured of shreds and
patches. Dying in the disgrace caused
by the displeasure of the prime
minister of a powerful monarch, it
would have been remarkable, indeed,
had any one at that day so forgotten
himself as to become the advocate of
a cause hopelessly lost. And so his
enemies had a clear field.</p>

<p>Writers of history and biography
of the years immediately succeeding
took their word, and subsequent biographers
and historians had merely
to repeat what their predecessors had
said. His story is fraught with more
than one moral, and the impressive
vindication of his character after the
silence of two centuries has something
in it that seems higher than mere
human agency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span></p>

<p>John Michael Wansleben was
born at Sommerda, near Erfurth,
November 1st, 1635. His father was
the Lutheran minister of the place.
At a proper age he was sent to the
University of Erfurth, and afterward
completed his studies at the University
of Königsberg in 1656. He
held for a short time a position as
private tutor, and entered the army
of the Elector of Brandenburg in
1657, serving as a private soldier
through the campaign of that year.</p>

<p>With some idea of embracing a
commercial career, he then visited
Schleswig, Amsterdam, Glückstadt,
and Hamburg, but without result,
and returned to Erfurth in 1658. Job
Ludolf, a distinguished <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savant</i> of Erfurth,
was then in the meridian of his
fame. Ludolf had been sent to
Rome in 1649, to make search for
the memoirs of John Magnus, Archbishop
of Upsal, a man noted for
his learning and piety, who, after an
unsuccessful struggle against the kingly
power of Gustavus Vasa, and the
introduction of Lutheranism into Sweden,
retired to Rome, where he died.
Ludolf, failing to find the memoirs
he sought, remained some time in
Rome, occupied in the study of the
Ethiopian tongue. He was, unquestionably,
a man of remarkable acquirements,
and was in his day credited
with knowing twenty-five languages.</p>

<p>Vansleb<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
attracted the attention
of Ludolf, and was received by him
partly as a pupil, partly as an assistant,
specially devoting himself, by
Ludolf's direction, to the study of
the Ethiopian language. In 1661,
when he was thought sufficiently advanced,
Ludolf sent him to London
to supervise the publication of his
Ethiopian dictionary. Vansleb performed
his task, and the dictionary
was published the same year. At
this time, the English polyglot edition
(six vols. folio) of the Bible, by
Walton, Bishop of Chester, was in
course of publication. There was in
that day no dearth of imitators of
Cardinal Ximenes. Although bearing
the name of Walton, it was the work
of several learned men, and its oriental
versions were copied from the
Bible of Le Jay, (Paris.) Distinguished
among its collaborators was Edmund
Castell, Canon of Canterbury,
an oriental scholar, who afterward
published his <i>Lexicon Heptaglotton</i>,
the fruit of eighteen hours' daily labor
for a period of seventeen years.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
Castell met with Vansleb, and engaged
him as his assistant, taking him
into his house and admitting him to
his table. For three years and a half
Vansleb labored with Castell, who thus
mentions him in the preface to his
<i>Lexicon</i>: "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">In ethiopicis per idem tempus
operam impendebat suam D. M.
Wanslebius, qui ad perpoliendum in
eisdem ingenium in varias orientis oras,
longa atque periculosa suscepit itinera.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>Returning to Germany, Vansleb
found that Ludolf, as the tutor of the
young princes of Saxony, had obtained
great credit and influence
with Duke Ernest, surnamed the
Pious. Ludolf had long cherished
the singular project of bringing about
an alliance between some German
prince and the King of Ethiopia,
(modern Abyssinia,) and by dint of
long conferences on the subject with
the duke, had succeeded in enlisting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
Ernest's enthusiastic interest in his
plan. This it was:</p>

<p>An ardent champion of what is
called Luther's Reformation, he was
assiduous in seeking for it moral support
wherever it could possibly be
found. He imagined that he saw a
certain degree of conformity between
Lutheranism and the Coptic rite, and
the idea of the appearance of antiquity
the new religion would receive
from a union with one of the oldest
oriental churches was more than
enough to awaken his warmest enthusiasm.
Ludolf, moreover, hoped,
through superior German civilization,
that Protestantism would be enabled
to exercise a decided influence upon
the retrograde population of Abyssinia.</p>

<p>The duke fully entered into all
these views with the most sanguine
hopes.</p>

<p>The better to appreciate Ludolf's
project, let us take a rapid glance at
the history of Abyssinia and its condition
at that time.</p>

<p>Ethiopia embraced Judaism during
the reign of Solomon, following the
example of Queen Sheba, who, according
to the best authorities, was
sovereign of that country.</p>

<p>It was also one of the first nations
converted to Christianity through the
baptism of the treasurer of Queen Candace,
by the Deacon Philip. (Acts of
the Apostles, viii. 27-38.) And this result
was predicted by God. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ethiopia
præveniet manus ejus Deo.</i><a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
(Psalm
lxvii. 32.) In the fifth century, Ethiopia
was drawn into the Eutychian heresy,
and, under the name of Jacobites, her
people to this day persevere in it.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century, the Portuguese
having rendered some signal
service to the reigning king, they obtained
from him authority allowing
Jesuit missionaries to enter the country.
They did so enter, and made
numerous conversions. But persecution
undid their work. Catholicity
was placed under ban, the faithful
pursued, and the dispersed missionaries
put to death. The two last Jesuits,
who remained with their neophytes,
were taken and hung in 1638.
Others sought to penetrate Abyssinia;
but all who entered the country were
arrested and decapitated. The king,
Basilides, was the most furious in
persecution. He persuaded himself
that the king of Portugal was organizing
against him a league of all the
monarchs in Europe. The very
name of Catholic was made treasonable;
and he sent his own brother to
execution simply on suspicion of leniency
to the hated religion.</p>

<p>It was mainly from his enmity to it
that he permitted, contrary to law,
the introduction of Mohammedanism,
and even sent for doctors to preach it
to his people. These so-called "disasters
of the papacy" were far from
being a subject of grief to the German
reformers, particularly to those
inspired with the desire of proselytism.
Duke Ernest was called the
Pious, and was now fired with the
ambition of adding illustration to his
surname.</p>

<p>The circumstances looked favorable
in the highest degree. Any thing
was sufficiently recommended to King
Basilides if it were only anti-Catholic;
and therefore, the success of the
Protestant mission was a foregone conclusion.</p>

<p>But who could be found capable
of executing such a mission? He
should be, independently of the requisite
religious qualification, a person
of experience and superior education&mdash;at
once a man of the world
and a scholar&mdash;and more, an oriental
scholar.</p>

<p>"I have him here in Erfurth," said
Ludolf to the duke; "an <i>alter ego</i>, as
familiar as I am with the language,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
literature, and customs of the Ethiopians."</p>

<p>He referred, of course, to Vansleb,
who was already fully advised in the
matter from long conferences with
Ludolf.</p>

<p>Duke Ernest assumed all the expenses
of the mission, drew up the
necessary instructions, and traced the
itinerary to be followed.</p>

<p>Vansleb was to make his way to
Egypt, and thence to Abyssinia, with
no more apparent object than the ordinary
curiosity of a traveller desirous
of studying the language and the
natural history of the country. In
case he found influential men favorably
disposed, he was to advise them
confidentially that a German prince
named Ernest, who held the Abyssinians
in high esteem, as well for their
warlike qualities as for their attachment
to the ancient faith of their fathers,
had given him letters for them
in their own language, and that he
was willing to make the necessary
advances in money to bring to Europe
a certain number of well-disposed
young Abyssinians desirous of instructing
themselves as to the condition
of the Christian reformed churches,
and thus bring about, between the
two peoples and confessions, a sincere
and lasting friendship.</p>

<p>In every respect the proposition
suited Vansleb. The arrangement
was soon completed, and he was invested
with all the necessary powers
of an ambassador, but in a disguised
and indirect form, with special instructions
not to exhibit his credentials
until fully satisfied that his advances
would be met.</p>

<p>The result of this remarkable embassy
is soon told. Ludolf himself
relates that he does not know whether
to attribute the failure of a plan
conceived with all possible prudence
to the parsimony of the duke or to
the imprudence of Vansleb. That
Ludolf, who, after this period, never
hesitated to paint Vansleb in the
blackest colors, should make it a
matter of doubt, is quite enough to
justify the latter.</p>

<p>And now let us accompany Vansleb
on his route to Ethiopia. He
reached Cairo in January, 1664, and
spent a year in visiting Egypt, and
in studying and copying Abyssinian
books. The Coptic Patriarch of Alexandria,
Matthew de Mir, whose jurisdiction
extended over the churches
of Ethiopia, dissuaded Vansleb
from attempting to penetrate that
country, and he addressed Duke Ernest
a letter in Arabic, giving the reasons
for his advice, which letter is
still preserved in the ducal library of
Saxe-Gotha.</p>

<p>And now the grand project of
Ernest was visited&mdash;humanly speaking&mdash;with
poetic justice. The Coptic
patriarch, who was pleased with
Vansleb, obtained from him an exposition
of the history of the reformation
and of Lutheran doctrine, and
Vansleb, instructed in return, could, as
he listened to the patriarch, compare
the German novelties with the antique
symbol of the oriental communions.
The result was inevitable, and
he began to see a light that illuminated
his mind and made evident his
errors. He soon afterward embarked
for Italy, fully resolved to seek admission
to the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>Landing at Leghorn, he went to
Florence, where he spent some time,
and was protected by the prince, who
was afterward Cosmo (de' Medici)
III. Here, also, he made the acquaintance
of the British ambassador,
Finch, whom he subsequently
met at Smyrna. Going to Rome,
he there abjured Protestantism, was
received into the church, and entered
the Dominican convent of the Minerva.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
This order, specially devoted
to teaching and preaching, was best
suited to his tastes and habits.</p>

<p>And here, for a period of four
years, Vansleb disappears from the
world and from history. He passed
them in solitude, exclusively occupied
with study and religious exercises.</p>

<p>Meantime, imagine, if you can,
the storm that broke at Erfurth.
Duke Ernest was bitterly disappointed,
as was natural; but it would be
difficult to describe the fury of Ludolf.
It burst forth never to be extinguished
but with his death. Vansleb,
so warmly recommended by Ludolf
to the duke, suddenly became
a monster not only of ingratitude, but
of every other possible vice. There
were no limits to the abuse nor to
the accusations of the angry professor.</p>

<p>All this did not then trouble Vansleb,
but he was made to feel their
effects long afterward.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p>At the end of his four years with
the Dominicans of Rome, Vansleb
went to France, where he was presented
by Bosquet, the learned Bishop
of Montpellier, to the minister
Colbert, as a man of superior merits
and of great erudition in the oriental
languages. Succeeding Mazarin and
Fouquet in the councils of Louis
XIV., Colbert aimed to distinguish
his administration by fostering letters,
sciences, and the arts.</p>

<p>The Royal Library, of sixteen thousand
volumes at the accession of the
king, contained seventy thousand at
the end of his reign&mdash;an increase
mainly due to Colbert. At once recognizing
the merit of Vansleb, Colbert
charged him with an important
Scientific mission. He was instructed
to travel through oriental countries,
and especially to visit Mount Athos,
the island of Chio, Aleppo, Mount
Sinai, Nitria, Constantinople, Turkey,
Persia, and Baalbec; everywhere
seeking and purchasing Arabian,
Turkish, Persian, and Greek books
and manuscripts. He was to make
his way to the most remarkable monasteries
for the purpose of obtaining
certain ecclesiastical works; to collect
rare medals, statues, and <i>bas-reliefs</i>,
besides preparations in botany, natural
history, and mineralogy; to give
descriptions of machinery, utensils,
costumes, and vestments of the different
nations he saw; to copy inscriptions
on monuments, pillars, obelisks,
and tombstones. He will keep aloof&mdash;continued
his directions&mdash;from political
complications, wear such costumes
as he may think proper, and
select the route which to him seems
best.</p>

<p>The original of these instructions
was found only a few years since
among the papers of Vansleb. They
bear this singular indorsement in the
handwriting of Colbert himself: "I
do not understand these instructions,
more particularly as you proposed
Vansleb for a mission to Ethiopia,
which country is not even mentioned.
The instructions, as they stand, might
just as well have been given by the
French ambassador at Constantinople."</p>

<p>In point of fact, the instructions
had been drawn up by Carcavy, the
royal librarian, a man of great merit.
He saw almost insurmountable obstacles
to the success of an Ethiopian
mission, and thought it better to
confine its authorization to merely
verbal instructions, leaving it to Vansleb
to attempt it or not, as he might
find most advisable.</p>

<p>The dissatisfaction of Colbert was
not at first fully appreciated, but it
was doubtless the germ of the neglect
with which Vansleb was afterward
treated, and of the coolness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
injustice of his reception when he returned.</p>

<p>Vansleb departed on this, his second
journey to the East, in the
spring of 1671, and visited Malta,
Cyprus, Aleppo, Damascus, and a
part of Ph&oelig;nicia. He reached Damietta
in March, 1672, after a journey
marked by delays, dangers,
storms, and sickness; for oriental
travel was not the comparatively
easy and comfortable journeying of
to-day, nor had the brutality and
tyranny of eastern officials toward
Christians been rebuked and corrected
as they since have been. Establishing
his headquarters at Cairo,
Vansleb made numerous excursions
to the Pyramids, the Sphinx, and the
various monuments then so novel,
but now so familiar to Europeans,
and indeed to Americans. After renewing
his acquaintance with the
Patriarch Matthew de Mir, who had
unconsciously been the instrument of
his conversion to Catholicity, Vansleb
embarked for Rosetta in May,
1672.</p>

<p>But we do not propose to follow
our traveller through all his wanderings.
They were full of novelty for
him and for those who, at that period,
read his descriptions of them. In
1673, he visited Upper Egypt and
explored the antiquities of Esneh and
Denderah, and the remains of ancient
Thebes at Luxor and Karnak.
At Lycopolis, the Bishop Amba
Joannes introduced to him one
Muallim Athanarius, the only man in
all Egypt, he said, who spoke the
Coptic language. Vansleben did not
converse with him, but flattered himself
on having seen the man with
whom the Coptic language was to
expire. After exploring the Thebaide
and its grottos, and visiting the
ruins of Enseneh, the column of Marcus
Aurelius and the Triumphal Arch,
he returned to Cairo. Of course he
had not lost sight of one of the main
objects of his mission, the purchase
of rare and valuable works for the
Royal Library. He neglected no
opportunity to obtain them, and up
to this period of his journey he had
purchased and forwarded to Paris
three hundred and thirty-four volumes,
Turkish, Persian, and Arabic.
Compelled to deal with people of all
classes, some of them had spoken of
his purchases, and by the time he returned
to Cairo it was reported that
the Frank stranger was gathering all
the sacred books in the country for
the purpose of sending them away to
the infidels. The Mohammedan laws
made it a capital crime for a stranger
to buy, sell, or even have in his possession
any of their books, whether
treating of religion or any other subject.
To exemplify the feeling with
which they regard the possession of
their books by infidels, (Christians,)
M. Champollion Figeac relates that
during the reign of Louis Philippe a
number of young Arabs were sent to
France by Mehemet Ali, Viceroy of
Egypt, and among them two sons of
the viceroy. While visiting the Royal
Library, M. Champollion took pains
to show one of the young princes the
magnificent copy of the Koran taken
from a mosque in Cairo during the
French expedition to Egypt. When
he saw what the book was, the young
Arab turned away his head, covering
his face with both hands.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances, Vansleb
of course understood at once that
he could not remain in Egypt. For
two years he had been dealing in
books, and, if arrested, there was evidence
enough to take his life a hundred
times. Without losing a day,
he at once set out for Constantinople.
Touching at Rhodes and the island
of Chio, he went to Smyrna, where,
to his great astonishment, and contrary
to his uniform experience in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
East, his letters of introduction and
his credentials were made light of
by the resident French consul, who
more than insinuated that he suspected
him of being an impostor.</p>

<p>Personally wounded, and annoyed
at a circumstance that endangered
his mission and deprived him of the
only legal protector to whom he
could have recourse in case of difficulty,
Vansleben sought advice and
assistance of the English consul, Paul
Ricault. Notwithstanding his decidedly
French name, Ricault was a
veritable Englishman, born in London
within the sound of Bow bells.
He had been secretary of the Earl of
Winchelsea, and ambassador extraordinary
of Charles II. to Mohammed
IV. After serving eleven years as
consul of England at Smyrna, Clarendon
appointed him, in 1685, his
first secretary for the provinces of
Connaught and Leinster. He was
afterward privy councillor and judge
of the Admiralty, and under William
III. was minister resident for the
Hanseatic towns. He is the author
of a <i>History of the Present Condition
of the Ottoman Empire</i>, and other
works of merit. The two scholars
Ricault and Vansleb immediately
sympathized, and through Ricault
Vansleb renewed the acquaintance
of the ambassador Finch, whom he
had met in Florence, and who was
then on his way to Constantinople.
Unfortunately for Vansleb, a serious
difficulty just then arose between the
two consuls, English and French, on
account of some incivility offered by
the latter to the ambassador on his
arrival. Already prepossessed against
Vansleben, through some underhand
man&oelig;uvre, Chambon, the French consul,
from that moment became his
bitter enemy, alleging as one of the
principal accusations against him his
personal intimacy with the enemies
of France. In those days there were
no lines of Mediterranean packetboats,
and Vansleb was glad to accept
the invitation of the ambassador
to take passage on the man-of-war
which was to transport him and his
suite to Constantinople. This added
fuel to the flame of Chambon's
resentment, and he thereafter left nothing
undone to injure Vansleb in the
East and in France. Vansleb's destination
was perfectly well known, and
he had hardly set foot in Constantinople
when he perceived that Smyrna
had been heard from. The Marquis
de Nointel was temporarily absent
when Vansleb arrived; but the manner
of his reception by those in charge
of the ambassador's residence, and by
the merchants of the Company of
the Levant, for whom he had letters,
made it plain to him that these people
to whom he was a stranger had
already been set against him.</p>

<p>He found lodgings (by no means
gratuitous) at the house of a French
apothecary named Chaber, who discoursed
eloquently on the shortcomings
of the French embassy, criticising
its extravagance, and its want of
consideration for the French merchants
of the Levant, who were heavily
taxed to maintain its expensive
display.</p>

<p>Vansleb, unfortunately, joined in
the conversation, although saying but
little. He afterward discovered that
his few words were wrested to his
prejudice. With his experience he
should have been more on his guard,
but he could not entirely overcome
his native simplicity of character.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Innocens credit omni verbo.</i> To add
to his annoyances, he was arrested
by a Turkish patrol for wearing his
beard and a turban, thrust into prison,
subjected to personal indignities,
and barely escaped the bastinado.
Meantime, his salary was in arrears;
and as it was his intention to strike
from this point for Ethiopia, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
necessary that he should start with
a full purse. He bridged over the
unavoidable delay by excursions to
Broussa and the environs, and a trip
to Chio, in order to witness the celebrated
<i>mastic</i> harvest, which was at
that time made the occasion of a religious
festival. At Chio he had made
several friends, on his former visit&mdash;Dom
Georgio, the curate of the cathedral,
Dom Matthew, the vicar-general,
and a Dr. Pepano, who was
acquainted with Vansleb's <i>History of
the Church of Alexandria</i>. The doctor
was enthusiastic as to the rewards
he felt certain must await Vansleb on
his return to France, and composed
an acrostic in his honor, which ran
thus:</p>

</table></div>

<p>"He had not the gift of prophecy,"
calmly writes Vansleb years afterward,
when in poverty and disgrace.
Returning to Constantinople, Vansleb
visited Mitylene and Tenedos.</p>

<p>In January, 1675, he wrote to Colbert
that he was in absolute want on
account of the non-payment of his
salary. In April, he received a small
remittance of one hundred and fifty
francs. A letter from Carcavy, of
April, 1674, received July 20th, announced
orders soon to be issued for
the continuance of his mission. But
the orders were as slow in arriving
as his salary. Again, on the 20th of
March, he wrote to Colbert, expressing
his impatient anxiety to be again
at work, and suggesting various journeys,
all of them important, which
he was ready to make&mdash;to Trebizond,
the Chersonesus, to Persia, Syria,
Mount Lebanon, Baalbec; or he
would even return to Egypt, where he
would have the advantage of former
experience, and his late acquisition
of the Greek and Turkish languages,
which he now spoke fluently, and
where he could now be protected
against annoyance by a passport from
the sultan. Meantime, Carcavy had
assured Vansleben that his labors
were fully appreciated and praised
by Colbert. Finally, on the 22d
of October, our traveller received
two letters from the minister, dated
July 4th and August 17th; but the
money orders they contained were
not cashed by the Company of the
Levant until the following December.</p>

<p>Writing to Colbert in November,
Vansleben says, "And what greater
satisfaction could I have than to
start immediately for the country to
which your excellency sends me?"
So that some new country was designated
by Colbert in his letter. What
was it? It could only be Ethiopia,
according to the original design, and
Vansleben's preparations at the time
appear to have been for that direction.
In December, having received
two thousand francs, he writes to Colbert
on the 18th that, but for the delay
of waiting for a caravan and the
passport of the sultan, he should already
have started; that he expects
to depart in January; to pass a month
at Aleppo, in order to see Antioch
and the Euphrates; thence to Damascus
and the country of the Druses;
thence to Jerusalem; from which
he would take a fresh departure for
Egypt, no longer as a Frank traveller
but as an oriental, and there await a
favorable occasion to penetrate into
Ethiopia.</p>

<p>And now, just at the moment when
a fresh horizon of useful enterprise
was opening before him, when the
thick clouds of envy, malevolence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
and misfortune were apparently dispersed,
the bolt fell that for ever shattered
his career, forced him back in
disgrace, and sent him bowed down
with sorrows and persecution to a
premature grave.</p>

<p>What had in the mean time taken
place&mdash;what reports, complaints, or
insinuations had been brought to Colbert's
ear, has never been clearly ascertained;
but a dispatch from him
of the thirtieth September, addressed
to Nointel, advised the ambassador
that Vansleb was recalled to Paris.
Docile and respectful, he immediately
prepared to obey. Nointel advises
Colbert in reply, January 5th, 1676,
that Vansleb was just ready to start
on his eastern journey, and had already
expended some money in its preparation.</p>

<p>"Unhesitatingly though, and with
apparent satisfaction, he sails to-morrow
for France, <i>viâ</i> Malta."</p>

<p>Forced by storms to stop in the
island of Candia, (ancient Crete,) and
also at Milo, Vansleb continued his
labors of observation and research as
though his mission had just begun.
His return by sea was slow and tedious,
and being moreover detained by
illness at Lyons, he did not reach
Paris until the end of April, 1676. It
was a long time before he could obtain
audience of the minister, whose
reception of him was freezing and
curt. The year wore away in expectation,
and winter had come again
before he could obtain a second interview
with Colbert, which was more
discouraging than the first.</p>

<p>Meantime, the arrearages due him,
as well for his salary as for expenditures,
were not paid, and he was
obliged to sell his own Ethiopian <span class="smcap">MSS.</span>
in order to live.</p>

<p>Finally, a vigorous <i>placet</i> dispatched
to Colbert July 15th, 1677, obtained
a third and last interview with the
minister.</p>

<p>In this, Colbert, without making
any accusation against Vansleb, intrenched
himself in a refusal pure
and simple, either to allow him any
indemnity or to pay the amount
claimed by him for his advances.</p>

<p>Meantime, the poor monk's brother
Dominicans who, on his arrival,
had received him kindly, had evidently
been affected by the disgrace to
which an all-powerful minister had
consigned the unfortunate traveller,
and Vansleb's relations with them
soon ceased.</p>

<p>Discouraged and broken-hearted,
he left Paris, and after passing a few
months with Counsellor Langeois at
Atys, accepted the hospitality of M.
Texier, the curé of Bourron, a small
village near Fontainebleau. This
kind priest's sympathy and affection
alone, of earthly things, softened his
rapid descent to the grave; for he
only survived by nine months his arrival
at Bourron, where he died June
12th, 1679, at the age of forty-four
years.</p>

<p>During his oriental journey, Vansleb
had scarcely been free from fever
and ague, and he had contracted in
Egypt an ophthalmic affection that
gave him trouble. But neither of
these maladies, nor both of them together,
were sufficient to have caused
his death. It seemed a sudden sinking
of the moral forces rather than
the physical that made him so sudden
a prey to dissolution.</p>

<p>The man Vansleben's enemies represented
him to be would not so
easily have succumbed. The liar,
the cheat, the libertine they painted
would have had no heart to break.</p>

<p>Thus, in the obscurity of a small
village, near the solitude of a great
forest, Vansleb silently descended
into the tomb. The earthly sounds
that gathered around his existence
had ceased, and the phantom of his
fame was buried with his earthly remains.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
As his death had been obscure,
so his last resting-place was
hidden from the public gaze. At the
peril of his life, he endowed France
with the scientific riches that may
still be seen in her royal collections;
yet under the most prodigal of her
monarchs he did not receive the recompense
of a winding-sheet, or the
poor commemoration of a gravestone.</p>

<p>Even England was more generous,
at least in appreciation of his merit.</p>

<p>On Vansleb's return from Egypt,
Dr. Bernard, of the University of
Oxford, composed in his honor the
following lines:</p>

<div class="cpoem" lang="la" xml:lang="la"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Deseris Ægyptum spoliis majoribus auctus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quam gens Hebræum sub duce Mose tulit!"<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Of Vansleb's merits as a <i>savant</i>
there could be no question. Before
he left London, his reputation was already
established as an oriental scholar,
although his knowledge at that
time was small compared with what
he afterward acquired. Latin, Greek,
and Hebrew he knew well, and he
spoke and wrote correctly and fluently
the German, French, Italian, English,
Arabic, modern Greek, Turkish,
and Ethiopian languages. His principal
published works are,</p>

<p>The works on Egypt and on the
Church of Alexandria, it will be remarked,
were published on his return
from the east, precisely at the period
of his severest trials. There is quite
an interesting chapter in the history
of criticism connected with Vansleb's
work on the Church of Alexandria, a
work of great merit, which covered
nearly the same ground as that of a
<i>History of Abyssinia</i> written by Ludolf.
This, of course, was, in Ludolf's
eyes, only another and a greater
crime added to those of which he
had already accused Vansleb.</p>

<p>Although Moreri, Le Grand, Michaud,
and Renaudot were all more
or less misled as to Vansleb's personal
character, they testify unanimously
as to the positive merit of the work
in question, and to its superiority
over that of Ludolf. It is remarkable
that Father Papebrock and his illustrious
colleague Bollandus were led
astray, and indeed deceived, by Ludolf.
They had confidence in him
as a brother <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savant</i>, but leaned too
much upon him. Their error was
naturally shared by the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal de
Trevoux</cite>, and thence extended to
other Jesuits.</p>

<p>Although Vansleb's works were at
first freely used, they were not freely
quoted. Gradually they sank out of
sight. Only rare catalogues chronicled
them, and his unpublished <span class="smcap">MSS</span>.
had totally disappeared. Occasional
echoes of his name might, at intervals,
be heard in the sanctuaries of science,
and these, rarely repeated during two
centuries, became at last so feeble as
no longer to be perceptible.</p>

<p>But sleep is not death, nor is night
an eternal eclipse. The day of reparation
was at last about to dawn, and
the memory of Vansleb to arise vindicated
from the tomb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span></p>


<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p>M. Champollion Figeac, the well-known
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savant</i> and orientalist, was for
many years conservator of the Imperial
Library of the palace at Fontainebleau.
One day in 1856<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
he attended
the sale of the library of the
late Marquis de Coulanges. His
daughter relates that on his return
he appeared to be in a state of high
mental excitement, the main symptom
of which was the manifestation
of extravagant joy. Convulsively embracing
her, he exhibited a volume
he had just purchased, and which appeared
to be the cause of his superlative
satisfaction. The volume was
Vansleb's manuscript. Familiar with
Vansleb's published works, M. Champollion
and many other scholars
had long regretted the loss of this
manuscript. His joy at finding it
can readily be understood. Finding
an indorsement on the manuscript
that indicated Bourron as the place
of Vansleb's death and burial, M.
Champollion immediately wrote to
the curé of that village for information
as to Vansleb, and as to the condition
of his tomb. But the deceased
monk had passed so short a time
at Bourron that he had left absolutely
no trace in the local traditions
of the place, and no one there had
ever seen or heard of his tomb.
However, on a careful search of the
registers, the entry of his burial was
found, and his last resting-place sufficiently
indicated.</p>

<p>In 1859, the church was completely
renovated, and advantage was taken
of that circumstance to search for
and find the remains of the poor
monk. After the necessary formalities
of identification had been complied
with, they were carefully re-interred,
and M. Champollion, having
interested the emperor in the
matter, was authorized to have erected
over the grave an appropriate and
elegant monument, bearing the inscription
of which the following is a
translation:</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">To the Memory of<br />
John Michael Vansleb,<br />
Dominican of the Minerva,<br />
Learned Traveller in the East,<br />
By order of Louis XIV.<br />
Died, Vicar of Bourron,<br />
June 12, 1679.<br />
Restoration of his Tomb<br />
Under the Auspices of the Emperor,<br />
Napoleon III.,<br />
In the Year 1861.</span><br />
</p>

<p>But a more important rehabilitation
remained to be made, and
M. Champollion showed, if possible,
greater zeal in this than in the merely
material one. Vansleb's <span class="smcap">MSS.</span> and
letters were carefully examined and
found to throw new and important
light on capital incidents heretofore
either totally suppressed or wrested
to his disadvantage.</p>

<p>Too aged and infirm even to undertake
a task which would have
been to him only a labor of love,
M. Champollion confided the papers
to the Abbé Pougeois, the present
curé of Bourron, who, under the inspiration
of the learned orientalist,
prepared a careful and elaborate
memoir of the forgotten Dominican.
It was eminently fitting, and poetic in
its justice, that Vansleb's vindication
should come from the double source
of science and the church. On the completion
of the Abbé Pougeois' work,
it was, by order of the emperor, submitted
for examination to M. Octave
Feuillet, member of the French Academy,
and the successor of M. Champollion
at Fontainebleau. The report
being entirely favorable, the Abbé
Pougeois' memoir was ordered to be
published at the expense of the emperor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
under the title, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vansleb, savant,
orientaliste, et voyageur. Sa Vie, sa
Disgrace, ses &OElig;uvres. Par M. l'Abbé
Pougeois, Curé de Bourron.</i> Paris,
1869. The book is a large and
handsome volume of 481 octavo
pages. It has been freely used in
the preparation of this article.</p>

<p>The current misrepresentations concerning
Vansleb were taken up into
the literary history of the period,
and have been ever since repeated
by successive historians and biographers.
Nevertheless, some of them
were apparently struck with the inconsistencies
and contradictions involved
in the charges against the defenceless
monk, and gradually the most offensive
of these were dropped. Among
the modern biographical notices of
Vansleb, that contained in Charles
Knight's <i>English Cyclopædia</i> (article
"Wansleben;" nearly identical with
one in the <i>Penny Cyclopædia</i>) is generally
fair. It states, however, that Vansleb
"was called to account for moneys
intrusted to his disposal, and disgraced
for misapplying them." Although
the writer of that notice doubtless
had the warrant of half a dozen biographies
for making the statement, it
is utterly devoid of truth; so much
so, indeed, that at the period of his
death Vansleb was the creditor, not
the debtor, of the French government.
Colbert was to have paid
Vansleb the miserable salary of two
thousand francs per annum, and one
thousand francs for the purchase of
<span class="smcap">MSS.</span> and valuable curiosities! Even
allowing liberally for the difference in
the values of money then and now,
two thousand francs still remains a
pitiable sum wherewith to remunerate
one year's services of such a man
as Vansleb.</p>

<p>With the miserable stipend of one
thousand francs per annum, he purchased
and sent (in 1671-72 and
1673) to the Royal Library, where
they still remain, four hundred and
fifty-seven valuable <span class="smcap">MSS.</span> and books,
Arabic, Turkish, Persian, Coptic, and
Ethiopian, besides a large quantity
of inscriptions on stone and metal,
marbles, medals, and animals, living
and dead.</p>

<p>If we must believe Vansleb's traducers,
we witness the strange spectacle
of a defaulter insisting upon
and with difficulty obtaining an interview
with his principal. And this
not once, but twice and thrice. In
one of his letters to Colbert, written
March 20th, 1677, more than a
month after his return to Paris, Vansleb
claims as due him&mdash;<i>First.</i> The
amount expended in preparation for
the journey he was about to undertake
when ordered back by the minister.
<i>Second.</i> The balance of his
last account rendered. <i>Third.</i> The
amount still unpaid him for books,
<span class="smcap">MSS.</span>, etc., sent to the Royal Library.
<i>Fourth.</i> His salary up to the time he
was definitely discharged, at the third
and last audience accorded him by
the minister. The letter referred to
is dignified, firm, and moderate&mdash;as
unlike as possible in its tone that of
a defaulter and a dishonest man.
Thus, he tells Colbert,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Perceiving that I have good reason to
expect from your excellency neither munificence
nor liberality, nor even such an honorable
recompense as I had every just reason
to look for after such long and important
labors, I at least do not anticipate from
your excellency's justice, since you insist
upon a rigorous settlement, a refusal to pay
the balance due me for expenditures in the
service of his majesty, and which I have not
claimed until now, for the reason that I was
warranted in presuming upon such a fair
remuneration as would cover it. In as few
words as possible, then, my lord, and with
rigorous exactitude, there is due me&mdash;"<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span></p>
<p>And here follows the recapitulation
already presented.</p>

<p>The injustice and indignity with
which Vansleb was treated by Colbert
is in marked contrast to the liberality
usually displayed by Louis
XIV. and his administration toward
travellers whose merits were far inferior
to those of the Dominican monk.
On Tavernier, who brought back
with him from his travels precious
stones to the value of three millions,
distinguished honors and letters of
nobility were conferred. Sanson, the
geographer, besides honorary titles, received
a salary of two thousand livres.
Vaillant, who made a journey somewhat
similar to that of Vansleb, was
honored with a position in one of the
academies, and endowed with a pension.
Tournefort, who travelled in the
east under order of the court, was
absent but two years, had all his expenses
paid, and received a salary (in
advance) of three thousand livres.
He returned in 1702, at a period
when the French finances were far
from prosperous, and was awarded a
recompense beyond his salary. Paul
Lucas, toward the end of Louis XIV.'s
reign, was also an eastern explorer.
His travels were published by the
king's command. They are filled
with amusing but absurd stories,
which diverted the king and made
the traveller's fortune.</p>

<p>Vansleb's solid erudition was not
so profitable. His published works,
which are of a nature to interest none
but the archæologist, the ethnographer,
and the theologian, may soon
be forgotten, and need no further notice
than the few words we have given
them; but it is eminently proper
that we should, in his case, contribute
our mite to the vindication of
truth and the rehabilitation of a too
long suffering reputation.</p>

<h2>ANGELA.</h2>


<h3>CHAPTER VII.<br />
POISONOUS FOOD.</h3>

<p>"Herr Frank has not been here
for four days," said Siegwart as he
returned one day from the field.
"He will not come to-day, for it is
already nine o'clock. I hope the
young man is not ill."</p>

<p>Angela started.</p>

<p>"Ill? May God forbid!"</p>

<p>"At least, I know no other reason
that could prevent him from coming.
He has become a necessity to me; I
seem to miss something."</p>

<p>Angela concealed her uneasiness in
true womanly fashion. She busied
herself about the room, dusted the
furniture, arranged the vases and
trimmed the flowers; but one could
see that her mind was not in the
work.</p>

<p>"Would it not be well, father, to
send and inquire after his health?"</p>

<p>"It would if we were certain that
he was ill. I only made a conjecture.
However, if he does not come
to-morrow, I will send Henry over.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
We owe him this attention; he is
sensible, modest, and very intelligent.
We find at present in the cities and
first families few young men of so little
assumption and so much goodness
and manliness."</p>

<p>Angela pricked her finger. She
had incautiously wandered into the
thicket, as if she did not know that
roses have thorns.</p>

<p>"Many things tell of his kind-heartedness,"
she replied, with averted face.
"He sends five dollars every week to
the old blind woman in Salingen; he
often takes the money himself, and
comforts the unfortunate creature.
The blind woman is full of enthusiasm
about him. He bought the cooper
a full set of tools, that he might be
able to support his mother and seven
little sisters."</p>

<p>"Very praiseworthy," said the father.</p>

<p>As Siegwart came home in the evening,
Angela met him in the yard.
She carried a basket and was about
to go into the garden.</p>

<p>"Herr Frank is not unwell," said
he; "I saw him in the field and went
through the vineyard to meet him;
but when he discovered my intention,
he turned about and hastened toward
the house. That surprises me."</p>

<p>Angela went into the garden. She
stood on the bed and gazed at the
lettuce. The empty basket awaited
its contents, and in it lay the knife
whose bright blade glistened before
the idle dreamer. She stood thus meditating,
lost in thought for a long
time, which was certainly not her
custom.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Herr Frank had returned from the
city, and was roughly received by the
doctor.</p>

<p>"Have you spoken to your son?"
said he sharply.</p>

<p>"No! I have just alighted from
the carriage," answered Frank in astonishment.</p>

<p>The doctor walked up and down
the room, and Frank saw his face
growing darker.</p>

<p>"You disturb me, good friend.
How is Richard?"</p>

<p>"Bad, very bad! And it is all
your fault. You gave Richard those
materialistic books which I threw out
of the window. He has read the
trash&mdash;not read, but studied it; and
now we have the consequences."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, doctor. I did not
give my son those books. He was
passing the window when you threw
them out, and took them to his
room."</p>

<p>"You knew that! Why did you
leave him the miserable trash?"</p>

<p>"I had no idea of the danger of
these writings. Explain yourself further,
I entreat."</p>

<p>"You must first see your son. But
I bind it on your conscience to use
the greatest precaution. Do not show
the least surprise. We have to deal
with a dangerous disorder. Do not
say a word about his changed appearance.
Then come back to me
again."</p>

<p>Greatly disturbed, the father passed
to the room of his son. Richard sat
on the sofa gazing at the floor. His
cheeks had lost their bloom, his face
was emaciated, and his eyes deeply
sunken. Vogt's <i>Physiological Letters</i>
lay open near him. He did not rise
quickly and joyfully to kiss his father,
as was his custom. He remained sitting,
and smiled languidly at him.
Herr Frank, grieved and perplexed,
sat down near him, and took occasion
to pick up the book.</p>

<p>"How are you, Richard?"</p>

<p>"Very well, as you see."</p>

<p>"You are industrious. What book
is this?"</p>

<p>"A rare book, father&mdash;a remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
book. One learns there to know
what man is and what he is not.
Until now, I did not know that cats,
dogs, monkeys, and all animals were
of our race. Now I know; for it is
clearly demonstrated in that book."</p>

<p>"You certainly do not believe such
absurdities?"</p>

<p>"Believe? I believe nothing at
all. Faith ends where proof begins."</p>

<p>Herr Frank read the open page.</p>

<p>"All this sounds very silly," said
he. "Vogt asserts that man has no
soul, and proves it from the fact that
men become idiotic. If the functions
of the brain are disturbed, the
soul ceases, says Vogt. He therefore
concludes that the spirit consists in
the brain. The man must have been
crazy when he wrote that. I am no
scholar; but I see at the first glance
how false and groundless are Vogt's
inferences. Every reasonable man
knows that the brain is the instrument
of the mind, which enables it to participate
in the world of sense; now,
when the instrument is destroyed, the
participation of the mind with the outward
world must cease. Although a
man may be an expert on the violin,
he cannot play if the strings are broken
or out of tune. But the player,
his ideas, the art, still remain. In
like manner the spirit remains, although
it can no longer play on the
injured or discordant fibres of the
brain."</p>

<p>"You must read the whole book,
father, and then those others there."</p>

<p>"But, Richard, you must not read
books that rob man of all dignity."</p>

<p>"Of course not. I should do as
the ostrich. When he is in danger,
he sticks his head into the bushes
not to see the danger. A prudent
plan. But I cannot close my eyes to
the light, even if that light should destroy
my human respect."</p>

<p>Greatly afflicted, Herr Frank returned
to the doctor.</p>

<p>"Great God! in what a condition
is my poor Richard!" said the oppressed
father.</p>

<p>"He will, I hope, be rescued. My
stay at Frankenhöhe was to end with
the month of May; but I cannot forsake
a young man whom I love,
in this helpless state of mental delirium."</p>

<p>"I do not understand the condition
of my son; and your words give
me great anxiety. Have the goodness
to tell me what is the matter
with Richard, and how it came
about."</p>

<p>"It would be very difficult to make
your son's condition clear to you.
In you there is only business, lucrative
undertakings, speculative combinations.
The bustle of the money
market is your world. You have no
idea of the power of an intellectual
struggle. You know the thoughtful,
intellectual nature of your son; and
here I begin. In the first place, I will
remind you that Richard wishes to
be governed by the power of deduction.
With him fantasies and passions
retreat before this force, although usually
in men of his years, and even in
men with gray hair, clearness of mind
and keen penetration are often swept
away by the current of stormy passions.
Richard's aversion to women
is the result of cool reflection and inevitable
inference, and therefore on
this question I do not dispute his
views. I know it would be useless,
and I know that the study of a pure
feminine nature would overcome this
prejudice. The same force of logical
inferences places Richard in this unhappy
condition. He read the writings
of the materialist. There he
found the physiological proofs that
man is a beast. From these proofs
Richard drew all the terrible consequences
contained in those destructive
doctrines. As the intellectual life
predominates in him, and as he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
a strong repugnance to materialistic
madness, his nature must be stirred in
its profoundest depths. If Richard
succumbs, he will act in his habitual
consistent manner. All moral basis
lost, morality would be foolishness to
him, since it is useless for beasts to curb
the passions by moral laws. As with
immortality disappears man's eternal
destiny, it would be foolish to "fight
the giant fight of duty." If he is convinced
that man is a beast, he will
live like a beast&mdash;although he might
cloak his conduct with the varnish of
decency&mdash;and thus suddenly would
the sensible Richard stand before his
astonished father a ruined man. This
is one view; there is still another,"
said the doctor hesitatingly. "I remember
in the course of my practice
a suicide who wrote on a slip of paper,
'What do I here? Eat, drink, sleep,
worry, and fret; much suffering, little
joy; therefore&mdash;' and the man
sent a bullet through his head. This
suicide thought logically. This earthly
life is insupportable; it is foolishness
to a man who thinks and is at
the same time a materialist."</p>

<p>"What prospects&mdash;horrible!" cried
Herr Frank, wringing his hands.
"Accursed be those books; and I am
the cause of this misfortune!"</p>

<p>"The involuntary cause," said
Klingenberg consolingly. "You now
have a firm conviction of the devastating
effects of those bad books.
But how many are there who consider
every warning in this connection
an exhibition of prejudice or narrow-mindedness!
How few readers are
so modest as to admit that they want
the scientific culture to refute a bad
book, to separate the poison from the
honey of sweet phrases and winning
style! How few can see that they
cannot read those bad books without
detriment! No one would sit on a
cask of powder and touch it off for
amusement; and yet those hellish
books are more dangerous than a
cask full of powder. To me this is
incomprehensible. Poisonous food is
always injurious; yet thousands and
millions drink greedily from this poisonous
stream of bad reading which
deluges all grades of society."</p>

<p>"I will do immediately what must
be done," said Herr Frank as he hastily
rose.</p>

<p>"What will you do?"</p>

<p>"Take from my son those execrable
books."</p>

<p>"By no means," said Klingenberg.
"This would be a psychological mistake.
Richard would buy the same
books again at the book-shop, and
read them secretly. A man who has
the resolution of your son must be
won by honorable combat. Authority
would here be badly applied.
Therefore I forbid you to interfere.
You know nothing of the matter.
Treat him kindly, and have forbearance
with his sensitiveness. That
is what I must require of you."</p>

<p>Greatly afflicted, Herr Frank left
the doctor. Overwhelming himself
with reproaches, he wandered restlessly
about the house and garden.
He saw Richard standing at the open
window with folded arms, dreamy
and pale, his hair in disorder like
a storm-beaten wheat-field&mdash;truly a
painful sight for the father. He went
up to his room, where the small library
stood in its beautiful binding. A
servant stood near him with a basket.
The works of Eugene Sue, Gutzkow,
and like spirits fell into the basket.</p>

<p>"All to the fire!" commanded Herr
Frank.</p>

<p>The doctor had compared bad literature
to poisonous food. The comparison
was not inapt; at least, it gave
Richard the appearance of a man in
whose body destructive poison was
working. He was listless and exhausted;
in walking, his hands hung
heavily by his side. His eyes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
directed to the ground, as if he were
seeking something. If he saw a
snail, he stopped to examine the
crawling creature. He sought to
know why the snail crawls about, and,
to his astonishment, found that the
snail always followed an object;
which is not always the case with
man, animal of the moment, who
goes about without an object. If a
caterpillar accidentally got under his
foot, he pushed it carefully aside and
examined if it had been hurt. It
seemed to him logical that creeping
and flying things had the same claims
to forbearance and proper treatment
as man, since according to Vogt and
Büchner's striking proofs, all creeping
and flying things are not essentially
different from man.</p>

<p>He paid particular attention to the
spiders. If he came to a place where
their web was stretched, he examined
attentively the artistic texture; he saw
the firmly fastened knot on the twig
which held the web apart, the circular
meshes, the cunning arrangement
to catch the wandering fly. He was
convinced that such a spider would
be a thousand times more intelligent
than Herr Vogt and Herr Büchner,
with half as big a head as those
wise naturalists. The enterprising
spirit of the ants excited not less his
admiration. He always found them
busy and in a bustle, to which a
market-day could not be compared.
Even London and Paris were solitary
in comparison to the throng in an
ant-hill. They dragged about large
pieces of wood, as also leaves and
fibres, to construct their house, which
was laid out with design and finished
with much care. If he pushed his
cane into the hill, there forthwith
arose a great revolution. The inhabitants
rushed out upon him, nipped
him with their pincers, and showed
the greatest rage against the invader
of their kingdom, while others with
great celerity placed the eggs in safety.
He observed that the ants gave
no quarter, and considered every one
a mortal enemy who disturbed their
state.</p>

<p>The young man sat on a stone and
examined a snail that crawled slowly
from the wet grass. It carried a gray
house on its back, and beslimed the
way as it went, and stretched out its
horns to discover the best direction.
Its delicate touch astonished Frank.
When obstacles came in its way
which it did not see nor touch, it
would perceive them by means of a
wonderful sensibility.</p>

<p>How stupid did Richard appear to
himself, beside a horned, blind snail.
How many men only discover obstacles
in their way when they have
run their heads against them, and
how many wish to run their heads
through walls without any reason!
He arose and looked toward Angela's
home. He was dejected, and
heaved a sigh.</p>

<p>"All is of no avail. The activity of
the animal world affords no diversion,
the benumbing strokes of materialism
lose their effect. The rare
becomes common, and does not attract
attention. There walks an angel
in the splendor of superior excellence,
and I endeavor in vain to distract
my mind from her by studying
the animals. I follow willingly the
professors' exact investigations, into
the labyrinth of their studied arguments
to make it appear that I am
only an animal, that all our sentiment
is only imagination and fallacy. It
is all in vain. Can these gentlemen
teach me how we can cease to have
admiration for the noble and exalted?
Here man forcibly breaks
through. Here self, irresistible and
disgusted with error, brings the nobility
of human nature to consciousness,
and all the wisdom of boasted
materialism becomes idle nonsense."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank God! I see you again, my
dear neighbor," said Siegwart cordially.
"Where have you kept yourself
this last week? Why do you
no longer visit us? My whole house
is excited about you. Henry is angry
because he cannot show you the
horses he bought lately. My wife
bothers her head with all kinds of forebodings,
and Angela urged me to
send and see if you were ill."</p>

<p>A new life permeated Frank's
whole being at these last words; his
cheeks flushed and his languid eyes
brightened up.</p>

<p>"I know no good reason as an
apology, dear friend. Be assured,
however, that the apparent neglect
does not arise from any coolness toward
you and your esteemed family."
And he drew marks in the sand with
his cane.</p>

<p>"Perhaps your father took offence
at your visits to us?"</p>

<p>"Oh! no. No; I alone am to
blame."</p>

<p>Siegwart gave a searching glance
at the pale face of the young man
who, broken-spirited, stood before him,
and whose mental condition he did
not understand, although he had a
vague idea of it.</p>

<p>"I will not press you further," said
he cheerfully. "But, as a punishment,
you must now come with me.
I received yesterday a fresh supply
of genuine Havanas, and you must
try them."</p>

<p>He took Richard by the arm, and
the latter yielded to the friendly compulsion.
They went through the
vineyard. Frank broke from a twig
a folded leaf.</p>

<p>"Do you know the cause of this?"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes; it is the work of
the vine-weevil," answered Siegwart.
"These mischief-makers sometimes
cause great damage to the vineyards.
Some years I have their nests gathered
and the eggs destroyed to prevent
their doing damage."</p>

<p>"You consider every thing with
the eyes of an economist. But I admire
the art, the foresight, and the intelligence
of these insects."</p>

<p>"Intelligence&mdash;foresight of an insect!"
repeated Siegwart, astonished.
"I see in the whole affair neither intelligence
nor foresight."</p>

<p>"But just look here," said Richard,
carefully unfolding the leaf. "What
a degree of considerate management
is necessary to fix the leaf in such
order. The ribs of this leaf are
stronger than the force of the beetle.
Yet he wished to fold the eggs in it.
What does he do? He first pierces
the stem with his pincers; in consequence
of this, the leaf curls up and
becomes soft and pliable to the frail
feet of the insect. This is the first
act of reflection. The piercing of
the stem had evidently as its object
to cause the leaf to roll up. Then
he begins to work with a perfection
that would do honor to human skill.
The leaf is rolled up in order to put
the eggs in the folds. Here is the
first egg; he rolls further&mdash;here is the
second egg, some distance from the
first, in order to have sufficient food
for the young worm&mdash;again an act
of reflection; lastly, he finishes the
roll with a carefully worked point, to
prevent the leaf from unfolding&mdash;again
an act of reflection."</p>

<p>Siegwart heard all this with indifference.
What Richard told him he
had known for years. His employment
in the fields revealed to his
observing mind wonderful facts in
nature and in the animal world. The
wisdom of the vine-weevil gave him
no difficulty. He looked again in
Frank's deep-sunken eyes and noticed
a peculiar expression, and in his
countenance great anxiety.</p>

<p>He concluded that the work of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
the vine-weevil must have some
connection with the young man's
condition.</p>

<p>"You see actions of reflection and
design where I see only unconscious
instinct."</p>

<p>Frank became nervous.</p>

<p>"The common evasion of superficial
examination!" cried he. "Man
must be just even to the animals.
Their works are artistic, intelligent,
and considerate. Why then deny to
animals those powers which operate
with intelligence and reflection?"</p>

<p>"I do not for a moment dispute
this power of the animals," replied
the proprietor quickly.</p>

<p>"You find mind in the animals?"
interrupted Frank hastily. "This conviction
once reached, have you considered
the consequences that follow?"&mdash;and
he became more excited.
"Have you considered that with
this admission the whole world becomes
a fabulous structure, without
any higher object? If the spider is
equal to man, then its torn web that
flutters in the wind is worth as much
as the crumbling fragments of art
which remain from classic antiquity.
Virtue, the careful restraining of the
passions, is stark madness. The disgusting
ape, lustful and brutish, is as
good as the purest virgin who performs
severe penances for her idle
dreams. It is with justice that the
criminal scoffs at the good as bedlamites
who, with fanatical delusion,
strive for castles in the air. Every
outcast from society, sunk and saturated
in the basest vices, is precisely
as good as the purest soul and the
noblest heart; for all distinction between
right and wrong, good and
evil, is destroyed."</p>

<p>Angela's father gazed with solicitude
into the perplexed look and distorted
countenance of the young
man.</p>

<p>"You deduce consequences, Herr
Frank, that could not be drawn from
my admissions," said he mildly.
"There is no conscious power in
animals&mdash;no reflecting soul. The
animal works with the power that is
in it, as light and heat in the fire, as
in the lightning the destructive force,
as the exciting and purifying effects in
the storm. The animal does not act
freely, like man; but from necessity&mdash;according
to instinct and laws
which the Almighty has imposed
upon it."</p>

<p>"A gratuitous assumption! A shallow
artifice," exclaimed Frank. "The
animal shows understanding, design,
and will; we must not deny him
these faculties."</p>

<p>"If the lightning strikes my house
and discovers with infallible certainty
all the metal in the walls, even where
the sharpest eye could not detect it,
must you recognize mental faculties
in the lightning in discovering the
metal?"</p>

<p>Frank hemmed and was silent.</p>

<p>"What a botcher is the most learned
chemist compared with the root-fibres
of the smallest plant," continued
Siegwart. "Every plant has its
own peculiar life; this I observe every
day. All plants do not flourish
alike in the same soil. They only
flourish where they find the necessary
conditions for their peculiar life;
where they find in the air and earth
the conditions necessary for their existence.
Set ten different kinds of
plants together in a small plat of
ground. The different fibres will always
seek and absorb only that
material in the earth which is proper
to their kind; they will pass by
the useless and injurious substances.
Now, where is the chemist who with
such certainty, such power of discrimination,
and knowledge of substances,
can select from the inert clod the
proper material? A chemist with
such knowledge does not exist. Now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
must you admit that the fibres possess
as keen an understanding and as
deep a knowledge of chemistry as
the man who is versed in chemistry?"</p>

<p>"That would be manifest folly."</p>

<p>"Well," concluded Siegwart quietly,
"if the vine-weevil weaves its
wrapper, the spider its web, the bird
builds its nest, and the beaver his
house, they all do it in their way, as
the root-fibres in theirs."</p>

<p>Richard remained silent, and they
passed into the house.</p>

<p>Angela and her mother looked
with astonishment and sympathy on
their friend.</p>

<p>Soon in the mild countenance
of Madam Siegwart there appeared
nearly the same expression as in the
first days after the death of Eliza&mdash;so
much did the painful appearance
of the young man afflict her. Angela
turned pale, her eyes filled, and she
strove to hide her emotion. Frank
only looked at her furtively. Whatever
he had to say to her, he said
with averted eyes. Siegwart expended
all his powers of amusement; but
he did not succeed in cheering the
young man. He continued depressed,
embarrassed, and sad, and constantly
avoided looking at Angela.
When she spoke he listened to the
sound of her voice, but avoided her
look. Presently a low barking was
heard in the room and Hector, who
had growlingly received Frank at his
first visit, but who in time had become
an acquaintance of his, lay
stretched at full length dreaming.
Scarcely did Richard notice the
dreaming animal when he exclaimed,</p>

<p>"The dog dreams! See how his
feet move in the chase, how he opens
his nostrils, how he barks, how his
limbs reach for the game! The dog
dreams he is in the chase."</p>

<p>"I have often observed Hector's
dreams," said Siegwart coolly.</p>

<p>Frank continued,</p>

<p>"Have you considered the consequences
that follow from the dreams
of the dog? Dreams show a thinking
faculty," said he hastily. "Animals,
then, think like men; thoughts
are the children of the mind; therefore,
animals have minds. Animals
and men are alike."</p>

<p>Angela started at these words.
Her mother shook her head.</p>

<p>"You conclude too hastily, my
dear friend," said Siegwart coolly.
"You must first <em>know</em> that animals
dream like men. Men think, reflect,
and speak in dreams. The dreams
of animals are very different from
those mental acts."</p>

<p>"How will you explain it?" said
Richard excitedly.</p>

<p>"Very easily. Hector is now in
the chase. The dog's sense of smell
is remarkable. By means of the fragrant
wind Hector smells the partridges
miles away. He acts then just
as in the dream; feet, nose, and limbs
come into activity. Suppose that in
the surrounding fields there is a covey
of partridges. The air would indicate
them to Hector's smelling organs;
these organs act, as in the waking
state, on the brain of the animal;
the brain acts on the other organs.
Where is there thought? Have we
not a purely material effect? The
cough, the appetite, the sneezing, the
aversion&mdash;what have all these to do
with mind or thought? Nothing at
all. The dream of the dog is an entirely
muscular process, the mere co-working
of the muscular organs; as
with us, digestion, the flowing of the
blood, the twitching of the muscles&mdash;facts
with which the mind has nothing
to do."</p>

<p>"Your assertion is based on the
assumption that partridges are near,"
said Richard; "and I will be obliged
to you if, with Hector's assistance,
you convince me of this fact."</p>

<p>"That is unnecessary, my dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
friend. Suppose there are no partridges
in the neighborhood. The
same affection of the brain which
would be produced by the smell of
the partridges could be produced by
accident. If it is accidental, it will
have the same effect in the sleeping
condition of the dog.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
Affections
accidentally arise in man the
causes of which are not known. We
are uneasy, we know not why; we
are discouraged without any knowledge
of the cause. We are joyful
without being able to give any reason
for it. The mind can rise above
all these dispositions, affections, and
humors; can govern, cast out, and
disperse them. Proof enough that a
king lives in man&mdash;the breath of
God, which is not taken from the
earth, and to which all matter must
yield if that power so wills."</p>

<p>The dog stretched his strong legs
without any idea of the important
question to which he had given occasion.</p>

<p>"Herr Frank," began Madam
Siegwart earnestly, "I have learned
to respect you, and have often wished
that my son, at your years, would be
like you. I see now with painful astonishment
that you defend opinions
which contradict your former expressions,
and the sentiments we must
expect from a Christian. Will you
not be so good as to tell me how
you have so suddenly changed your
views?"</p>

<p>"Esteemed madam," answered
Frank, with emotion, "I thank you
for this undeserved motherly sympathy;
but I beg of you not to believe
that the opinions I expressed are my
firm convictions. No, I have not yet
fallen so deep that for me there is no
difference between man and beast. I
can yet continue to believe that materialism
is a crime against mankind.
On the other hand, I freely acknowledge
that my mind is in great trouble;
that every firm position beneath my
feet totters; that I have been tempted
to hold doctrines degrading to the individual
and destructive to society.
I have been brought into this difficulty
by reading books whose seductive
proofs I am not able to refute.
Oh! I am miserable, very miserable;
my appearance must have shown you
that already."</p>

<p>He looked involuntarily at Angela;
he saw tears in her eyes; he bowed his
head and was silent.</p>

<p>"I see your difficulties," said the
proprietor. "They enter early or
late into the mind of every man. It
is good, in such uncertainties and
doubts, to lean on the authority of
truth. This authority can only be
God, who is truth itself, who came
down from heaven and brought light
into the darkness. We can prove,
inquire, and speculate; but the keenest
human intellect is not always free
from delusion. As there is in man a
spiritual tendency which raises him
far above the visible and material,
God has been pleased to lead and direct
that tendency by revelation, that
man may not err. I consider divine
revelation a necessity which God
willed when he created the mind.
As the mind has an instinctive thirst
after truth, God must, by the revelation
of truth, satisfy this thirst.
Therefore is revelation as old as the
human race. It reached its completion
and perfection by the coming of
the Lord, who said, 'I am the truth;'
and this knowledge of the truth remains
in the church through the
guidance of the Spirit of truth, till the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
latest generation. This is only my
ultramontane conviction," said Siegwart,
smiling; "but it affords peace
and certainty."</p>

<p>Angela had gone out, and now returned
with a basket, in which lay a
little dog, of a few days old, asleep.
She set the basket carefully down before
Frank, so as not to awaken the
sleeper.</p>

<p>"As you appreciate the full worth
of striking proofs, I am glad to be
able to place one before you, in the
shape of this little dog," said she, appearing
desirous of cheering her dejected
friend. But Frank did not receive
from her cheerful countenance
either strength or encouragement, for
he did not look up.</p>

<p>"This little dog is only eight days
old," she continued; "its eyes are not
yet open; it can neither walk nor
bark; it can only growl a little; and it
does nothing but sleep and dream. I
have noticed its dreams since the
first day of its birth. You can convince
yourself of its dreaming." She
stooped over the basket and her soft
hair disturbed the sleeper.</p>

<p>For a moment Frank saw and
heard nothing.</p>

<p>"See," she continued, "how its
little feet move, and how its body
jerks. Hear the low growl, and see
the hairs round the mouth how they
twitch, how the nose shrinks and
expands&mdash;all the same as in Hector.
The little thing knows nothing at all
of the world&mdash;no more than a child
eight days old. We certainly, therefore,
will not deceive ourselves in assuming
that all these movements are
only muscular twitchings; that neither
the pup nor Hector dreams like a
man."</p>

<p>Frank first looked at the dog in
great surprise, and then gazed admiringly
on Angela.</p>

<p>"O fraulein! how I thank you."</p>

<p>She appeared most lovely in his
eyes. He suddenly turned toward her
father.</p>

<p>"Your house is a great blessing to
me. It appears that the pure atmosphere
of religious conviction which
you breathe victoriously combats all
dark doubts, as light dissipates darkness."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Angela stood in her room. She
knew that the spirit of unbelief pervaded
the world, taking possession
of thousands and destroying all life
and effort. She saw Richard threatened
by this spirit, and feared for his
soul. She became very anxious, and
sank on her knees before the crucifix
and cried to heaven for succor.</p>

<p>Night was upon all things. The
black clouds, lowering deep and
heavy, shut out all light from heaven.
The wind swept the mountains, the forest
moaned, and thunder muttered in
the distance. Klingenberg sat before
his folios. A fitful light glimmered
from the room of Richard's father.
Richard himself came home late,
took his supper, and retired to his
chamber; there he walked back and
forth, thinking, contending with himself,
and speaking aloud. Before his
door stood a dark figure&mdash;immovable
and listening.</p>

<p>It knocked at the door of the
elder Frank. Jacob, a servant who
had grown gray in the service of the
house, entered. Frank received him
with surprise, and awaited expectantly
what he had to say.</p>

<p>"We are all wrong," said Jacob.
"My poor young master has now
spoken out clearly. He is not sick
because of the foolish trash in the
books. He is in love, terribly in
love."</p>

<p>"Ah! in love?" said Herr Frank.</p>

<p>"You should just have heard how
he complains and laments that he is
not worthy of her. 'O Angela, Angela!'
he cried at least a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
times, 'could I only raise myself to
your level and make myself worthy!
But your soul, so pure, your character,
so immaculate and good, thrusts
me away. I look up to you with
admiration and longing, as the troubled
pilgrim on earth looks up to
the peace and grandeur of heaven.'
This is the way he talked. He is to
be pitied, sir."</p>

<p>"So&mdash;so&mdash;in love, and with Siegwart's
daughter," said Frank sadly.
"The tragedy will change into comedy.
Even if they were not so unapproachably
high, but like other people
on earth, my son should never
take an ultramontane wife."</p>

<p>"But if he loves her so deeply,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Be still; you know nothing about
it. Has he lain down?"</p>

<p>"Yes; or, at least, he is quiet."</p>

<p>"Continue to watch him. I must
immediately make known to the doctor
this love affair. He will be surprised
to find the philosopher changed
into a love-sick visionary."</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY NOTE.</h3>

<p>The <cite>Dublin Review</cite> has recently
commenced a series of articles with
the view of promoting philosophical
unity among Catholic scholars, and
of urging upon them the necessity
of a combined effort against modern
scepticism. We are very glad that
Dr. Ward has turned the powerful
stream of his great literary engine in
this direction. We are in perfect accord
with him on this point, that false
philosophy lies at the foundation of
all the worst errors of the day, and
that these errors can only be effectually
subverted by a true and sound
philosophy. We desire, therefore, as
we have always desired and endeavored,
to do what we can in this
magazine, both to promote agreement
among Catholics in sound philosophical
principles, and to refute those
false principles in modern times so
generally adopted, which are better
designated by the term pure psychologism
than by any other name that
we know of. We desire to make it
clearly known, however, that by this
term we intend only to designate the
philosophical doctrine of Des Cartes,
and that which constitutes the primary
principle of the systems of Locke,
Hamilton, Mansel, Mill, Kant, Spencer,
and other uncatholic writers. We
call it pure psychologism, because it
acknowledges no other first principle
of thought and reason than the consciousness
which the thinking subject
has or seems to have of itself under
various phases or modifications. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
do not apply the term to any recognized
school of Catholic philosophy,
or to the system of any respectable
author whose works are in good repute
in the church, and we believe
that there is no one among them who
would not repudiate the epithet if applied
to his doctrine by an opponent.
In the sense in which we have defined
it, it is the heresy of nominalism
carried to its utmost logical consequences&mdash;that
is, to complete subjecticism
or scepticism in the order of
pure reason. Opposed to it is the
realism sustained in theology by
every orthodox writer, and in philosophy
by every one whose philosophy
is not in direct contradiction to his
theology. This realism is the affirmation
of the objective entity, distinct
from and superior to the thinking
subject of that which reason immediately
apprehends as intelligible,
necessary, self-evident, universal idea,
together with the objective entity of
that which is perceived as existing
under sensible phenomena. It is the
denial or doubt of this objective reality
which nullifies the effect of all reasoning
from principles or from evidence
in proof of Catholic dogmas.
We meet with a scepticism in regard
to the real existence of God, of truth,
of the external world, of the soul itself,
which renders logic vain. It is
only a return to first principles and to
a belief in reason, therefore, which
can give us a basis on which to reintegrate
the rights of faith against the
modern irrationalists and misologists&mdash;that
is, haters of reason. The restoration
and improvement of philosophy
is an object of primary importance
to the religious, moral, and political
welfare of the world. It is in
vain to think of looking for this improvement
elsewhere than in the investigation
and development of the
philosophical doctrine of Plato, Aristotle,
the great fathers and doctors
of the church, the scholastic metaphysicians,
and their successors. As
there is no real progress in theological
science except in the continuity
of scholastic theology, so there is
none in metaphysical science except
in the continuity of scholastic philosophy.
As, in theology, all sound
Catholic authors work together harmoniously
in defending and propugnating
those essential doctrines which
are clearly defined and universally admitted,
at the same time discussing
among themselves in a friendly manner
those opinions which are as yet
only probable, so it should be in philosophy.
The most important thing
is to maintain that philosophical truth
in which all sound Catholic authors
are agreed against the sceptical principles
of modern sophists. Advance
in the science of this truth; with that
increase of clearness in conception
and statement, and of unanimity in
opinion, which is its natural consequence;
can only be gained by exhaustive
study and argumentation of
obscure and disputed questions, carried
on in a truly catholic, impartial,
and conciliatory spirit.</p>

<p>The author of the article before us
was one who labored most zealously
in this direction. He was a learned
Barnabite monk, occupying a high
position among the erudite scholars
of the Roman court and schools.
He held the position of consultor to
one of the Roman congregations, and
was a member of the commission on
oriental affairs, preparatory to the
Council of the Vatican, at the time
of his decease. The present essay
was read before the Academy of the
Catholic Religion at Rome, on the
27th of August, 1863, and published
by the Propaganda press. We have
taken it from an edition of F. Vercellone's
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Dissertazioni Accademiche di Vario
Argomento</i>, published at Rome in
1864, and dedicated to Cardinal De<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
Luca. There can be no doubt of F.
Vercellone's competency to discriminate
in philosophical matters between
the doctrine prescribed by authority,
and that which rests only on the judgment
of eminent schools and authors,
and on the arguments by which this
judgment is supported. His position
gave him unusual facilities for understanding
the reason and true import
of the judgments pronounced
by the holy see on philosophical
questions, so that whatever he has
written with a bearing on points
which have been a subject of controversy
among Catholic writers must
have the greatest weight, and be entitled,
at least, to be considered as safe
opinion. For this reason, as well as
for the intrinsic value it possesses, we
have thought the essay now presented
to the readers of <span class="smcap">The Catholic
World</span> to be especially worthy of
translation into English, and of careful
study by all who are interested in
the advancement of sound philosophy.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.

<h3>DISSERTATION.</h3>

<p>In contradiction to that most
grave and deplorable error by which
many unbelievers of our own day,
more than those of an earlier period,
love to confound religion with philosophy,
we firmly hold the principle
which was efficaciously and unanimously
sustained by the ancient sages,
pagan as well as Christian, that
religion is the chief end to which
philosophy is directed. If this were
not so, we should never have seen
what forms one of the chief glories
of the holy church. I mean, that the
eagle of all human philosophy, the
incomparable Augustine, claims the
first and most glorious place among
the renowned and venerable company
of the holy fathers; I mean, that to
the holy fathers generally belongs the
merit of having initiated the whole
Christian world into a philosophy
much more severe, more legitimate,
and more conclusive than that which
was previously a most rare privilege,
one, also, more or less temporary and
successive, of Cortona, of Elea, of
Athens, of Alexandria, and of some
other cities; so that not a few of
these fathers have left us, in their
works, an immense harvest for the
benefit of philosophy, partly the fruit
of their own genius and thought on
various topics, partly in the form of
precious monuments of that admirable
wisdom of more ancient times
which was itself, as it existed among
the heathen, not altogether free from
the influence of the true religion, and
therefore descended by a just title of
inheritance to Christianity. And if
philosophy revived and arose from
its ashes two centuries, at least, before
our language and literature, as this
preceded by several hundred years
those of foreign nations, to whom
does the praise more justly belong
than to the renowned Benedictine of
Aosta, a man whose genius and metaphysical
power equalled his sanctity?
If, besides, the philosophy of Aristotle
was exhibited to the world in a Christian
form&mdash;that is, purified, completed,
rigorous, true, irrefutable, as Augustine
and the other fathers had done
to the Platonic wisdom&mdash;to whom belongs
the merit but to a seraphic cardinal
and an angelical Dominican?
Perhaps the modern depreciators of
scholasticism, the chief enemies of the
Catholic clergy, the persecutors of
religious orders, have on their side
philosophers worthy to be compared
with an Anselm, a Bonaventure, a
Thomas? Whoever has received
from God the grace of appertaining
to the Catholic Church can easily
see, with his own eyes, if he is not
altogether a faster in science, how
many and great services the true religion
renders to philosophy; by simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
opening at random any one of the
sacred and precious volumes, either
of the illustrious ancient fathers or of
the venerable princes of the schools.
But those of us who are honored by
the privilege of representing in the
chairs of instruction, or cultivating
and illustrating in books the Catholic
philosophy, have far greater reason
to know and esteem the masterpieces
of the doctors and the fathers. Such
can see, by contrast with these, that
what is called the modern philosophy,
although sustained and kept on foot,
here and there, by some authors of
unusual and vast speculative ability,
nevertheless never satisfies in the
least any one who attempts to revive
it, always lacking a valid direction,
always liable to sudden changes and
vacillations&mdash;a sure sign of internal
contradiction&mdash;agitated, discomposed,
tormented by all the follies of the
most mediocre and turbulent intellects.
Such persons as these, not observing
that logic (permit me here
to use the language of St. Augustine)
is properly the intellectual judgment
of entire humanity, that it cannot be
made anew, as it cannot either be
unmade, but only obtained by inheritance
and amplified and extended by
felicitous discoveries; not considering,
I say, any of these things, they
believe that out of the present age
there ought to issue a new and magnificent
rational philosophy; just as
there certainly has issued a new and
stupendous literature, a geometry totally
renovated and enlarged to most
gigantic proportions, and a system
of physics in great part constructed
anew, corrected by experiments
and elucidated by better hypotheses.
But I pray and hope that the
time of undeceiving has arrived, and
that the Catholic masters (the others
will turn back when this happens)
will apply themselves in earnest to
pick up again the thread of perfect
and classical tradition in science.
This I come to-day to recommend;
and I have confidence that I can better
persuade men to undertake it by
example, and, as it were, by means
of something actually done, if you,
with your accustomed benignity, will
deign to bear with my proposition,
and to give it the support and weight
of your authority.</p>

<p>I invoke the authority of this respectable
assembly for an end I have
greatly at heart, and which seems to
me of supreme importance both to
scientific advancement and religious
edification; that is, to obtain that our
philosophers, divided, not by their own
fault but by that of our ancestors of
the last century, into ontologists and
psychologists, should once for all give
their attention and open their eyes to
the history too long belied and alone
worthy of consideration&mdash;the history,
I say, ever new, brilliant, and unsurpassable,
of our own philosophy; and
instead of consuming all their strength
in a war among our excellent doctors&mdash;which
it is high time to break off&mdash;should
apply themselves rather to lay
a new grasp on the ancient wisdom
of Catholicism with one hand, and
with the other to repulse and discomfit
the audacious and execrable crowd
of modern errors. Assuredly, when
the doctrine as well of the fathers
relatively to the Platonic system, as
of the greater schoolmen to the metaphysics
of Aristotle, shall have been
first placed in a better light and looked
at in its multiform aspects by means
of various and judicious investigations,
it will be made universally manifest
that the Platonism and Aristotelianism
of the heathen were not in any wise
identical with the ontologism and
psychologism of the Catholic masters;
that the war between the Academics
and Peripatetics was annihilated
and put aside by the rigor and
integrity of Catholic thought; that, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
fine, the Plato of the holy fathers does
not disdain the psychologism of St.
Thomas, and that the Aristotle of the
chief schoolmen does not reject the
ontologism of St. Augustine. Since
this may appear to some as a thing
which is more specious in assertion
than capable of solid proof, I will draw
out that exemplification of it which I
have promised, and will come to facts;
setting forth certain brief considerations
in relation to ideology&mdash;that is
to say, in relation to the most controverted
theme and the most grave
and obstinate question of the modern
schools in rational philosophy, especially
among Catholics. I will describe
and mark out, first, from original testimonies,
the Augustinian conception,
or, indeed, the genesis of his ideology;
in the second place, I will search into
the modern origin of the division between
the ideology of the Catholic ontologists
and that of the psychologists
equally Catholic; finally, I will make
evident how the reconciliation of the
children with the father and of the
modern scission with the ancient unity,
suffices to consolidate the hope of a
peace which all desire, and which, by
combining the forces of our best minds,
may render Catholic philosophy more
harmoniously operative against the better
united forces of the modern enemies
of truth.</p>

<p>A man who in his whole life had
done nothing except to write the twenty-two
books of <i>The City of God</i> ought
justly to be esteemed the first and
most admirable philosopher on the
earth. Never was it better known
or more loudly proclaimed than in
our day, that the philosophy of history
carries off the palm on the field of
human speculations. In recommending,
therefore, the philosophical excellence
of St. Augustine, we can prove
the justice of our opinion by this one
argument, which is by itself sufficient.
Let us compare whatever modern writers
have been able to do in this class
of books with <i>The City of God</i>; if no
work of modern times, can be found
either so original, so extensive, so erudite,
or so profound as <i>The City of God</i>,
written fourteen centuries ago, we
must necessarily agree that a return
to this centre of Catholic wisdom is
the only method of giving impetus and
improvement to philosophical speculations.
But we will not now extend
our search so far as this. I will confine
myself to the eighth book, which
includes a notice and an appreciation of
the different systems of the entire pagan
philosophy, and forms an introduction
to that long and sublime parallel
between natural reason and revelation,
carried on throughout the succeeding
books in a manner equally novel and
splendid, with a view to the illustration
of the whole field of Catholic
theology by the highest efforts of human
wisdom and the best sentiments
of the pagans themselves. The most
vital part of the preliminary views, introducing
the subject of the eighth
and succeeding books, is as follows:</p>

<p>There are two points, he says, which
must be firmly held: that Catholics
ought not to deny that which is good
in the philosophy of the pagans; and
that, on the other hand, they are bound
to reject and refute all the falsehood
contained in it. The first is proved
by that which the apostle says. <i>What
is known</i> of God is manifest <i>in them;
for God has manifested it to them.
For the invisible things of him are
beheld from the constitution of the
world, being understood by means of
those things which are made, even his
eternal power and divinity.</i> Moreover,
at the Areopagus, when he affirmed
that <i>in him we live and move
and are</i>, he added, <i>as some also of
your own poets have said</i>. The second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
is proved by another text. <i>Beware
lest any one deceive you by philosophy
and vain seduction according to the
elements of the world.</i><a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>This being laid down, the duty of
Catholic philosophers is that already
touched upon&mdash;the separation of the
good gold in pagan philosophy
from the counterfeit; and as all the philosophy
is divided into three parts,
<i>natural, rational, and moral</i>, "we
shall hold," continues St. Augustine,
"that natural philosophy for false
which does not place God as the
only principle and true creator of all
other natures; we shall hold as false
that rational philosophy which does
not maintain that God alone is the
intelligible reason of all minds; we
shall repute as false that moral which
does not prove that God alone is
that good which is worthy to be the
end of a virtuous and perfect course
of life." Now, the great multitude
of pagan philosophers was far distant
from any recognition or profession
of the three heads we have given;
scarcely was there a small number of
privileged persons among the disciples,
I hardly know whether to say in preference
of Plato or of Pythagoras,
who made any near approach to Catholic
truth, aided, in all probability,
by some knowledge of Jewish traditions.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"No one having even a slight knowledge
of these things is ignorant that there are
those philosophers called Platonists, from
their master, Plato."(1) "Perhaps those
who enjoy the greatest celebrity as having
the most clearly understood, and the most
closely followed Plato, who is with justice
esteemed to be far superior to the other
philosophers of the Gentiles, hold a similar
opinion concerning God, namely, that in
him is found the cause of subsistence, and
the reason of intelligence, and the regulating
principle of life."(2) "If, therefore,
Plato has said that the wise man is one who
is an imitator, a knower, and a lover of the
one true and supremely good God, by a
participation with whom he is blessed, what
need is there of discussing the rest?"(3)
"This is, therefore, the reason why
we prefer these to the others; because
while other philosophers have employed
their talents and efforts in searching out the
causes of things, and what is the method
of learning and living, these, having the
knowledge of God, have found where is
the cause of the constitution of the universe,
and the light of perceptible truth,
and the fountain whence we may drink felicity."(4)
"All those philosophers who
have held these opinions concerning the
true and supreme God, that he is the framer
of those things which are created, and
the light of those things which are knowable,
and the good of those things which
ought to be done, whether they are more
properly called Platonists, Ionics, or Italics,
on account of Pythagoras, we prefer to the
others, and regard them as nearer to ourselves."(5)<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It is very necessary, he says, to
exclude all merely verbal questions,
since it is of things not words that
he is treating. I wish to demonstrate
that the philosophy of the pagans,
when it is good and true, accords
wonderfully with Catholic truth, and
gives rise naturally to Catholic philosophy&mdash;that
is to say, the principal
and most excellent philosophy of
mankind; similarly, I wish to demonstrate
that, in so far as the pagan
philosophy is in discordance and
repugnance to Catholic truth, it is
false, corrupt, and in need of better
and more rational emendations.</p>

<p>No one, certainly, will exact of
me that I make a minute examination
of the innumerable and varying
systems or opinions of pagan antiquity;
it is enough that I prove my
proposition by confining myself to
the best philosophy of all paganism.
If I make good my assertion respecting
the best system of doctrine which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
ever appeared in Gentile philosophy,
it will be evident enough that the
same assertion holds even more
strongly in reference to other systems,
more or less inferior to this one.
But this is certain, that gentilism had
no philosophy worthy to be compared,
much less preferred, to the doctrine
of those authors who acknowledged,
and, in the best manner of which they
were capable, proclaimed the existence
of one only supreme and true
God, "from whom we derive the principle
of our nature, the truth of our
knowledge, and the happiness of our
life."<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
I turn, therefore, to these authors
with the purpose of examining what
is good and what is bad in them;
"but I find it more suitable to discuss
this subject with the Platonists, because
their writings are better known;
for not only the Greeks, whose language
is preëminent among the nations,
have made them celebrated by greatly
extolling their excellence; but the
Latins also, moved by their excellence
or their renown, have studied
them with greater ardor than any
others, and by translating them into
our language have made them still
more famous and renowned."<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>From all this, not a few consequences,
whose value you above all others
are able to judge and appreciate,
are immediately deduced with a clearness
greater even than we could desire.
The first is, that the noblest
and greatest problem of modern philosophy,
to wit, that the protological
and encyclopædic principle cannot be
placed elsewhere than in the principle
of creation, understood in conformity
with the tradition of the Catholic
Church; this principle, I say,
was stated and solved amply, doubly,
irrefutably, by St. Augustine; first, in
his <i>Soliloquies</i>, where one by one the
partial principles of all the sciences
are recovered; secondly, in this eighth
book of <i>The City of God</i>, where the
one only rule is laid hold of and exhibited
by which to distinguish the
only true system among various and
opposite philosophical systems. The
second consequence is, that those
persons must cover their eyes with
both hands who will not see and admit
that St. Augustine preferred the
Platonic doctrine, and specifically
preferred the Platonic or Pythagorean
ideology, in the clearest terms in
which it was possible for him to express
his meaning. The third is, that
St. Augustine not only derived his
ideology from the very principle of
creation, in the way of an inference
more or less remote; but held it,
rather, as an integral part of the
principle itself, and made of it a second
cycle, one lying between the
first, which respects the origin of substances,
and the third, which assigns
the good of operations. The final
consequence is, that this second cycle,
relating to rational intelligence,
has been passed over by the moderns;
which may serve as a useful
admonition to them, to convince
them thoroughly that no one can
take St. Augustine's place in philosophy;
that modern philosophy, with
all its power, lags very far behind the
Augustinian speculations, and that if
all other books are understood and
studied to the neglect of St. Augustine,
this will turn not to his disadvantage
but to ours. Thus we see,
by a most striking example, that he
alone not only saved, by the principle
of creation, physics and ethics;
but moreover, by that middle cycle,
which is as it were central to the
other two, saved rational philosophy,
without which the other two result
less necessarily, and, so to speak, revert
back to nullity.</p>

<p>The first of the consequences
above enumerated was noted by me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
in this place many years ago; and
has been better exhibited for the
benefit of science by the illustrious
F. Milone in his book entitled, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">La
Scuola di Filosofia Razionale Intitolata
a S. Augustino</i>; wherefore I will
abstain from considering it any further
at present. I will restrict myself on
this occasion to taking advantage of
the other consequences which follow
to a marvel from the ideology, but
especially from the genesis of the
ideology of St. Augustine. Indeed
we have a great number of authors,
beginning with the most exalted of
all, that is, the seraphic and angelic
doctors, and terminating with writers
who are still living in Italy, France,
and Belgium, who have collected
from the Augustinian writings a most
extensive list of disputed questions
concerning ideology and human
knowledge; but, above all, we have
two more remarkable collections in
the works of those two fathers of the
Oratory of France, who are equal to
any in learning and merit&mdash;Thomassin
and Martin.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
That which may
perhaps have something new and
original in it, in our own investigation,
is the more exact indication
of the primitive fountain and source
whence these large streams take their
issue; that source, namely, from
which St. Augustine derived the logical
moment of that ideology which
he bases, constructs, and amplifies
with such great strength; which was
the concept, original with him, of that
most vast and sublime theory of human
cognitions formed by him alone.
It appears to me that I have made it
clear to all, from those things which
have been laid down and the testimonies
adduced, that St. Augustine
concentrates and hinges the three
branches of the natural encyclopædia
in one sole principle unfolded in three
members: the principle being that
of creation; the three members being
physics, logic, and ethics; which are
respectively the sole cause of existence,
the sole light of knowledge,
the sole end of virtue. From this
every one can see and touch with the
hand that St. Augustine found his
ideology in the principle of creation,
regarded it as a part of the principle
of creation, distinguished it from the
two extreme cycles, and from the two
opposite members of the principle
of creation. If any one had denied
the ideology of St. Augustine in his
time, St. Augustine would have been
bound to say that such a person
denied the principle of creation; if
some one else had vaunted a contrary
system of ideology, he would have
been bound to judge that system to
be contrary to the principle of creation;
if any one had demanded from
St. Augustine the substantial formula
of his ideology, the origin of that ideology,
or the proofs of the stability,
security, and irrefutable validity of
that ideology, he would always have
been obliged to answer by appealing
to the universal principle established
by reason and the Catholic faith,
that is, to the principle of creation.
Therefore the genesis of the Augustinian
ideology, if it had not been already
traced out or properly considered
before to-day, would be now as
clear and certain as the light, and
with the eighth book of <i>The City of
God</i>, we might predict that it would be
immortal.</p>

<p>In scientific themes a twofold labor
must be undergone; on the one
hand, in ascertaining, and in elucidating
on the other, the matters to be
treated of; and the one who must
apply himself rigorously to one part
of this is rarely able at the same
time to attend to the other. This
is the case with myself; for, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
been obliged to point out the
seat and position of the Augustinian
ideology in that encyclopædic
principle which I have above defined,
I could not bring forward the
second cycle except as implicated
and restricted by the other two, the
first and third. I am glad to be
able now to supply, at least partially,
this defect, by alleging one quite
peculiar testimony, which, fortunately,
leaves in the background the two
cycles with which we are not concerned,
and brings forward with admirable
distinctness the one which
specially concerns us in ideology.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Now, those authors whom we with justice
prefer to all others," (says St. Augustine,
speaking of the Platonists, Pythagoreans,
and others of the best stamp,) "have
distinguished those things which are perceived
by the mind from those which are
attained by the sense; not taking from the
senses those things for which they have a
capacity, or granting to them what is beyond
their capacity. But the light of minds
by which all things are learned [see here
clearly the second cycle] they affirmed to be
God himself, by whom all things were made."</p></blockquote>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lumen autem mentium esse dixerunt ad
discenda omnia eumdem ipsum Deum a
quo facta sunt omnia.</i><a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
The principle
of creation, then, in so far regards
our rational intelligence as it places
on the one hand the sensible perception
we have of it, and on the other
the intelligence which we have in
addition as our great prerogative.
Rational cognition comes from the
conjunction of intellect with sensibility;
and therefore the greater part of
the ancient philosophers, grossly taking
our cognition for an act tied to
a mere sensible perception, and badly
mixing up sense with intellect and
the sensible with the intelligible, knew
little or nothing of the contra-position
of the one to the other. Some of
them, giving every thing to the sensible,
fell into Epicureanism, into materialism,
into atheism, denying God,
and thus the principle of creation; others,
paying attention only to the intelligible,
rushed into fatalism and pantheism,
denying created substances, and
thus again the principle of creation.
These are the philosophers whom we
Catholics cannot prefer to the others;
whom St. Augustine says, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non prodest
excutere</i>, it is lost time to discuss
them. But those, on the contrary,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quos merito ceteris anteponimus</i>, began
from a fundamental distinction between
the intelligible and the sensible,
and therefore also between the
intelligence and the sensibility; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">discreverunt
ea quæ mente conspiciuntur
ab eis quæ sensibus attinguntur</i>; nor
did they take away from the senses
their proper office and necessary value
in the act of defending as their
principal aim the intelligence, which
is so true that they regarded rational
cognition as a sort of marriage, and a
true coöperation, of the mind with the
senses. If, then, concludes the most
glorious father of Catholic philosophy,
the best sages of antiquity, and
we with them admit and give value
to the sensibility, that is necessary in
order to maintain the principle of
creation, since otherwise all the substances
created by God, which are
sensible natures, disappear. Likewise
if the same sages, and we as
much as or even more than they, admit
and defend intelligence, this is of
equal if not greater necessity, in order
to keep the same principle of creation.
In fact, with the sensibility alone, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non
est discere</i>, we can learn nothing,
as the brutes, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">certo nusquam discunt</i>
certainly never learn any thing;
but only minds endowed with intelligence,
who have as a light <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad discenda
omnia, eumdem ipsum Deum a quo
facta sunt omnia</i>&mdash;as a light for
learning all things, that same God
himself who created all things.
Since, therefore, by the principle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
creation, God is the only light of all
minds, so, by denying to minds that
divine, creative light, all rational intelligence
is denied, and the principle
of creation is totally destroyed, just
as much as by taking away all substances.</p>

<p>But perhaps some one of you, considering
that St. Augustine had been
instructed in the Platonic doctrine,
as we read in the <i>Summa</i> of Aquinas,
will remain doubtful whether the
genesis which I have traced out is
not that of the Platonic or Pythagorean
ideology, whichever we may
choose to call it, rather than of the
Augustinian. I think that I have in
the preceding portion of this dissertation
cited from the original texts
enough of St. Augustine's own expressions,
which always revert to these
constant formulas, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">qui nobiscum sentiunt,
quos merito ceteris anteponimus</i>,
to render it certainly and for ever
incontestable that in these passages
it is St. Augustine who <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cum istis
sentit</i>; it is he who <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hos ceteris anteponit</i>;
and by consequence he it is
who embraces, explains, and defends
the Platonic ideology, amending
it where it sins, and supplying to it
what it lacks. But, conceding that
there is a difficulty here in our way,
corroborated by an expression of the
angelic doctor, I wish it to be noted
distinctly that I do not resolve it
principally by alleging any solitary
expression whatever of the angel of
the schools himself, but by a series
of formulæ as distinctly marked in
their significance as they are harmoniously
located in the structure of
his thought and of his boundless
learning. Whenever there shall be
for the first time produced a copious
and well-arranged history of our philosophy,
we shall see among other
things relating to that most glorious
Aquinas, a fact which gives lustre to
his works, and is a memorable one
in human philosophy; and the fact,
which is one completely manifest and
palpable, is this, that while he pays
so little deference to the Platonic
philosophy, while he habitually interprets
the ideas of Plato only in the
sense ascribed to them by Aristotle
and other philosophers, the most hostile
to him; while, consequently, he
does not notice the Platonic ideology
except to reject and confute it, he
nevertheless gives us to understand,
and professes a hundred times, that
he has nothing to oppose to the ideology
of St. Augustine; that he agrees
that it is not the secondary truths
which serve as the rule of our judgments,
but rather the one only and
primary truth which is the divine
light and God himself; that he agrees
that our soul is an image of God
principally by the intelligence which
we possess, into which the light of
that first and one truth falling produces
there an image of the intelligible
things, as like as possible in the spiritual
order to that figure which bodies
cast upon a mirror by virtue of
the exterior material light; that he
agrees that our intellect is like wax
which receives the impression of the
primary truth as if from a seal; that
he agrees that those universals from
which metaphysics works under the
form of principles, mathematics under
the form of axioms, morals under the
form of unchangeable, imperishable
laws, these universals, (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">questi generali</i>,)
I say, and nothing else, St. Thomas
admits to be eternal, in the eternal
light of the eternal truth, which is
the light of the divine intelligence.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
Is there any great need of certifying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
that these formulæ to which St. Thomas
agrees are not a single one of
them taken from Aristotle, but are
without exception taken from St. Augustine
himself? Therefore St. Thomas,
who had to treat the ideology
of Plato, as it was presented to him,
as absurd, sustains and honors as
much as we could wish the Augustinian
ideology; that is to say, he
makes Augustinian and not Platonic
the ideology of the eighth book of
<i>The City of God</i>.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>What should hinder us from passing
for an instant to those other
books altogether similar to this one,
<i>Of the Trinity</i>, <i>Of the Literal Interpretation
of Genesis</i>, and the <i>Confessions</i>?
The last five books of <i>The Trinity</i>
are, indeed, a complete ideology which
for novelty, sublimity, insight, and
scientific force cannot be equalled in
the whole range of human science.
I will cite only one passage, however,
which amid so many others is especially
noteworthy, that one, namely,
in which Augustine protects and defends,
(who would believe it?) against
Plato himself, that ideology which is
nowadays called Platonic. Here it
may be seen in express words.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Plato, that noble philosopher, ... related
that a certain boy who was asked some
questions, I know not precisely what, in
geometry, answered like a person extremely
skilled in that branch of study; whence he
attempted to prove that the souls of men
have lived here before they were in their
present bodies.... But we ought rather
to believe that the nature of the intellectual
mind was so created that, being naturally
coördinated by the Creator to intelligible
things, it sees them in a certain incorporeal
light <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui generis</i>, in the same way that the
bodily eye sees those things which are circumjacent
to it in this corporeal light for
which it has been created with a natural capacity
and congruity."<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This passage being only an incident
in connection with the whole
context, we find him saying a little
above that this incorporeal light is
nothing else than the truth; that
these intelligible things are the eternal
reasons, and a little below, that
this light and these things are "something
eternal and unchangeable;"
that our soul is made naturally in the
image of God, inasmuch as "it can
use reason and intelligence to know
and form a conception of God," and
as noted in another place, "although
the mind is not of the same nature
with God, nevertheless the image of
that nature which is more perfect
than any other must be sought and
found in that part of our nature
which is more perfect than any other."<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>Joining together and recapitulating
all this in the <i>Confessions</i>, he says
in formal terms:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Behold how much I have wandered
about in my memory seeking thee, O Lord!
and I have not found thee outside of it;
... for where I have found the truth,
there I have found my God, the truth itself."<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Moreover, in those most stupendous
books of the <i>Literal Interpretation
of Genesis</i>, he undertakes to distinguish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
partitively the vision in the
light of the truth from all the other
manners of vision conceded to the
nature of the human soul, and terminates
with a final contrast which
presents the fundamental opposition
between the intelligent soul and its
intellectual light in these words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Even in that kind of things seen by intellectual
vision, (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">intellectualium visorum</i>,
understand here that which he is wont to
call <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">intellectum rationale</i>,) those which are
seen in the soul itself, as virtues, the contraries
of which are vices, are one thing;
... the light itself by which the soul
is illuminated, so that it is able to see in a
true intellectual apprehension all things either
in itself (rational knowledge) or in that
(intellectual knowledge;) for that indeed is
God himself; but this created existence, although
made rational and intelligent (these
two terms correspond to the two members,
<i>either in itself, or in that</i>) after his image,
when it attempts to gaze upon that light
trembles with weakness, and can do but
little; yet it derives from thence whatever
it does understand according to its ability.
When, therefore, it is rapt into that region,
and, being withdrawn from the senses, is
brought more directly face to face with that
vision, not by any local presence in space,
but in a manner peculiar to itself; it even
sees in a way superior to its ordinary power
that by the aid of which it also sees whatsoever
it does see in itself by understanding."<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The few moments which remain to
me will barely suffice for the briefest
possible exposition of the contrast
between the belligerent ideology of
modern Catholics and the certain
and incontestable ideology founded
by the prince of all our philosophers,
of which I have just given a sketch
in his own words. I feel bound to
say one thing here which has probably
not been attended to, but is nevertheless
not the less true or the less
demonstrable to a wise critical judgment.
However much it is to be lamented
that the modern philosophy
of the Catholic masters, through a
miserable obliviousness of St. Augustine
and St. Thomas, has brought
once more into vogue and patronized
so long, in great measure so blindly
also, the Gentile dispute between the
ideology of Plato and that of Aristotle;
this most obstinate war, more
bitterly waged in our day than ever
before, has no right to be considered
as excusable. Whoever will look a
little into the interior of this matter,
will be persuaded that the great mass
of questions of this kind should rather
be regarded as vain and superfluous,
than as founded on unreasonable
or unjust opinions. The Catholic
ontologists and the Catholic psychologists
sustain one and the same
thing in two contrary parties; but that
which all in common wish to maintain
appears to the members of one party
to be badly comprehended and worse
defined by those of the other. All
say unanimously, We ought to hold
that theory alone as good and perfect
in which is maintained the capital
distinction between God and his
creation; in which is firmly established
the knowledge of God on the one
hand, and that of things created on
the other; in which neither the
reality of the divine nature, which is
the principle of every other reality,
nor the reality of that which is created,
apart from which that principle itself
is no longer such, and all knowledge
is overturned and destroyed
from summit to foundation, is compromised.
This all profess and
maintain. But when it comes to the
definition of a theory sufficient for
such a lofty scope, the one party
divide themselves from the other
through the diverse aspect in which
they regard, on the one side, that
most sublime and universal truth
which they hold as anterior to the
mind, and, on the other side, the multitude
of created natures which are
perceived by the internal or external
sensible faculty. To make my
meaning clearer, there are two points<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
to be made secure in ideology: the
truth by which all things which are
true exist; and the true things which
furnish the argument by which their
principle, that is, the truth, is proved.
The psychologists observe the following
maxim, which is irreprehensible.
It is impossible to prove the existence
of the creator without asserting
and proving the existence of the creation;
since we cannot attain to the
scientific notion of the truth except
by the medium of the knowledge of
actualities. The ontologists contemplate
the matter from another entirely
diverse side, reasoning with equal
evidence in this form. To know a
thing to a certain extent, is to distinguish
to the same extent whether it
be true or false; but we must necessarily
distinguish whether a thing be
true or false by the light of truth&mdash;<em>the
truth, however, is God</em>; therefore,
without an interior and divine light,
neither man nor angel can know any
thing whatsoever. But take care, exclaim
the psychologists, that you do
not by such a method destroy physical
cognition; in fact, if every
thing is known in the truth, which is
eternal and immutable, created things,
which are mutable and temporal, cannot
be known at all. You ought rather
to take much greater care, reply
the ontologists, lest by your mode of
reasoning you deny and destroy metaphysical
cognition; in fact, the universal
cannot be any kind of created
thing, since every creature is completely
individual and particular;
wherefore, it follows, from your statement,
that the universals are nothing
either physically or metaphysically.
The psychologists rejoin by
saying, God in creating things renders
them knowable; therefore, when
we know them, this comes from the
fact that they are thus created&mdash;that
is, precisely knowable. The ontologists
with equal force respond, We
agree entirely that created things are
knowable because they are created;
but since they would not be created
except for the divine action of the
creator, so they would not be any
more knowable except for the divine
action which creates their knowledge
in the human mind; wherefore, in
the same way as the drawing of
a substance from nothing requires
omnipotence, which is entirely from
God, the giving of intelligence to
a created spirit requires the truth,
which is entirely from God, and is
God himself. But, reply again the
psychologists, you are obliged to admit
the reality of the created apart
from the divine reality; therefore,
also, its cognoscibility. And you, reply
the ontologists, ought further to
maintain the contra-position of intelligence
to sensibility. We, who profess
that the intelligibility of things consists
in a divine light, easily secure
the contra-position of intelligence and
sensibility by means of the contra-position
of God and created substances
visible in the creation; whereas,
taking away the divine light, the
creation alone remains to form the
object of the sensibility on one part,
and the object of intelligence on the
other. But in that case it is impossible
to secure one's self scientifically,
logically, demonstratively, as is necessary,
from confounding intellect with
sense, which results&mdash;note it well!&mdash;in
the denial of the creation of man
itself, and the reduction to nullity not
less of revealed religion than of natural
morality.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span></p>
<p>I will not proceed any further, but
will leave it to the historians of Catholic
philosophy to continue, if they
see fit, this chain of parallel arguments,
which describe the whole
cause of combat between the two
great modern schools. The sketch I
have given will, I hope, suffice to
convince you, first of all, of that
which is chiefly commendable, honorable,
and worthy of attention in
this dispute, which, in many other
respects, is so excessively wearisome.
I have demonstrated that the two
contrary parties look toward one and
the same end&mdash;which is, to make valid
in ideology the Catholic principle of
creation; that both govern themselves
by the same criterion&mdash;which is, the
genuine and Catholic interpretation
of the principle of creation, more or
less known naturally, and perfectly
defined in Catholic doctrine. All
this is due to the praise of the two
schools, and to the glory of that philosophy
to which both pride themselves
in belonging. This, however,
would go but a little way toward the
attainment of that peace at the present
day so necessary, and always
so desirable. Since, therefore, all
truths are in agreement with each
other, and are harmoniously united
in one only and self-same truth, I
have consequently wished to demonstrate
by actual proofs that, aside
from human weakness and the errors
of certain teachers on both sides, the
living and substantial arguments on
either side which are brought forward
in an opposite sense are not
really opposed to each other, being
drawn from the difference of terms,
and the fact that they apprehend and
contemplate from opposite sides that
truth which is, above all others, universal
and comprehensive in the principle
common to both parties. This
consideration, most powerful for promoting
the peace we all desire and
recommend, ought so much the more
to be held as good and sound, as the
Augustinian formula in which all the
force of Catholic philosophy is concentrated
with the most luminous
evidence, appears divided into two
parts, and distributed between the
argumentation of the two opposite
schools. For, while the one sustains
that first clause which forbids to take
away from the senses their proper
capacity&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">neque sensibus adimentes id
quod possunt</i>&mdash;the other stands firmly
by the last clause, which declares
that the light of the mind is God,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lumen autem mentium ad discenda
omnia esse ipsum Deum a quo facta
sunt omnia</i>. But would it not be a
great fault of the ideologists, to whatever
school they might belong, if
they should wilfully dismember and
destroy the organism of Christian protology?
Is it, perhaps, not true that
the Catholic masters of modern psychologism
and ontologism all completely
agree in that maxim, as new in
itself as it is felicitous for the whole
human encyclopædia, and clearly distinct
to us?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The whole discipline of wisdom pertaining
to the instruction of man is the correct
discrimination of the creator from the creation;
the worship of the one as possessing
supreme dominion, and the acknowledgment
of the simple subjection of the other."<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Let us then bring these things
back to their origin, and the philosophers
of our times will recognize that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
they have much the advantage in antiquity
and merit of the philosophers
of another class who are the chiefs
of natural science; the psychologists
will observe that they have a psychological
formation in St. Thomas
against which Catholic ontologism
cannot have any just complaints; on
the other hand, the ontologists will
observe that there is an ontological
form in St. Augustine to which nothing
is wanting of that which Catholic
psychologism can hold as correct.
The time is past for beginning philosophy
over again <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">da capo</i>; whoever
wishes to participate in it, let him
gather it from the most choice, weighty,
and authoritative traditions. That
peace which for so many ages it has
been impossible to conclude, was
already made centuries ago. There
was no ideological dispute, (whoever
maintained that there was?)&mdash;no!
there was only diversity of method of
exposition and of language, between
St. Augustine and his most faithful
disciple, who was in every sense the
Angelical; and this was wrought by
the infinite Providence, so that Catholic
intellect might remake philosophy
twice over by the two opposite
ways, from intelligence to sense, and
from sense to intelligence. It is a
shame to mention the Platonists with
dispraise, when our glory is a Catholic
Plato; it is a vile thing to lose
one's self in reproaches against Aristotle,
after that a Catholic Aristotle has
filled the whole church with the fame
of his wisdom.</p>

<p>The learned Caramuele affirmed
that if that ancient Plato of heathenism
could have seen the Aristotle
who diverged from him so widely,
as St. Thomas re-cast him, corrected
and entirely altered, he would have
been forced to applaud him, and to
declare himself satisfied with him.
Cardinal Sigismund Gerdil announced
and demonstrated<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
that in the
ideology of St. Thomas more than
one principle is encountered wonderfully
conformed to the principles of
St. Augustine. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scuola di Filosofia
Razionale</i> of the excellent F. Milone
is for this reason more precious
and valuable in my eyes, that he,
contrary to Gioberti, who is only one
among numberless others, marks out
a theory of peace between the ontological
and psychological method,
between St. Augustine and St. Thomas.
It is a matter of the most
transparent certainty that, if the ontologism
of Catholic authors is reduced
to a profession of the philosophical
doctrines of St. Augustine, well understood
and better exposed and elucidated,
nothing can be more secure
and more respectable among Catholics
than ontologism; nor is it less
certain and transparent that, if the
psychologism of Catholic authors
turns to a maintenance of the philosophical
doctrines of St. Thomas, well
and symmetrically arranged, and with
fine language reduced to science and
made accessible to our age, nothing
can be more adapted to our time, or
more suitable, or more irreprehensible
than the same psychologism. Let
Catholic philosophers follow the example
of the holy church, who, since
the time of St. Augustine and St.
Thomas, has turned toward no one a
regard more steady and fixed than to
Augustine and Thomas.</p>

<p>In the name of these most authoritative
and most blessed doctors, I
pray for Catholic philosophy the just
and desired tranquillity, which can
only be obtained from a direction
less arbitrary in the selection of questions,
and more capable of embracing
all the grand problems. Ideology
distinguishes naturally between
the objective and the subjective; in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
it the ontologists are accustomed to
establish with sound reasoning the
objectivity of the truth, and likewise
the psychologists the subjectivity of
signs and knowledge. If both the
one and the other desire to become
victors in such a grand combat, let
them make place, as they ought, the
ontologists to larger considerations
respecting the created, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non adimentes
sensibus id quod possunt</i>; and the psychologists
to a greater security of the
intelligibility of things, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non dantes sensibus
ultra quam possunt</i>. Then, the
choice will be free to all to select between
the two opposite methods, and
they can, in respect to that divine
light, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quo illustratur anima</i>, profess
indifferently the original formula of
Catholic ontologism in St. Augustine,
or the imitative exposition of Catholic
psychologism in St. Thomas.
With these peace-makers, so glorious,
so well-deserving, so venerable, it appears
to me that we ought at once
to treat of peace. May these saints
aid from heaven my humble undertaking!</p>

<h2>A HERO, OR A HEROINE?</h2>


<h3>CHAPTER XVI.<br />

GOOD-NIGHT.</h3>

<p>During the latter part of Margaret's
stay at Shellbeach, the doctor
noticed that he never saw her alone;
and as formerly he had observed, with
amusement, Miss Spelman's many admirable
reasons for leaving the room,
he imagined that Miss Lester had
been the cause of the change. "She
wants to prevent my going too far,"
he said to himself; and then with
a rather bitter laugh, "She need not
be afraid." He often met her riding
alone on the Marchioness, or
caught sight of her at sunset on the
beach with her little dog, but they had
very little satisfactory conversation of
any kind together. Once or twice
she made allusions before him to a
"period of importance," or to a "momentous
decision," or to the "turning-point
of her existence," which was at
hand; but it was always as a joke, and
she seemed to enjoy his surprise and
embarrassment.</p>

<p>"She does not want me to forget
July 18th, the date of our absurd
agreement," he said mentally. "What
a fool I was to allow such a nonsensical
arrangement! I wish I were well
out of the scrape."</p>

<p>At last, on the evening of the appointed
day, Miss Spelman gave a
little tea-party and Dr. James was
present. He had resolved that he
would decline; but he was curious to
see what Miss Lester would do and
say, and so, at some inconvenience
to himself, he made his appearance
among the guests. He happened once
to have expressed his dislike to pink
bonnets, and indeed to that color for
any part of a lady's dress; and lo,
on this occasion Margaret came to
meet him, radiantly smiling in rose-colored
muslin, with delicate roses to
match in her hair and on her breast!
It was extremely becoming, the doctor
perceived, and he saw also that
her spirits were at their height. He inwardly
groaned at the prospect of the
evening before him. It was pleasant,
however; even he acknowledged it.
Margaret's mischievous remarks were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
few, and she seemed to have the power
of drawing people out and making
every one appear his best; every one,
the doctor felt, except himself. In vain
he exerted himself to be agreeable and
unconscious; he was grave and preoccupied.
The thought of that dreadful
letter which he had promised to
write that very evening weighed on
his mind, and he was perplexed by
doubts and questions concerning it,
himself, and Miss Lester. Was he
not taking her words too literally?
Had she the remotest idea of writing
to him? or would it not end in his
making an utter fool of himself? No;
never before had she been so handsome,
so gay, so universally kind. Little
Miss Spelman caught the infectious
cordiality, and beamed upon
her guests with overflowing hospitality.</p>

<p>The windows and doors stood open,
the sweet breath of roses was in the
air, and suddenly from the garden
came the sound of instruments. A serenade!
Miss Spelman and every one
looked at each other in surprise, for
the music was not such as was obtainable
in Sealing. But a glance at
Margaret convinced all that she was
the author of this unexpected pleasure.
She said in a low voice to her
aunt, "This is my contribution to the
general festivity;" and it was indeed a
delightful addition. The band played
at intervals through the evening, the
music varying from grave to gay, from
solemn to pathetic.</p>

<p>The Shellbeach tea-parties were early
affairs, and at ten o'clock the guests
reluctantly departed, almost all driving
home to Sealing, and a few from
the neighboring houses walking slowly
along the road, with the sweet notes
of the music still in their ears. Dr.
James lingered. Why, he could not
have told; and it was with a start that,
turning away from the window, he
saw that he was the very last. He
apologized; but Miss Selina coming to
him, kindly took his hand,</p>

<p>"You are a true friend, you know,
Dr. James," she said, "and should
feel yourself at home."</p>

<p>Margaret was at the door, bidding
good-night to the last guests, when
the doctor, after warmly shaking Miss
Spelman's hand, came into the hall
for his hat. She walked with him
down the little path to the front gate,
while the air of the "Last Rose of
Summer" came to them from the garden,
and for the first time that evening
he saw that her face was serious.</p>

<p>"I would like to walk home with
you, in this lovely moonlight," she
said.</p>

<p>"Well, will you not come? I will
gladly accompany you back."</p>

<p>"No; there will not be time. You
forget that you and I have an engagement
at eleven o'clock this evening."
Then, as he did not know how to reply,
she continued, "I shall send you
a note, to-morrow morning, at seven,
and the boy will bring me back, not
an answer, for it will not be that, but
a corresponding note from you."</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Lester, it shall be ready,
if you say so."</p>

<p>"I do. Good night, Dr. James.
Give me your hand; we are friends,
are we not?"</p>

<p>"I believe we are. Yes, Miss Lester,
I know we are friends to-night."</p>

<p>"And we shall be friends to-morrow;
remember that I say so. Good-night."</p>

<p>She leaned on the little gate, and
watched him as he walked away
without once turning back. The music
stopped, and a voice was heard
calling, "Margaret!" She slowly
walked into the house, and, sitting
quietly down by her aunt on the sofa,
told her that Jessie Edgar's marriage
was fixed for the first day of September,
and she was going to Newport,
to be with Jessie till the wedding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, my dear," returned Miss Selina
rather plaintively. "I must not
be selfish; but when do you think of
leaving me?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow."</p>

<p>Poor Miss Spelman was astounded,
shocked, and hurt; but Margaret pacified
and consoled her. She assured
her that it was a great deal better
than if they had had this separation
hanging over them for weeks,
and if she had been obliged to take a
formal leave of every body.</p>

<p>"Now I have bidden them good-by
in the pleasantest way," she said;
"they are all pleased with me, and so
must you be, too, dear, dear Aunt Selina!
We are too good friends to disagree
about this."</p>

<p>"But you will come back after the
wedding, dear? You feel this is your
home, do you not?"</p>

<p>"I will come back, but not immediately.
I mean to pass next winter
in New York; and you will come and
make me a long visit, to make up for
my living on you so long here." And
Margaret drew so bright a picture of
the good times they would have together
in New York that Miss Spelman
bade her good-night quite happily.
Margaret's movements were always
so sudden that the quiet old lady
was not, after all, as surprised as might
have been expected.</p>

<p>"It was just like her," she said;
"such decision of mind, such energy
of character!"</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XVII.<br />

CONQUERED BY CONQUERING.</h3>

<p>Margaret, meanwhile, who had quietly
completed all her arrangements
and packed her trunks, went to her
room, and, after laying aside her rose-colored
dress, and putting on her
wrapper, sat down to her table and
wrote her letter. It did not seem at
all difficult to her to write, though she
once or twice laid down her pen and
thought for a few minutes, with a
grave face.</p>

<p>She wrote no rough copy, and made
no alterations; but went on firmly,
line by line, till she had signed her
name, when she read it carefully over,
sealed and directed it. It took her
about half an hour, and then she went
directly to bed, and slept as soundly
as a child.</p>

<p>Dr. James's state of mind grew
worse and worse, as he approached
his home, and, after leaving Rosanna
at her stable, he walked up and down
before the house many times, before
he went in to write his letter. Never
before had any letter given him such
trouble. He wrote and rewrote it;
left it and walked about his room;
took refuge in a book, and then put
it down in despair. At last he resolved
to try for the last time, and
keep what he should write; and this
was his letter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Miss Lester</span>: I have a humiliating
confession to make to you; but before
I make it (afterward it would be impossible)
I feel obliged to say to you that your
conduct since you have been at Shellbeach
has compelled my respect and admiration.
I appreciate the courage and earnestness
with which you adopted your change of life,
and, instead of seeking in it only your own
amusement, made your stay here not only
a pleasure to your friends, but a blessing
to persons whose number I can only guess
at, but whom your own heart knows.</p>

<p>"I know, Miss Lester, you are wealthy;
I knew it long before you came here. And
your wealth, I acknowledge it to my shame,
has been a temptation to me. I believe you
consider all men mercenary, and fortune-hunters.
I think you are mistaken; and I
wish you to take the humiliation of what I
am going to say as a proof that you are
wrong. Miss Lester, I know I do not love
you, and here is the proof: If I think of
you as my wife, the thought of what your
money would be to me comes <em>first</em> to my
mind. Having said that, I can say no more;
but I am, always yours faithfully,</p>

<p class="signature">
"<span class="smcap">Francis James</span>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Shellbeach</span>, July 18, 1868."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span></p>

<p>The clock struck one as the doctor
signed his name, tore up the unfinished
letters which lay around him,
and hastened to extinguish his light and
go to bed. He was angry with himself,
and disgusted with his letter; and
for the first time for years, found that
he could not sleep. One minute he
repented of what he had done, and
called himself a fool; the next, he
said to himself, "I must tell her
the truth; she deserves it." He then
asked himself what she did deserve?
It was plain to him what her plan of
action was to be: she wished to part
friends, because she supposed that she
would by her letter give a dreadful
blow to his hopes, and consign him
to despair. At this, he laughed with
pleasure, to think that his letter would
undeceive and disappoint her. Then
rose up clearly before him the always
recurring temptation of his great need
of money, and all the good he could
do with it. What a chance had been
offered him! Would he ever have such
another? Might he not, if he had
gone to work differently, won her
heart? Other men had done such
things; and he was better worthy of
her, he was sure of it, than the society-men
she had so often spoken of
with contempt. Had he not heard
that "any man can have any woman"?
No, that was not right; it
was, "Any woman can have any
man." Then, had she tried to ensnare
him? had she really endeavored
to please him? He could not say
she had; but he remembered, with
some discomfiture, her apparent enjoyment
in shocking and teasing him.
She was an enigma; but he believed
her honest, and was glad he had told
her the truth.</p>

<p>To tell all Dr. James's reflections of
that night, would take considerably
longer than it took him to make them,
which was two or three hours; so we
will leave him to his uncomfortable
pillow, and not return to him till he
opened his chamber-door, at seven
o'clock in the morning, and saw Tommy
McNally waiting with a letter in
his hand. The doctor handed the
boy his own, and walked into his
study, where he sat down at his table
and contemplated the square white
envelope and graceful monogram,
and his own name written in a large,
firm hand. He slowly opened the
letter, struck by its neatness and the
fair, distinct writing, and read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="signature">

"<span class="smcap">Sweet Brier Cottage</span>,<br />
July 18, 1868.<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Dr. James</span>: When, six months
ago, I promised to write you this letter, I
certainly had no idea that I should say in it
what I am about to say now. Whether, if
this possibility had occurred to me, I should
have made that promise, or whether I should
have come to Shellbeach at all, it is profitless
to consider.</p>

<p>"I know you always speak the truth frankly,
and I am resolved, in all my dealings
with you, to do the same; for I feel that I
shall thus best show my appreciation and
approbation of your character, and of the
plain truth which I know you will write to
me to-night. You deserve honest treatment,
and you shall have it. I consider the
time I have spent here to be the great lesson
of my life, and one which I on no account
regret, though I weigh well the significance
of the words. I have learned to know and
value the useful and unselfish life and work
of one man, and from him to believe in the
capacity for noble things in other people
whom I once despised. In recognizing your
superiority, I have grown humble; and from
your wisdom and good sense, I have come
to be aware of my own ignorance and conceit.
I know how strongly you will object
to hearing this, but be patient a little longer.
You have given me a lesson you will be
glad to hear of, and it is this: I believe
that a useless life will never again content
me, and that to do some active good will be
the only way to make my life happy.</p>

<p>"But you will say all this is not to the purpose,
and not in the bond. You are very
right; and though I beat round the bush, I
do not mean to beg the question, and I know
very well that honor, esteem, appreciation,
good resolutions, etc., etc., were not to be
the subjects of this letter. Truly then, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
love you, and I have never loved before. I
believe that to be your wife, in this little
town, with no society and no excitements,
to share your work and your poverty, (if
poverty indeed it were,) would be a happy
lot. I tell you this, because I trust you; I
know it is not maidenly, but it is honest. I
shall not see you again; for I know you do
not love me, and that your letter will tell the
truth. I thank you for your kindness, and
your wise and good advice. I hope it has
not all been lost upon me. I hope you will
sometimes let me know what you are interested
in, and how you are prospering.</p>

<p>"Good-by, and believe me your true
friend,</p>

<p class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Margaret Lester</span>.<br />
</p>

<p>"Once more, I do not regret any thing."</p></blockquote>

<p>Poor Dr. James! He read the last
word, and sat like a man in a dream
staring at the letter before him. Suddenly
he started up, seized his hat
from its peg, put it on, and rushed to
the door; then came back, threw his
hat away from him and sat down
again, burying his face in his hands.
Fool, fool that he had been! What
had he thrown away? Was there ever
a woman like this? What would it not
be for him, for any man, to go through
life with such a companion; who
would never hold him back from what
was right; who would not fear to meet
any thing for the sake of truth and justice?
What woman in a hundred would
have done this? knowing, too, that her
love was not returned. And how did
she know it? Oh! how much more
clear-sighted she had been than he,
with all his wisdom and experience! If
he had not shut his eyes, if he could
have had the least suspicion of this,
what a difference might it not have
made? Then he resolved to seek her,
to go through fire and water if need be,
if he could only find her, and bring her
back, and never let her leave him
again.</p>

<p>At that moment, the words he had
written to her came before him, and
threw him again into despair. No; all
was lost! He had insulted her, causelessly
and needlessly; he had said
that he valued her money more than
herself! Her money! Would she had
not a cent; would she were dependent
and friendless, that he might work
for her, share with her all that he had,
and win name and fame for her!</p>

<p>When Mrs. Day, his housekeeper,
put her head into his room, exclaiming
that the breakfast-bell had rung half
an hour ago, he followed her to the
dining-room and swallowed his cold
coffee without a word, with a meekness
that touched the heart of his Gorgon.
She proposed boiling him an
egg, or cutting a few shavings of ham;
but the doctor declined her attentions
(to her great relief) and hurried to the
stable for Rosanna. He drove twenty
miles away to his most distant
patient, whom he alarmed by his
gloomy face and abrupt manner; he
drove Rosanna back to Sealing at a
rate she was unaccustomed to, and
walking up the street&mdash;it was then late
in the afternoon&mdash;encountered Tommy
McNally, roaring at the top of his
voice, and rubbing his eyes as if he
wished to leave in them no powers of
vision. Dr. James stopped and asked
rather crossly what ailed him:</p>

<p>"O doctor! she's gone away, and
she's given me this," holding up
a dollar bill and continuing to cry,
"and one for each of us; and she's
gone away, and we won't see her any
more!"</p>

<p>"Do you mean Miss Lester?"</p>

<p>"Yes, doctor," said Tommy, beginning
to dry his eyes. "I've been
to the station and seen her go off; and
she told me to be a good boy and
help mother."</p>

<p>"Mind you do it," said the doctor,
hurrying away and home to his
cold dinner. That evening he called
on Father Barry, and heard that Margaret
had been there on her way to
the cars, and had left directions for
all her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégés</i>, especially the McNallys.
Father Barry seemed quite dejected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
about her departure, and much
surprised at it; but the doctor, of
course, chose to throw no light on
the subject.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

"THE HEARTBREAK OF TO-MORROW."</h3>

<p>A few days after, as soon as Dr.
James could make up his mind to do
so, he called on Miss Spelman, and
found the house quite as forlorn as
he had expected, and his old friend
very glad to receive sympathy. She
said she had heard from her niece
that very day.</p>

<p>"It was an amusing, affectionate
letter," said Miss Selina, "just like
her. Poor child! she will be easy now
she is with her friend. She was very
much changed, doctor."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Why, she had grown so quiet and
so strange&mdash;that is, she seemed to me
strange; she would sit so long without
speaking a word; and then she
was much more affectionate&mdash;I mean
more demonstrative&mdash;than when she
first came; but she seemed to have
lost her good spirits."</p>

<p>"I thought she seemed much as
usual whenever I saw her."</p>

<p>"Yes, she was gayer than ever
when any one was here; but that was
only put on. Poor child! she felt
Jessie's marriage, and that she was
so soon to be separated from the
friend of her childhood."</p>

<p>Miss Spelman seemed to think the
doctor needed consolation, and from
little remarks and insinuations, he imagined
that she considered him suffering
from disappointment; he did not
try to undeceive her, for was it not
true?</p>

<p>He found Martha Burney a great
comfort; to her he sometimes talked
of Margaret, and from her he learned
to understand things in her character
which had been puzzling to him before.
And the more he became convinced
that Margaret had spoken the
truth in saying that she loved him,
the more he wondered at and admired
her for so completely concealing
it from him in their intercourse; and
the better he understood that her apparent
levity and exaggerated spirits
were no doubt assumed in order to
hide her deeper feelings. He thought
much of all these things, and wondered
more; but he kept his secret
and hers, and only suspected sometimes
that Miss Burney knew more
than any one else about the matter.</p>

<p>Dr. James was a disappointed
man, and he made no effort to disguise
it from himself; but he was not
a man to sit down in despair and
waste his life in regrets. So, recognizing
the fact that he had thrown
away a great chance of happiness,
and been wholly to blame for it, he
resolutely turned the energy of his
thoughts into other channels, and
worked harder than ever. But Sealing
became unutterably wearisome to
him; it was only by iron determination
that he went through with his
daily round of duties, and as for society,
he confined himself exclusively
to making the calls that he imposed
on himself, and going for relaxation
to Father Barry and Miss Burney.</p>

<p>In the middle of August he left
Richards in charge, and went for a
week to his mother and sisters in
Maine.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XIX.<br />

A LAST LOOK.</h3>

<p>Soon after Dr. James's return from
Maine, he was apprised by his friend
Philip of his approaching wedding,
to take place at Newport, on September
first. Philip urged his and
Jessie's wish that he should be a
groomsman; but this Dr. James,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
knowing that Margaret would of
course be a bridesmaid, declared
would be out of the question. He
unwillingly promised to be present at
both wedding and reception, because
he had no reason to give for declining;
and he looked forward to the
day with mingled feelings of dread
and impatience. He bought a dress
suit for the first time for years; and
when he was arrayed in state, gloves
and all, surveyed himself from head
to foot with strong disapprobation.
He had spent the night at a hotel in
Newport, and, having completed his
toilet, descended to the parlor, where
he had an opportunity of beholding
his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout ensemble</i> in the long glass between
the windows.</p>

<p>"I look like the ass in the lion's
skin," he said to himself; "only I
suppose that was too big for him,
while every thing I have on is too
small for me. I sha'n't be myself
again till I get off these vanities."</p>

<p>He arrived at the church full half
an hour before the time, he was so
afraid of being late, and chose his
seat up-stairs, where he could see
better without being conspicuous.
He observed the showy dresses and
latest fashions with wonder and disapproval,
and speculated on the probable
cost of the ladies assembled
to their husbands and fathers, till the
clock pointed to twelve and the bridal
party arrived. First came a troop
of little girls in white, with pink and
blue sashes, carrying baskets of flowers;
then Mrs. Edgar with Philip;
the six bridesmaids followed, headed
by Margaret, each accompanied by
her groomsman, and the doctor noticed
that Miss Lester's companion
was a tall, handsome fellow, with a
fair mustache; last came the bride,
on the arm of an elderly man, whom
Dr. James supposed to be her uncle.</p>

<p>The ceremony was soon over, and
the church rapidly becoming deserted,
when Dr. James descended from
his post of observation, and got into a
carriage to go to Mrs. Edgar's house.
He found the two handsome parlors
quite full, and stood for a few minutes
at the door observing the scene before
him.</p>

<p>The bride and bridegroom stood
at the end of the room, with the
pretty children playing in the bay-window
behind them. Philip looked
as proud and beaming as might have
been expected, and Jessie was just what
the doctor thought she would be: very
pretty and refined, looking timid and
rather flushed at receiving so many
congratulations. His eyes scarcely
rested on her; for he was immediately
conscious of Margaret standing
near her, apparently dividing her attentions
pretty equally between three
gentlemen. Her dress was white,
very rich and flowing; she held a
beautiful bouquet, and there were rose-buds
in her hair and on her dress.
The next thing he knew, one of the
gentlemen-managers was asking his
name, he was led up and presented,
and found himself embraced by Philip,
and greeted with a sweet smile
by Jessie.</p>

<p>"He is the best fellow in the
world," said the bridegroom; and
Jessie added,</p>

<p>"We are very glad to see you, Dr.
James; it was very kind of you to
come."</p>

<p>Then he turned to find Margaret
by his side, with the smile he knew
so well, and the cordial, outstretched
hand. His face flushed painfully, but
he was not called upon to speak, for
Philip remarked,</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, you are old acquaintances,
are you not? Where is Mrs. Edgar?
I want her so much to see him.
Oh! there she is at the end of the other
room. I suppose it wouldn't do for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
me to leave Jessie." And he turned
to his bride with a face full of happiness.</p>

<p>"I will go with Dr. James," said
Margaret at once; and he found himself
walking, with her on his arm,
through the crowd of people, some
of whom regarded him with curiosity.</p>

<p>"You were at the church, were
you not?" began Margaret at once;
"and was she not a lovely bride? I
was very much afraid it would be a
showery wedding; but Jessie behaved
very well, only she arrived at home
a perfect Niobe, and had to be consoled
in private before she could face
all these people."</p>

<p>"Why should she have to be consoled?"</p>

<p>"Now, that's just what I say, Dr.
James; why does she marry him if
it doesn't make her happy? Philip,
however, seems to understand her,
and I leave to him the task of comforting.
She is very fond of her mother,
and it is very hard for her to
live so far away, you know."</p>

<p>"Miss Lester, you look thin and
pale," the doctor said very abruptly;
he did not mean to say it, the words
came almost involuntarily.</p>

<p>"Yes, this has been a wearing time
for all of us; I am glad it is nearly
over. Here we are. Mrs. Edgar,
this is Philip's friend and mine, Dr.
James."</p>

<p>The doctor received the kindest
greeting, and was overpowered
with questions about his mother, who
had been a school friend of Mrs.
Edgar, and his sisters. He tried to answer
them intelligibly, thinking, however,
only of Miss Lester, and conscious
that she had turned away to
be polite to other guests. Mrs. Edgar
then introduced him to Jessie's
sister Isabel, a fresh little girl of sixteen,
who looked full of fun and
mischief, and she in turn presented
him to a friend, a tall young lady,
who immediately began to talk to
him so fast that he could hardly keep
up with her. Mrs. Edgar suggested
that he should get some ice-cream
for himself and them, and then occupied
herself with other people, considering
that her duties of hospitality
to him were performed. Dr. James
went obediently into the next room
and returned, after some difficulties,
with ices and cake, and did his best
to be polite. Soon Isabel was sent
into the other room to see about
the children, and the talkative young
lady became engaged in conversation
with an equally voluble young gentleman,
so that Dr. James found himself
again alone. He put down his
untasted cake, and seeing a glass of
wine near him, which seemed to belong
to no one, he drank it and felt
rather better. The solitariness one
sometimes feels in a crowd came
over him, and he looked from one
strange face to another, feeling himself
completely out of place. Mrs.
Edgar was absorbed in duties of
hospitality; Jessie and Philip in the
distance, during a pause in the stream
of guests, were engrossed in each
other; even Margaret seemed to have
completely forgotten him, and he saw
her earnestly talking with her handsome
groomsman. He regretted that
he had refused to be a groomsman;
no doubt he would have been assigned
to Margaret, as the corresponding
"best friend," and then she
would have been talking to him instead
of to that fellow; from which
it will be seen that he had already
arrived at a stage of lover-like inconsistency,
since his sole motive for
declining his friend's invitation had
been his dread of encountering Miss
Lester.</p>

<p>He saw that many people were going,
and it came to him as a happy
thought that he might go too. He
interrupted Mrs. Edgar to shake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
hands again with her, observed that
Margaret was near the door, and next
made his way to Philip, with whom
he had a little talk, unsatisfactory, of
course, but one's best friend must
be excused for being preoccupied on
such an occasion. Philip parted from
him with resignation, saying that he
must come to California and settle,
that he would do splendidly there
and make a fortune. Such a prospect
seemed to the doctor dreary in the
extreme; and owning to himself that
he did not at all begrudge to Philip
his pretty and delicate bride, he bade
her a friendly farewell, and approached
Margaret. He was glad to interrupt
the groomsman in the <i>sotto voce</i> remarks
he was making, and to have
Margaret turn at once to him and
leave her companion to his own reflections.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Miss Lester. I go back
to Sealing this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Good-by, Dr. James. I am very
glad you came." That was all; how
soon these words were said! Again
he met the straightforward look of
those clear, brown eyes; again he felt
the kind pressure of her hand. Her
glove was off and so was his, (not
accident on his part,) and he felt that
her hand was cold. He was on the
point of saying, "How pale you are!"
but remembered just in time, that he
had made that remark before.</p>

<p>In another minute he was outside
the door, and driving to the hotel.
As he drew his tight boots from his
aching feet, and resumed his comfortable,
familiar clothes, he said to himself,</p>

<p>"This episode in my life is closed.
I must shut her completely out of
my existence, and go on as if there
were no such woman as Margaret
Lester."</p>

<p>So he took the five o'clock train,
and arrived safely in Sealing that
night.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XX.<br />

MISS BURNEY LEAVES SHELLBEACH.</h3>

<p>One evening, two or three weeks
after the wedding at Newport, Dr.
James was sitting with Miss Burney
in her little parlor. They often used
that privilege of fast friends, silence;
and it was after an unbroken pause
of full a quarter of an hour that
Martha looked up from her sewing,
and said:</p>

<p>"Why did you never notice that I
have not resumed my school-work
this year?"</p>

<p>"I have noticed it; but supposed
you had some good reason, which
you would tell me when you were
ready."</p>

<p>"I am ready now. I have given
up teaching for the present, and perhaps
for ever." The doctor made no
reply, only showing by his attentive
face that he was listening.</p>

<p>"Margaret has offered me a home,
and I have accepted it."</p>

<p>"I imagined you were too proud
to accept assistance from any body."</p>

<p>"From any body else except her.
In the first place, she is rich and can
afford it; secondly, it makes her happy
to help people; thirdly, I love
her and she loves me, and that is the
best reason of all."</p>

<p>"You are right; and what decided
you to take this step?"</p>

<p>"It seems she has had it in her
mind ever since last spring; however,
she only said to me, just before she
left here, that she hoped I would
make no arrangements for the winter,
without first telling her my plans.
Two weeks ago, I received a letter
from her, saying that she had decided
not to live any longer with Mrs. Edgar;
but, after passing the month of
September at Newport, to take a
house for herself in New York. She
said she could not live alone, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
she must have some one for company
and for the sake of appearances.
She begged me to be that
somebody, because there was no one
else with whom she could feel independent,
and free to do what she
chose. I considered the subject a
week, and then wrote her my consent
to do as she wished, for next winter
at least. It will be a great advantage
to me, of course, as well as a pleasure.
Still I should not think of it on that account
for a moment, if I did not believe
that such an arrangement would
be a good thing for her as well as for
me. I do believe so, and therefore I
am going to try the experiment."</p>

<p>"You will not repent it, I am sure.
And when do you go?"</p>

<p>"Next week."</p>

<p>"Has she bought her house?"</p>

<p>"She has not decided yet, and
wants my help about furnishing, etc.;
so the sooner I go the better."</p>

<p>"Is she in New York now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, at a private boarding-house,
where I am to stay with her till the
house is ready."</p>

<p>Dr. James had made up his mind
that nothing would astonish him
again, yet this did take him by surprise;
after he thought about it, however,
he only wondered such an arrangement
had not occurred to him
before. Miss Burney was a great loss
to him; for there was no other woman
whose society was any pleasure to him,
and Father Barry was now the only
person with whom he had any sympathy,
and of him he saw more and
more.</p>

<p>He begged Martha Burney to
write to him, but she was a miserable
correspondent; her letters were few
and far between, and never told him
what he wanted to know. He was
obliged to go to Miss Spelman for all
his information regarding these two
people in whom he was so deeply interested.
He heard from her that
Margaret had bought a very pretty
little house, furnished it, and was comfortably
established with Martha. She
said Margaret always wrote in excellent
spirits, and seemed to her to be
enjoying her winter very much.</p>

<p>The doctor's "young man" Richards,
thanks to the careful instructions
and preparation he had received, was
now become of great assistance, and,
being left in charge, had very successfully
treated several cases, and even
performed very well one or two surgical
operations, so that people began
to feel considerable confidence in
him. Dr. James encouraged this as
much as possible; for the idea of giving
up his practice at Shellbeach and
vicinity had taken strong hold on
him. Finding that he left his patients
in competent hands, he often went
away on business for a week at a time,
and felt his own work considerably
lightened.</p>

<p>At Christmas time, Miss Spelman
went to New York, and staid a
month, and returned eloquent about
the delights of her niece's establishment,
and the charming people she
had met. The doctor, by careful questions,
learned from her that Margaret
was occupied with countless
good works and charities, though Miss
Selina seemed to have only a vague
idea what they were. She described
to her attentive auditor how she
breakfasted in her own room, every
day, at ten o'clock, or as much later
as she liked, (which had always been
her idea of comfort,) and then had
the carriage to do what she chose till
luncheon at two, when she saw Margaret
for the first time; for she was always
full of her charitable engagements
till one, when she came home
to dress. After luncheon, in time for
which some pleasant person always
dropped in, they drove, visited, or
shopped, and dined at six. Then
Miss Spelman told of the opera, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
concerts, and a dinner-party that Margaret
gave while she was there, and
of the old friends she had met, and of
the many calls and great attention
she had received; and she went on,
telling about herself, with only now
and then a word about Margaret, till
the doctor was quite tired of listening.
He was very curious about
Margaret's morning work; of that
his old friend, having seen nothing,
could give no information; and after
the account of the gayeties of Miss
Lester's household, Doctor James
grew more restless than ever.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XXI.<br />

SEEK YE FIRST THE KINGDOM OF GOD.</h3>

<p>January wore away, and February,
and at last, on one of the first days
of the first month of spring, a raw
and dreary day, when Dr. James had
been glad that no patient needed his
attendance, he had made a bright little
fire, and was sitting in his study
chair, deeply engaged with the last
number of <span class="smcap">The Catholic World</span>,
which Father Barry had lent him.
Richards came in from the post-office,
laid the doctor's mail upon the table,
and then went home to his mother's
house. Dr. James very deliberately
finished the article he was reading,
stared at the fire for a few minutes,
and then carelessly took up his letters
and glanced at the handwritings.
There was one from his sister Lucy,
one from a medical friend at the West,
and&mdash;what was this?&mdash;one in a clear,
firm hand, which gave him a start,
and brought him very quickly out of
his reverie.</p>

<p>"From Margaret Lester! What
can she have to say to me?"</p>

<p>A misgiving came over him as he
held the letter in his hand, and he
delayed opening it. What might not
her boldness and independence be
capable of! He smiled contemptuously
as he realized that his imagination
was running away with him.</p>

<p>"She is engaged, I suppose," and
he quickly broke the seal.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Friend</span>: I write to you
because this is the very happiest day of my
life, and because I owe that happiness, after
God, to you.</p>

<p>"Do you remember your words, 'For
the direction of practical, systematic good
works, I advise you to go to the Catholic
priest'? Well, I established myself in New
York with the object of making myself happy
by doing as much good to the poor as I
was able; and as soon as I asked myself how
I should begin, I thought of your words,
and said to myself, 'I found how true that
advice was in that quiet little town; now, why
should it not hold good in a great city like
this, where there is so much more misery,
and where opportunities for doing good are
so much greater?' So I said to my cook,
whom I found to be a good Catholic, going
to her confessions and communions regularly,
'Where does your priest live? For I want
to go and see him.' She gladly told me
where to find him, and I went where she directed
me, and found an old, white-headed
Frenchman with most courtly manners, before
whom I felt as unpolished as a school-girl.
I told him the simple truth, and asked
to be instructed as to how I could aid the
poor. Well, we sat down, and he gave me
a little sketch of the different Catholic charities
in New York, and each one, as he described
it, seemed to me best of all; and I
saw how much more good I could do by
aiding those perfectly organized charities
than by working on my own responsibility.
He ended by telling me of a lady who
would take me with her and show me all
these institutions.</p>

<p>"From that day began for me a life of
revelations. I had always dreamed of lives
of heroism; and I began to see that they
were not only possible, but of every-day occurrence
among those men and women devoted
to works of mercy. Then came the
question, What is it that inspires such self-sacrifice,
such complete abnegation and ignoring
of self, such all-embracing charity
and purity of motive? For in no case
could I see a trace of any personal advantage
to be gained from these almost superhuman
labors. And then, Dr. James, I began
to look into the doctrine of that church
which all my life I had been taught to regard
as the teacher of falsehood, superstition,
and idolatry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span></p>

<p>"The result has been that a week ago I
was baptized a Roman Catholic, and this
day, for the first time, I have received our
Lord Jesus Christ in the most holy communion.</p>

<p>"O my friend! God's goodness has been
great to me, and I am as happy as a person
should be who has found there is such a
thing as heaven upon earth. This is why I
have written to you, because my heart, in
its gratitude to God, turns next to you; and
also because I wish you to hear from no one
except myself of this great change in my life.</p>

<p>"And now, I cannot end my letter without
one more word. I have another saying
of yours in my mind; was it not this?
'Do as well as you know how, and then be at
peace.' That is true; yet it is not all that
will be required of us. We ought to try to
know the best thing, and then do what we
know as well as we can.</p>

<p>
"Good-by, and God bless you.</p>

</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;Martha Burney, after trying her
best to dissuade me, had the justice to examine
what I was about, and she was received
into the church this very day."</p></blockquote>

<p>Father Barry received this news
by the same mail as Dr. James, and
from him Margaret heard at once.
The pious priest wrote a letter full of
joy and congratulation, of good advice
and blessing; but to her other
letter no answer was received. Two
weeks passed, and no word came.
Miss Selina had written a reproachful
and admonitory letter, assuring
Margaret that it was not too late,
and while life was spared her she
could draw back. She insinuated
that a plan of rescue could be easily
arranged, and offered her home as an
asylum to the fugitive.</p>

<p>Margaret laughed over this letter,
and showed it to her friends with
great glee. However, she wrote
back a kind and soothing answer,
which softened her aunt a little,
though the subject continued a very
sore one for a long time. To think
that she should have been a month
in the same house with Margaret,
never suspecting the machinations
of which the poor child was being
made the victim! But when she applied
to Dr. James for sympathy, he
said abruptly,</p>

<p>"I don't agree with you at all,
ma'am. Miss Lester has done right
because she has consulted her own
conscience, and been brave enough
not to stop for what the world or her
friends would say or think."</p>

<p>He then changed the subject; and
Miss Spelman was so much scandalized
that she never spoke of it again.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XXII.<br />

ALL THINGS SHALL BE ADDED UNTO YOU.</h3>

<p>On the 18th of March, Margaret
had returned to luncheon from visiting
some sick persons; Martha had
staid at home to cut out work to be
given to poor women. She entered
Margaret's room as she was dressing,
holding one hand behind her.</p>

<p>"I have had a note from Dr.
James to-day," said Martha. "He is
in the city, and we shall see him to-morrow."</p>

<p>Margaret looked up inquiringly.</p>

<p>"You have something else to tell!
I see it in your face. Why do you
make me wait?"</p>

<p>"I have something else to tell, and
this shall tell it for me," she answered,
laying a letter down on Margaret's
table, and going out of the
room. Margaret, with trembling fingers,
tore it open and read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="signature">
"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, March 18.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Miss Lester</span>: It has not
been from disapprobation, nor neglect, nor
indifference that I have left your letter so
long unanswered. It is because I earnestly
desired, if possible, to give you some good
news in return for that which you sent me.</p>

<p>"You speak of owing your conversion
partly to me, and I am very happy that this
should be true; but your letter has done a
greater work for me than you thought it
could when you wrote it. Miss Lester, I
ought to have been where you are now a
year ago; but pride of intellect, perversity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
of will, and, latterly, another obstacle, have
stood in my way, and I might have kept on
blind and miserable for the rest of my life.
You have found the church of God through
its treasures of charity, displayed in its
works of mercy to the poor, the weak, and
the sinful; it was your heart, so to speak,
that carried you there. I have found the
same church entirely by my mind. I have
seen repeatedly shallow prejudices, groundless
suspicions, and fanatical attacks met
by calm, strong, logical arguments. I have
seen the carping opinions of sects dwindling
away before the majesty of a revealed faith.
I have recognized that intellect, learning,
science, philosophy, shine brightest in that
church which the scoffers of the day assert
to be in her dotage and dissolution. I have
been forced at last, to admit her divine authority,
and the consequent infallibility of
her teaching, and there was but one thing
left for me to do. How long would I have
resisted light, conviction? I cannot tell.
Cowardice, pride, and something else held
me back; then your letter came, as a push
from a friendly hand to a wretch clinging to
the feeble branch which threatens to give
way in his grasp and precipitate him into
the abyss below, yet fearing to take the leap
which will land him on firm ground.</p>

<p>"We have landed on the rock&mdash;you and
I. God grant that we may stand on it for
ever.</p>

<p>"I have much more to say, but can write
no more. I have been for a week making a
retreat at the house of the &mdash;&mdash; fathers, and
I shall be baptized in their church to-morrow
morning, Feast of St. Joseph, after the nine
o'clock mass. You will come, will you not?
Pray for me.</p>

<p class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Francis James.</span>"
</p></blockquote>

<p>Margaret read this letter steadily
through to the end, and then fell on
her knees by her little table, where
Martha found her some time after,
when she came to summon her to
luncheon.</p>

<p>"He has asked me to be his godmother,"
remarked Martha, as they
were sitting at the dining-table.</p>

<p>"Has he? I should think he
would have asked me," responded
Margaret.</p>

<p>"Don't you remember what you
told me once about the spiritual relationship
between sponsors and their
god-children, and what it precludes?"</p>

<p>Margaret slightly smiled, and the
subject was dropped.</p>

<p>On arriving next morning at St.
&mdash;&mdash; church, Margaret found that
the first pew was reserved for Martha
and herself, and soon Dr. James appeared
and knelt with them. To the
surprise and delight of Margaret, who
should enter the sanctuary to celebrate
mass but Father Barry; and it
was he who, at the conclusion of the
holy sacrifice, administered the sacrament
of baptism.</p>

<p>Margaret's cup of happiness was
very full when, going into the house
afterward, by invitation, she was able
to exchange congratulations with her
good friend Father Barry, and grasp,
with a glowing face and speaking
eyes, the hand of the newly-baptized.
They both agreed to dine with her;
and then she went home with Martha,
wondering over the changes which
one year had brought about in her
life, and thanking God in her heart
for her conversion and for that of the
person dearest to her in the world.</p>

<p>The dinner that evening was a very
delightful one. Margaret and the doctor
were surprised to find all embarrassment
between them gone. All
their past intercourse seemed far
away and like what had happened in
a dream, and they felt that they were
beginning their friendship over again
on a new and true basis.</p>

<p>Margaret had many questions to
ask of Father Barry about Sealing,
and the different families she was interested
in, and he had a great deal
to tell her, as well as questions to ask
in his turn. And Margaret told all
about the beautiful religious houses
she had visited, and about kind Abbé
Saincère, who had done her so much
good, lent her books and led her gently
on till she was safely in the fold.</p>

<p>Martha Burney had to tell of her
horror when she found what Margaret
was wrapped up in; how she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
scolded, and argued, and ridiculed,
and at last went in secret to see the
abbé, to remonstrate with him. How
she was won by his gentleness and
courtesy, and how, still in secret and
with his assistance, she read and
learned about the church, till on Margaret's
asking one day why she made
no more fuss about her becoming a
Catholic, she said the reason was because
she was going to be one herself
as soon as she could be prepared.</p>

<p>Then Dr. James told about his
plans: how Richards was all ready to
step into his place, and in a great
hurry to have the establishment, dispensary,
etc., under his own control;
how he was a good-hearted young
fellow, and the doctor thought would
be merciful to the poor; and his mother
would come and live with him,
and take the place of the tyrannical
housekeeper. Then, for himself, Dr.
James announced his intention of removing
to New York as soon as his
affairs at Shellbeach were settled.</p>

<p>Margaret was quieter than usual,
and more simply dressed than the
doctor had ever seen her before, in a
plain black silk absolutely without
ornament, except that she wore round
her neck an amber rosary, which she
said she had obtained abroad when
she was a heathen. There was in
her face an expression of serenity and
quiet happiness that was new to it,
and Dr. James thought he had never
seen her so attractive and lovable.</p>

<p>The evening flew away; Father
Barry was to return to Sealing the
next day, and the doctor with him
for a week or two, but he would soon
come back to New York to live. At
parting he said in a low voice to
Margaret,</p>

<p>"I am to receive communion in
Father Barry's church a week from
Sunday; you will pray for me?"</p>

<p>"I will not forget," she answered
with a happy smile.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />

MARGARET'S BIRTHDAY.</h3>

<p>The story draws to a close, and
there is little more to tell; the rest is
such plain sailing that it might almost
be taken for granted. There is one
little scene, however, pleasant to write
and possibly pleasant to read, which
took place on August 15th of that
same year, in the church at Sealing;
and in explanation of which a short
account should be given of what happened
after Dr. James had come to
live in New York.</p>

<p>He had taken rooms in that city
and begun to work among the poor,
doing much although with small
means. He began to go regularly
every day to Miss Lester's house in
the afternoon; then they walked and
drove together, and learned to know
each other well. He was often with
her in the morning, too, and together
they visited many a sick and suffering
soul, leaving behind them comfort,
encouragement, and substantial relief.
They every week knelt together at
the altar of the little French chapel
Margaret loved so well, and received
God's greatest gift of love to man,
and it was a time of pure, unclouded
happiness.</p>

<p>It was June; and there had been
a week of very warm weather. The
fashionables had fled from the city, or
shut themselves up in their houses,
excluding every ray of light and sun.
Dr. James, weary from his morning's
labors, had been home, refreshed
himself a little, and then, at about
five o'clock in the afternoon, stood on
the steps of Margaret's house, and
was ushered into the shady parlor.
The green blinds were closed, the
carpets were gone, cool white matting
was on the floors, and great bunches
of roses stood about on tables and
mantel-pieces. Margaret came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
meet him, fresh and cool in her light
dress, and holding in her hand a very
beautiful line engraving of the Dresden
"Madonna and Child."</p>

<p>"See, Dr. James, what Martha has
given me for a birthday present."</p>

<p>"Why did you not tell me beforehand
that this was your birthday,
that I might have given you a present?"</p>

<p>"Truly, because I forgot it till I
found this on the breakfast-table this
morning. It seems I told Martha at
Shellbeach that this was my birthday,
and she remembered it. Was she not
kind?"</p>

<p>"I want to speak to you about
leaving the city," said the doctor;
"the hot weather has come, and it
will not be healthy for you to be here.
The cholera may be about, they say,
and you go into places where you
will be sure to catch it."</p>

<p>"So do you."</p>

<p>"But a doctor is pretty safe; he
can guard against infection in a great
measure."</p>

<p>"Well, a great many other people
stay in New York and do not get
sick. The religious and priests stay
in their houses, and they go among
more wretched people than I do."</p>

<p>"Yes; but Miss Lester, you are
not a religious; your life has not been
wholly consecrated to God, as theirs
have."</p>

<p>"I can't see why, because I have
not a vocation for a religious life,
that should make any difference."</p>

<p>"Plainly, then, because your life is
precious, if not to yourself, to other
people; to me. It should not be
lightly thrown away."</p>

<p>"I shall not throw it away; I don't
believe in contagion. God will preserve
my life, if he wishes it to be
spared."</p>

<p>"Yes; but God is not called upon
to work a miracle in your behalf; and
if you wilfully expose yourself to danger,
he may not interpose to avert the
consequences."</p>

<p>Margaret was silent, and the doctor
continued, with an effort,</p>

<p>"I said your life was precious to
me; and though you did not notice
it, I say it again. I have never had
courage till to-day to speak to you
about the letter I wrote you at Shellbeach;
but it is possible for me to do
so now. You did not seem angry
with me when I saw you at the wedding.
Had you forgotten it, or didn't
you care for my rudeness?"</p>

<p>"I cared for it; that is, of course,
I was sorry, perhaps hurt; still, not
for a moment angry or offended. I
knew that you were not cruel but
kind, for you told the truth; and
any thing except the truth would
have been unkindness. I honored
you for writing it."</p>

<p>"Yet it was not the truth; although
in writing it I sincerely and honestly
believed it to be the truth. I said I
did not love you; I believed I did
not love you; but I had no sooner
read your letter than scales seemed
to fall from my eyes. You see, I was
sure that you were perfectly indifferent
to me; and I thought you would
write me a polite letter, expressing
friendship, esteem, etc., and regret if
I had suffered disappointment; and
then that you would go off to New
York and leave me to support the
downfall of my hopes as best I might.
I was sure of this, and your parting
words that night seemed to confirm
me in it. 'She wishes to part
friends,' I thought to myself, 'because
she believes she is going to ruin my
hopes of happiness.' I was filled with
unpleasant and bitter feelings. I read
your letter, and the ground seemed
to go from under my feet, and
I realized what a blind fool I had
been. I felt then but one longing,
which I feel still, although I know its
uselessness and absurdity: that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
might be, by some chance, stripped
of your fortune to the last cent, that
I might lay my poor little pittance at
your feet and implore your acceptance
of it.</p>

<p>"Oh! if I could tell you what I endured.
Shellbeach became unbearable
to me; all life and interest seemed
to have left me. How I missed you!
You can never imagine it, and I cannot
describe it. The more I thought
of you, the more wretched I became,
and after that wedding I felt tenfold
worse. I went home to my mother
for a change; and then resolved to
put you completely out of my head,
and, as an assistance, resumed my
study of Catholicity, that I had for
a time neglected. Then, though I
blush to own it, and would not risk
my standing in your estimation by
telling you of it except that it proves
my love for you, the only thing which
deterred me from entering the church
was the thought that I should lose
your esteem, and that it would completely
cut me off from any chance
I might ever have again of winning
you for my wife. Your second letter
came, and seemed as an answer from
heaven, 'Why are ye fearful, O ye
of little faith?' You know the rest&mdash;but
I cannot go on. Even supported
by the blessed sympathy we have
in our faith, I cannot ask for what
my heart craves."</p>

<p>"Dr. James, you seem to feel as if
you were before me as a criminal before
his judge. Now you have done
only what was right and true toward
me, and you owe me no apology
for any thing. You and I, I believe,
have done each other real good, and
we have mutually helped each other
into the church; we stand on equal
ground, and I will accept no other
position."</p>

<p>Dr. James looked searchingly at
her, and said in a low voice,</p>

<p>"You do me good and make me
feel like myself. Then, Margaret,
though I am not worthy of you, will
you be my wife?"</p>

<p>Margaret laid her hand in his,</p>

<p>"I will, if God allows me so much
happiness."</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />

THE SEVENTH SACRAMENT.</h3>

<p>Margaret was unwilling to leave
New York; but the doctor insisted,
and a compromise was effected. She
was to stay through July, and complete
the preparations for her marriage;
for that was to take place in
August, and they would go for their
wedding journey to visit Mrs. James
in Maine. Margaret expressed a
strong wish to be married at Sealing,
and the plan was very pleasant to
Dr. James; so a week before the
day appointed, she went to her aunt,
Miss Spelman's. There she spent a
happy week, visiting her friends
among the poor, and hearing from
them about the goodness and kind
deeds of their favorite doctor, whom
they seemed to regard in the light
of a good angel. Martha Burney
was also at Miss Spelman's, and the
doctor came two days before the fifteenth,
so it was a very merry and
happy household.</p>

<p>The feast of the Assumption of
Our Lady was as beautiful a day as
ever shone on a happy bride; the
bells rang as if for a public celebration;
for Dr. James was beloved by
every one and Margaret was very
popular. The time was nine o'clock;
for the bride and bridegroom were
fasting. Margaret's dress was white,
with veil, orange-blossoms, and every
thing as it should be; she had inclined
very much to be married in her
travelling dress; but the doctor wanted
white, and she thought besides,
that a gay, showy wedding would
give pleasure to many of the guests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span></p>

<p>Father Barry said that it was like
the marriage feast in the Gospel; for
the deaf, the halt, and the blind
were well represented. Margaret's
"friends" were many, and the more
aristocratic inhabitants of Sealing and
Shellbeach were rather surprised to
find themselves in close neighborhood
with the McNallys, O'Neills, and
O'Flahertys, who were put in the
best places, and were perfectly at
home in their own church.</p>

<p>The high altar, and those of the
Blessed Virgin and St. Joseph, were
covered with flowers; and a fine new
set of vestments and sacred vessels,
presented by the bride and bridegroom
elect, were used for the first
time.</p>

<p>It seemed to Margaret and to
Dr. James a beautiful circumstance,
though a natural one, that they had
neither of them ever seen a nuptial
mass before this, their own. Nor
had they realized what marriage
might be, until they studied the wonderful
office of that church that has
elevated the natural union of man
and woman to the dignity of a sacrament,
which St. Paul declares to
be typical of the union of our Lord
with his spouse, the church. They
were profoundly impressed with the
thought that the holy of holies was
to be offered upon the altar on that
day, the happiest of their lives&mdash;for
them, for their happiness and blessing;
and that, as God was to descend
from heaven, as it were, in
their honor, so they should offer their
new life for his greater honor and
glory.</p>

<p>How is it possible that Catholics
should ever forego this privilege of
the nuptial mass, and avail themselves
only of the form absolutely
required by the church? Do they
not realize that in sanctifying the
first day of their wedded life by assisting
together at the sacrifice of the
mass, and as their first united action,
receiving their Lord unto their hearts,
they draw down a blessing on all that
is to follow?</p>

<p>Never had Margaret felt so pure
a joy as when, kneeling beside the
one she loved best in the world, she
heard the solemn benediction pronounced
upon them, and the God of
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob besought
to "himself fulfil his blessing" upon
them. Never had Dr. James realized
so fully his happiness as when he
heard the beautiful prayer offered for
his bride, and the virtues of Rachel,
Rebecca, and Sarah invoked for her.</p>

<p>And when, in the little instruction
which Father Barry gave them, he
said they might indeed hope that
Jesus and Mary had been present at
their wedding, as at that of Cana in
Galilee, they felt as if they had received
a favor similar to the one
then bestowed; for, as the water
was turned into wine, was not their
natural rejoicing changed into a joy
more pure and sublime than earth can
bestow?</p>

<p>The married couple, and every Catholic
in the church, remained on
their knees for some time after mass
was ended, and, as one of the spectators
afterward said, "The happy pair
behaved as if they were by no means
the most important persons present."
Martha Burney heard the remark,
and immediately replied,</p>

<p>"You must remember that they
recognized the presence of the Lord
Jesus, surrounded by legions of holy
angels;" to which remark the first
speaker was too much astonished to
make any answer.</p>

<p>On his return to Miss Spelman's
house, Dr. James was greatly surprised
to find standing at the gate an
elegant little doctor's chaise, with a
very beautiful horse; a plainly dressed
man stood by its head, whom the
doctor recognized as a mechanic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
whose life he had saved when he
was lying at death's door with smallpox.
As he spoke to him pleasantly,
the man took off his hat and said,</p>

<p>"If you please, doctor, this is a
present from all your patients."</p>

<p>It was the kind thought of a kind
heart, and the author of it, himself
indebted to the doctor's devoted care,
had gone in person to every house
within twenty miles, inquiring who
had been treated by Dr. James, and
proposing to each a small contribution.</p>

<p>"They only wanted to give too
much," he said to the doctor afterward;
"but all, even the very poorest,
gave something."</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XXV.<br />

THE MISTRESS OF A POOR MAN'S
HOUSEHOLD.</h3>

<p>After a fortnight spent very happily
in Maine, Dr. and Mrs. James came
back to New York, bringing with them
the doctor's youngest sister, Lucy, to
make a long visit. Martha Burney
had been left in charge of the house,
and had received a warm invitation
to consider it her home; but she only
replied that she would think about it.</p>

<p>On arriving at home, (for it was
decided to begin their married life in
the house that Margaret had already
bought and furnished,) and asking eagerly
for her friend, Margaret was informed
that Miss Burney had gone
away that day, and left a note to explain.
It was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dearest Margaret</span>: Do not think,
by my leaving your house, that I do not appreciate
the hospitality that you and your husband
have offered me, or that I am ungrateful
for it. But I could never consent to live
upon you always; and I thought it better,
while I am strong and healthy, to enter on
the life in which I should be glad to be found
at death. I have consulted with M. Saincère,
and he encourages me to hope that my
vocation may be a religious one; and the
sympathy and affection I feel for the Sisters
of Charity, which I believe you share with
me, leads me to seek my home and work
among them, at the house we visited together
on the Hudson River. There I shall remain
for the present as a boarder, till I am quite
sure what is God's will for me; but I may
tell you, in confidence, that I have in mind
the work of teaching the poor and abandoned
little ones of this great city.</p>

<p>"I cannot express the joy which comes to
my heart when I think that my life, which
since my father's death has seemed to me
aimless and unprofitable, may be devoted in
the humblest way to the service of God and
his holy church. Rejoice with me, my
dear friend, in the midst of your own great
happiness. God grant that we may both be
worthy of the favors he has bestowed on us!
I pray him to grant his blessing to you and
yours.</p>

<p>"With love and congratulations to you and
your husband; I remain, in the heart of Jesus,
your faithful friend,</p>

<p class="signature">
"<span class="smcap">Martha Burney</span>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, Sept. 1."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>That evening, when Lucy, tired with
her long journey, had gone up-stairs,
Margaret and Dr. James sat together
in the parlor talking. The windows
were open, and there was a refreshing
breeze; the moonlight lay brightly on
the floor, but except that, the room
was dark.</p>

<p>"I tremble sometimes," said Dr.
James, "when I think of the broad
path of sunshine in which I am walking,
and see that every wish is fulfilled.
I have left Shellbeach with none but
friends behind me; I have health and
strength; money enough for necessaries,
superfluities, and charities; the
noblest and handsomest wife in the
world; the best and only religion to
love and serve with her; the angels
and saints for friends and comrades;
a living God to worship, and the hope
of heaven hereafter. But O Margaret!
the words of St. Paul are very
often with me now, 'But God forbid
that I should glory, save in the cross
of our Lord Jesus Christ.' We have
not much to make us remember the

be ready for it when it comes to us."</p>

<p>"We will not forget it. I will write
those words this night in the prayer-book
Father Barry gave me for my

<p>And when they said their prayers,
Margaret opened the blank page at
the beginning of the book, and, showing
it to her husband, pointed to this
inscription, written by Father Barry,
"The Lord is merciful to those whom
he foreknoweth shall be his by faith
and good works;" and below she had
herself added these words,</p>

<p>"But God forbid that I should glory,
save in the cross of our Lord Jesus
Christ."</p>

<h2>THE EARLY HISTORY OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH ON
THE ISLAND OF NEW-YORK.</h2>

<p class="center">THE REPUBLIC.</p>


<p>The history of Catholicity in colonial
days, with its romance, its terrors,
and the last impotent struggles of
fanatical opposition have, we trust,
not been without interest. The peace
opened New-York to Catholic immigration,
and the influence of the
French officers, of both army and
navy, had done much to dispel prejudice.
The church to which Rochambeau,
La Fayette, De Kalb, Pulaski,
De Grasse, Vandreuil belonged was
socially and politically respectable&mdash;nay,
it was not antagonistic to American
freedom.</p>

<p>The founder of the Catholic congregation
had looked anxiously forward
to this moment.</p>

<p>The venerable Father Farmer came
on to resume his labors, and gather
such Catholics as the seven years' war
had left or gathered. His visits and
pastoral care, then resumed, were
continued till the arrival of the Rev.
Charles Whelan, an Irish Franciscan,
who had been chaplain on one of the
vessels belonging to the fleet of the
Count de Grasse. He was the first
regularly settled priest in the city of
New York. Catholicity thus had a
priest, but as yet no church. Mass
was said near Mr. Stoughton's house,
on Water street; in the house of Don
Diego de Gardoqui, the Spanish ambassador;
in a building in Vauxhall
Garden, between Chambers and Warren
streets; and in a loft over a carpenter
shop on Barclay street. An
Italian nobleman, Count Castiglioni,
mentions his attending mass in a
room any thing but becoming so solemn
an act of religious worship. The
use of a court-room in the Exchange
was solicited from the city authorities,
but refused. Then the little band of
Catholics took heart and resolved to
rear an edifice that would lift its
cross-crowned spire in the land. It
is a sign of the good feeling that
had to some extent obtained, that
Trinity church sold the Catholic body
the five lots of ground they desired for
the erection of their church. Here,
at the corner of Barclay and Church
streets, the corner-stone of St. Peter's
church was laid November 4th, 1786,
by Don Diego de Gardoqui, as representative
of Charles III., King of
Spain, whose aid to the work entitles
him to be regarded as its chief benefactor.</p>

<p>This pioneer Catholic church was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
a modest structure forty-eight feet in
front by eighty-one in depth. Its progress
was slow; and divine worship was
performed in it for some years before
the vestry, portico, pews, gallery, and
steeple were at last completed in 1792.</p>

<p>The congregation, living so long
amid a Protestant population whose
system Halleck describes so truly,</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"They reverence their priest; but disagreeing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In price or creed, dismiss him without fear,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>had adopted some of their ideas, and
forgetting that the mass was a sacrifice,
and the peculiar and only worship of
God, thought that an eloquent sermon
was every thing. A vehement
and impassioned preacher it was their
great ambition to secure, and as the
trustees controlled matters almost absolutely,
the earlier priests had to endure
much humiliation and actual suffering.</p>

<p>The reader will find this period
of struggle well described in Bishop
Bayley's pages, with the culmination
of the evils of trusteeism in the bankruptcy
of St. Peter's.</p>

<p>A pastor was at last found who
filled the difficult position. This was
the Rev. William O'Brien, assisted
after a time by Doctor Matthew
O'Brien, whose reputation as a preacher
was such that a volume of his
sermons had been printed in Ireland.
Under their care the difficulties began
to diminish; the congregation took
a regular form, and the young were
trained to their Christian duties; and
the devotion of the Catholic clergy
during the visits of that dreadful
scourge, the yellow fever, gave them
an additional claim to the reverence
and respect of their flock.</p>

<p>Beside the church soon sprang up
the school. The Catholics of New
York signalized the opening of the
nineteenth century by establishing a
free school at St. Peter's, which before
many years could report an average
attendance of five hundred pupils.</p>

<p>This progress of Catholicity naturally
aroused some of the old bitterness
of prejudice.</p>

<p>The sermons of the Protestant
pulpits at this period exulting over
the captivity and death of Pius VI.
produced their natural result in
awakening the evil passions of the
low and ignorant. The old prejudices
revived against Catholics with
all their wonted hostility. The first
anti-Catholic riot occurred in 1806,
as a result. On Christmas eve, some
ruffians attempted to force their way
into St. Peter's church during the
midnight mass, in order to see the
Infant rocked in the cradle which
they were taught to believe Catholics
then worshipped. The <i>Brief Sketch</i>
details the unfortunate event from the
papers of the day.</p>

<p>From that time anti-Catholic excitements
have been pretty regular in their
appearance; for a time, indeed, eleven
years was as sure to bring one, under
some new name, as fourteen years
did the pestilent locusts. Yet mob
violence has been less frequently and
less terribly shown in New York than
in some other cities with higher claims
to order and dignity.</p>

<p>Once we remember how a mob,
flushed with the sacking of a Protestant
church where a negro and a
white had been married, resolved to
close their useful labors by demolishing
St. Patrick's cathedral. They
marched valorously almost to the
junction of the Bowery and Prince
street, but halted on the suggestion
of a tradesman there, that a reconnoissance
would be a wise movement.
A few were detached to examine the
road. The look up Prince street was
not encouraging. The paving-stones
had actually been carried up in baskets
to the upper stories of the houses,
ready to hurl on the assailants; and
the wall around the churchyard was
pierced for musketry. The mob retreated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
with creditable celerity; but
all that night a feverish anxiety prevailed
around St. Patrick's cathedral;
men stood ready to meet any new
advance, and the mayor, suddenly
riding up, was in some danger, but
was fortunately recognized.</p>

<p>What might have been the scenes
in New York in 1844, when murder
ran riot in Philadelphia! The Natives
had just elected a mayor; the
city would in a few days be in their
hands; a public meeting was called
in the park, and all seemed to promise
a repetition of the scenes in the
sister city. A bold, stern extra issued
from the office of <cite>The Freeman's Journal</cite>
that actually sent terror into the
hearts of the would-be rioters. It
was known at once that the Catholics
would defend their churches to
the last gasp. The firm character of
the archbishop was well known, and
with that to animate the people the
struggle would not be a trifling one.</p>

<p>The call for the meeting was countermanded
and New York was saved;
few knew from what.</p>

<p>To return to the earlier days of the
century. If attacks were made, inquiry
was stimulated. Conversions
to the truth were neither few nor unimportant.
Bishop Bayley mentions
briefly the reception into the church
of one nearly related to himself,
Mrs. Eliza Ann Seton, daughter of
the celebrated Doctor Bayley, and
widow of William Seton, a distinguished
New York merchant. Born
on Staten Island, and long resident
in New York, gracing a high social
position by her charming and noble
character, she made her first communion
in St. Peter's church on the
25th of March, 1805, and in a few
years, giving herself wholly to God,
became, under him, the foundress in
the United States of the Sisters of
Charity, whose quiet labors of love,
and charity, and devotedness in the
cause of humanity and education in
every city in the land seek no herald
here below, but are written deep in
the hearts of grateful millions.</p>

<p>Several Protestant clergymen in
those days returned to the bosom of
unity, such as the Rev. Mr. Kewley, of
St. George's church, New York; Rev.
Calvin White, ancestor of the Shakespeare
scholar, Richard Grant White;
and Mr. Ironsides. Strange, too, was
the conversion of the Rev. Mr. Richards,
sent from New York as a Methodist
preacher to Western New
York and Canada. We follow him,
by his diary, through the sparse settlements
which then dotted that region,
whence he extended his labors
to Montreal. There, good man, in
the zeal of his heart he thought to
conquer Canadian Catholicity by
storming the Sulpitian seminary at
Montreal, converting all there, and so
triumphantly closing the campaign.
His diary of travel goes no further.
Mr. Richards died a few years since,
a zealous and devoted Sulpitian
priest of the seminary at Montreal.</p>

<p>New York was too far from Baltimore
to be easily superintended by
the bishop of that see. His vast
diocese was now to be divided, and
this city was erected into an episcopal
see in 1808, by Pope Pius VII. The
choice for the bishop who was to
give form to the new diocese, fell upon
the Rev. Luke Concanen, a learned
and zealous Dominican, long connected
with the affairs of his order
at Rome. Bishop Bayley gives a characteristic
letter of his. He had persistently
declined a see in Ireland with
its comparative comforts and consolations
among a zealous people; but
the call to a position of toil, the establishment
of a new diocese in a
new land, where all was to be created,
was not an appeal that he could disregard.
He submitted to the charge
imposed upon him, and after receiving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
episcopal consecration at Rome,
prepared to reach his see, wholly ignorant
of what he should find on his
arrival in New York. It was, however,
no easy matter then to secure
passage. Failing to find a ship at
Leghorn, he proceeded to Naples;
but the French, who had overrun Italy,
detained him as a British subject,
and while thus thwarted and harassed,
he suddenly fell sick and died. Thus
New York never beheld its first bishop.</p>

<p>Then followed a long vacancy,
highly prejudicial to the progress of
the church, but a vacancy that European
affairs caused. The successor of
St. Peter was torn from Rome, and
held a prisoner in France. The Catholic
world knew not under what influence
acts might be issued as his,
that were really the inventions of his
enemies. The bishops in Ireland addressed
a letter to the bishops of the
United States to propose some settled
line of action in all cases where there
was not evidence that the pope was
a free agent. The reply of the bishops
in the United States is given in
the volume before us.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Archbishop of Baltimore
extended his care to the diocese
of New York. When Father
O'Brien at last sank under his increasing
years, New York would have
seen its Catholic population in a
manner destitute, had not the Jesuit
fathers of Maryland come to their
assistance. Rev. Anthony Kohlmann,
a man of sound theological
learning and great zeal, who died
many years after at Rome, honored
by the sovereign pontiffs, was the
administrator of the diocese. With
him were Rev. Benedict Fenwick,
subsequently Bishop of Boston, and
Rev. Peter Malou, whose romantic
life would form an interesting volume;
for few who recollect this venerable
priest, in his day such a favorite
with the young, knew that he had
figured in great political events, and
in the struggle of Belgium for freedom
had led her armies.</p>

<p>Under the impulse of these fathers
a collegiate institution was opened,
and continued for some years on the
spot where the new magnificent cathedral
is rising; and old New York
Catholics smiled when a recent scribbler
asserted that the site of that
noble edifice was a gift from the city.
Trinity, the Old Brick church, and
some other churches we could name
were built on land given by the ruling
powers, but no Catholic church
figures in the list. The college was
finally closed, from the fact that difficulties
in Maryland prevented the order
from supplying necessary professors
to maintain its high position.</p>

<p>To secure to young ladies similar
advantages for superior education,
some Ursuline nuns were induced to
cross the Atlantic. They were hailed
with joy, and their academy was
wonderfully successful. The superior
was a lady whose appearance was remarkably
striking, and whose cultivation
and ability impressed all. Unfortunately
they came under restrictions
which soon deprived New York
of them. Unless novices joined them
within a certain number of years, they
were to return to Ireland.</p>

<p>In a new country vocations could
be only a matter of time, and as the
Ursuline order required a dowry, the
vocations of all but wealthy young
ladies were excluded, and even of
these when subject to a guardian.</p>

<p>As the Catholic body had increased,
a new church was begun in a spot
then far out of the city, described
as between the Broadway and the
Bowery road. This was old St. Patrick's,
of which the corner-stone was
laid June 8th, 1809. This was to be
the cathedral of the future bishop;
and the Orphan Asylum, now thriving
under the care of an incorporated society,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
was ere long to be placed near
the new church.</p>

<p>During this period a strange case
occurred in a New York court that
settled for that State, at least, a question
of importance to Catholics. It
settled as a principle of law that the
confession of a Catholic to a priest
was a privileged communication,
which the priest could not be called
upon or permitted to reveal.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Restitution had been made to a man
named James Keating, through the Rev.
Father Kohlmann, of certain goods which
had been stolen from him. Keating had
previously made a complaint against one
Philips and his wife, as having received the
goods thus stolen, and they were indicted
for a misdemeanor before the justices of the
peace. Keating having afterward stated
that the goods had been restored to him
through the instrumentality of Father Kohlmann,
the latter was cited before the court,
and required to give evidence in regard to
the person or persons from whom he had
received them. This he refused to do, on
the ground that no court could require a
priest to give evidence in regard to matters
known to him only under the seal of
confession. Upon the case being sent to
the grand-jury, Father Kohlmann was subpoenaed
to attend before them, and appeared
in obedience to the process, but in respectful
terms again declined answering.
On the trial which ensued, Father Kohlmann
was again cited to appear as a witness
in the case. Having been asked certain
questions, he entreated that he might be
excused, and offered his reasons to the
court. With consent of counsel, the question
was put off for some time, and finally
brought on for argument on Tuesday, the
8th of June, 1813, before a court composed
of the Hon. De Witt Clinton, mayor of the
city; the Hon. Josiah Ogden Hoffman, recorder;
and Isaac S. Douglass, and Richard
Cunningham, Esqs., sitting aldermen.
The Hon. Richard Riker, afterward for so
many years recorder of the city, and Counsellor
Sampson, volunteered their services
in behalf of Father Kohlmann....</p>

<p>"The decision was given by De Witt
Clinton at some length. Having shown that,
according to the doctrine and practice of
the Catholic Church, a priest who should
reveal what he had heard in the confessional
would become infamous and degraded
in the eyes of Catholics, and as no one
could be called upon to give evidence which
would expose him to infamy, he declared
that the only way was to excuse a priest
from answering in such cases."</p></blockquote>

<p>This decision, by the influence of
De Witt Clinton, when Governor of
the State, was incorporated into the
Revised Statutes as part of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex
scripta</i> of the State.</p>

<p>With this period, too began the
publication of Catholic works in New
York, which has since attained such
a wonderful development. Bernard
Dornin stands as the patriarch of the
Catholic book trade of New York, of
which an interesting sketch will be
found in the appendix to Bishop
Bayley's work. He also gives a list of
subscribers to some of the earliest
works, which will possess no little interest
to older Catholic families, who
can here claim ancestors as not only
Catholic, but devoted to their faith,
and anxious to spread its literature.
We have looked over the list, and
amid familiar names have endeavored
to find the oldest now living. If we
do not err greatly, it is the distinguished
lawyer Charles O'Conor, Esq.</p>

<p>When Pope Pius VII. was restored
to Rome, another son of St. Dominic
was chosen; and the Rev. John Connolly
was consecrated the second bishop
of New York. After making
such arrangements as he could in Ireland
for the good of his diocese, he
set sail from Dublin, but experienced
a long and dangerous passage. From
the absence of all notice of any kind,
except the mere fact of his name
among the passengers, his reception
was apparently a most private one.
He was utterly a stranger in a strange
land, called from the studies of the
cloister to form and rule a diocese of
considerable extent, without any previous
knowledge of the wants of his
flock, and utterly without resources.</p>

<p>His diocese, which embraced the
State of New York and part of New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
Jersey, contained but four priests,
three belonging to the Jesuits in Maryland,
and liable to be called away
at any moment, as two were almost
immediately after his arrival. The
college and convent had disappeared,
and the church seemed to have lost
in all but numbers. Thirteen thousand
Catholics were to be supplied
with pastors, and yet the trustee
system stood a fearful barrier in his
way. As Bishop Bayley well observes,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The trustee system had not been behind
its early promise, and trustees of churches
had become so accustomed to have every
thing their own way, that they were not disposed
to allow even the interference of a
bishop.</p>

<p>"In such a state of things, he was obliged
to assume the office of a missionary priest,
rather than a bishop; and many still living
remember the humility and earnest zeal
with which he discharged the laborious duties
of the confessional, and traversed the
city on foot to attend upon the poor and sick.</p>

<p>"Bishop Connolly was not lacking in firmness,
but the great wants of his new diocese
made it necessary for him to fall in, to a
certain extent, with the established order of
things, and this exposed him afterward to
much difficulty and many humiliations."</p></blockquote>

<p>Yet he secured some good priests
and ecclesiastical students from Kilkenny
College, whom he gradually
raised to the priesthood, his first ordination
and the first conferring of
the sacrament of holy orders in the
city being that of the Rev. Michael
O'Gorman in 1815. One only of the
priests ordained by this first bishop
occupying the see of New York still
survives, the Rev. John Shanahan,
now at St. Peter's church, Barclay
street.</p>

<p>Under the care of Bishop Connolly
the Sisters of Charity began their
labors in the city so long the home
of Mother Seton; and, so far as his
means permitted him to yield to his
zeal, he increased the number of
churches and congregations in his
diocese.</p>

<p>The <i>Brief Sketch</i> gives his portrait,
as well as that of his predecessor.</p>

<p>After an episcopate of nearly ten
years, the bishop was taken ill on his
return from the funeral of his first
ordained priest, and soon followed
him to the grave. He died at No.
512 Broadway, on the 5th of February,
1825, and was buried under
the cathedral, after having been exposed
for two days in St. Peter's
church. The ceremonial was imposing
and attracted general attention,
and the remarks of the papers of the
day show the respect entertained for
him by all classes of citizens.</p>

<p>The next bishop of New York was
one well known in the country by his
labors, especially by his successful exertions
in giving the church in our republic
a college and theological seminary
suited to its wants&mdash;Mount St.
Mary's College at Emmettsburg, Maryland.
The life of the Rev. John
Du Bois had been varied. Born in
Paris, he was in college a fellow-student
of Robespierre and Camille
Desmoulins; but actuated by far different
thoughts from those which filled
the brains of such men, he devoted
himself to the service of God. The
revolution found him a laborious
priest at Paris. Escaping in disguise
from France during the Reign of
Terror, through the connivance of
his old fellow-collegian, Robespierre,
he came to America, bearing letters
of introduction from La Fayette to
eminent personages in the United
States.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Having received faculties from Bishop
Carroll, he exercised the holy ministry in
various parts of Virginia and Maryland.
He lived for some time with Mr. Monroe,
afterward President of the United States,
and in the family of Gov. Lee, of Maryland.
After the death of Father Frambach, he
took charge of the mission of Frederick in
Maryland, of which mission he may be said
in reality to have been the founder. When
he arrived there, he celebrated mass in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
large room which served as a chapel, and
afterward built the first church. But
though Frederick was his headquarters, he
did not confine himself to it, but made stations
throughout all the surrounding country,
at Montgomery, Winchester, Hagerstown,
and Emmettsburg, everywhere manifesting
the same earnest zeal and indomitable
perseverance. Bishop Bruté relates, as
an instance of his activity and zeal, that
once, after hearing confessions on Saturday
evening, he rode during the night to near
Montgomery, a distance of thirty-five to forty
miles, to administer the last sacraments
to a dying woman, and was back hearing
confessions in the morning, at the Mountain,
singing high mass and preaching, without
scarcely any one knowing that he had been
absent at all.</p>

<p>"In 1808, the Rev. Mr. Du Bois, having
previously become a member of the Society
of St. Sulpice, in Baltimore, went to reside
at Emmettsburg, and laid the foundation of
Mount St. Mary's College, which was afterward
destined to be the means of so much
usefulness to the Catholic Church in America.
From this point, now surrounded by
so many hallowed associations in the minds
of American Catholics, by the sound religious
education imparted to so many young
men from various parts of the United States,
'by the many fervent and holy priests, trained
under his direction,' and by the prudent
care with which he cherished the rising institute
of the Sisters of Charity at St. Joseph's,
he became the benefactor, not of any
particular locality, but of the whole Catholic
body throughout the United States."</p></blockquote>

<p>On coming to his diocese after his
consecration in Baltimore in October,
1826, he found three churches and
four or six priests in New York City;
a church and one priest at Brooklyn,
Albany, and a few stations elsewhere.
But the trustee system fettered the
progress of Catholicity.</p>

<p>Long devoted to the cause of education
for secular life or the service
of the altar, Bishop Du Bois's fondest
desire was to endow his diocese
with another Mount St. Mary's, but
all his efforts failed. A hospital was
also one of his early projects; but
these and other good works could
spring up only when the way had
been prepared by his trials, struggles,
and sufferings.</p>

<p>During his administration the number
of Catholics increased greatly,
and new churches sprang up in the
city and other parts of the diocese.
Of these various foundations and the
zealous priests of that day many interesting
details are given, to which
we can but refer&mdash;the erection of St.
Mary's, Christ church, Transfiguration,
St. Joseph's, St. Nicholas's, St.
Paul's at Harlem. The services of
the Very Rev. Doctor Power, of Rev.
Felix Varela, of Rev. Messrs. Levins
and Schueller, and other clergymen
of that day are not yet forgotten.</p>

<p>The excitement caused by the Act
of Catholic Emancipation in England
had its counterpart here, stimulated
too by jealousy at the influx of foreign
labor. The church had had her
day of penal laws and wild excitement;
now war was to be made
through the press. About 1835 it
began in New York. The use of
falsehood against Catholicity seems
to be considered by some one of the
higher virtues. Certainly there is a
strange perversion of conscience on
the point. The anti-Catholic literature
of that period is a curiosity that
must cause some cheeks to tingle
if there is any manhood left. They
took up Fulkes's <i>Confutation of the
Rhemish Testament</i>, reprinted the
text from it, and affixed to it a certificate
of several clergymen that it was
a reprint from the original published
at Rheims. It was not. They
caught up a poor creature from a
Magdalen asylum in Montreal, and
concocted a book, laying the scene in
the Hôtel Dieu, commonly called
the Convent of the Black Nuns, at
Montreal. The book was so infamous
that the Harpers issued it under
the name of Howe &amp; Bates.
It was published daily in <cite>The Sun</cite>
newspaper, and had an immense circulation.
Colonel William L. Stone,
a zealous Protestant, went to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
spot, and, there convinced of the
fraud, published an exposure of the
vile slanders. He was assailed in
a satire called <i>The Vision of Rubeta</i>,
and the pious Protestant community
swallowed the filthy details. At last
there arose a quarrel over the spoils.
A triangular lawsuit between the
Harpers, the Rev. Mr. Slocum, and
Maria Monk in the court of chancery
gave some strange disclosures,
more startling than the fictitious ones
of the book. Vice-Chancellor McCoun
in disgust turned them out of
his court, and told them to go before
a jury; but none of them dared to
face twelve honest men.</p>

<p>A paper called <i>The Downfall of
Babylon</i> flourished for a time on this
anti-Catholic feeling, reeking with
lewdness and impurity. At last
their heroine and tool, Maria Monk,
cast off and scouted, ended her days
on Blackwell's Island.</p>

<p>Among the curiosities of this period
was a work of S. F. B. Morse, (we used
in our younger days to think the initials
stood for Savage Furious Bigot,)
entitled <i>Brutus, or a Foreign Conspiracy
against the Liberties of the United
States</i>. The queen of France had given
the Bishop of St. Louis some altar
paintings, and herein was the conspiracy.
We saw a picture the other day of
Mr. Morse with the stars of several
foreign orders of knighthood on his
breast; he has received many, some
from Catholic sovereigns, and, we
believe, one from the pope. Brutus
should certainly take him in hand;
for some of these orders require
knights to swear to things that would
be rather awkward for a zealous Protestant
to undertake. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Et tu Brute!</i></p>

<p>The controversies of that day
would furnish matter for an article
in themselves. They were the topic
of the day, and led to many curious
scenes. Among the Catholic controvertists,
the Rev. Mr. Levins was particularly
incisive and effective; Rev.
Mr. Varela dealt gentler but heavy
blows, being keen in argument and
sound in learning. A tract on the
five different Bibles of the American
Bible Society was one of those occasions
where, departing from the defensive,
the Catholic apologist assumed
the offensive. And this time it
was highly offensive. At that time
the Bible Society published a Spanish
Bible, and Testaments in French,
Spanish, and Portuguese, all Catholic
versions, merely omitting the notes
of the Catholic translators. <i>Appleton's
Cyclopædia</i> asserts that "the
American Bible Society, made up of
materials more thoroughly Puritanic,
and less Lutheran and continental,
... has never published any
other than the canonical (Protestant)
books;" but this is not so. The
Spanish Bible of 1824 contains the
very books which in other editions
they reject absolutely. It is true that
in the edition of 1825 they left them
out of the body of the book, but
kept them in the list of books. After
that they disappeared, while the
title-page still falsely professed to give
the <i>Bible</i> translated by Bishop Scio
de San Miguel, without the slightest
intimation that part of Bishop Scio's
work was omitted. We once bought
Bagster's edition of the Vulgate, and
found ourselves the victim of a similar
fraud.</p>

<p>Mr. Varela exposed the inconsistency
of their publishing in one language
as inspired what they rejected
in another; of translating a passage
in one sense in one volume, and in
another in a Bible standing beside it.
The subject caused a sensation. After
deliberating on the matter, it was
determined to suppress all these Catholic
versions; they were accordingly
withdrawn. The stereotype plates
were melted up; and the printed copies
were, as we were assured, committed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
to the flames, although it took
some time to effect this greatest Bible-burning
ever witnessed in New York.</p>

<p>Meanwhile New York was not
without its organs of Catholic sentiment.
<cite>The Truth-Teller</cite> was for many
years the vehicle of information and
defence. The editor, William Denman,
still survives to witness the
progress made since that day when
he battled almost alone among the
press of the land. <cite>The Catholic Diary</cite>,
and <cite>The Green Banner</cite>, and <cite>The
Freeman's Journal</cite> followed.</p>

<p>While the controversy fever lasted,
some curious scenes took place. Catholics,
especially poor servant-girls,
were annoyed at all times and in all
places, in the street, at the pump&mdash;for
those were not days of Croton
water&mdash;and even in their kitchens.
One Protestant clergyman of New
York had quite a reputation for the
gross indecency that characterized
his valorous attacks of this kind.
The servant of a lady in Beekman
street&mdash;people in good circumstances
lived there then&mdash;was a constant object
of his zeal. One day, report
said, after dining with the lady, he
descended to the kitchen, and began
twitting the girl about the confessional,
and coupling this with the grossest
charges against the Catholic clergy.
The girl bore it for a time, and
when ordering him out of her realm
failed, she seized a poker and dealt
her indecent assailant a blow on the
head that sent him staggering to the
stairs. While he groped his way bewildered
to the parlor, the girl hastened
to her room, bundled up her
clothes, and left the house. The
clergyman was long laid up from the
consequence of his folly, and every
attempt made to hush the matter up;
but an eccentric Catholic of that
day, Joseph Trench, got up a large
caricature representing the scene,
which went like wild-fire, attack being
always popular, and an attack on
the Protestant clergy being quite a
novelty. Trivial as the whole affair
was, it proved more effective than the
soundest theological arguments, and
Mary Ann Wiggins with her poker
really closed the great controversial
period.</p>

<p>It had its good effects, nevertheless,
in making Catholics earnest in
their faith. Their numbers were
rapidly increasing, and with them
churches and institutions. Besides
the Orphan Asylum, an institution for
those who had lost only one parent,
the Half-Orphan Asylum, was commenced
and long sustained, mainly
by the zeal and means of Mr. Glover,
a convert whose name should stand
high in the memory of New York
Catholics. This institution, now
merged in the general Orphan Asylum,
had in its separate existence a
long career of usefulness under the
care of the Sisters of Charity.</p>

<p>Bishop Du Bois was unremitting in
his efforts to increase the number of
his clergy and the institutions of his
diocese. The progress was marked.
Besides clergymen from abroad, he
ordained, or had ordained, twenty-one
who had been trained under his
own supervision, and who completed
their divinity studies chiefly at the
honored institution which he had
founded in Maryland; among these
was Gregory B. Pardow, who was, if
we mistake not, the first native of the
city elevated to the priesthood. Five
of these priests have since been promoted
to the episcopacy, as well as
two others ordained in his time by
his coadjutor.</p>

<p>In manners, Bishop Du Bois was
the polished French gentleman of the
old <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i>; as a clergyman, learned
and strict in his ideas, his administrative
powers were always deemed
great, but in their exercise in his diocese
they were constantly thwarted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
by the trustee system. But he was
not one easily intimidated; and
when the trustees of the cathedral,
in order to force him to act contrary
to the dictates of his own better judgment,
if not his conscience, threatened
to deprive him of his salary, he
made them a reply that is historical,
"Well, gentlemen, you may vote the
salary or not, just as seems good to
you. I do not need much; I can
live in the basement or in the garret;
but whether I come up from the basement,
or down from the garret, I will
still be your bishop."</p>

<p>He had passed the vigor of manhood
when he was appointed to the
see of New York, and the constant
struggle aged him prematurely. It
became necessary for him to call for
a younger hand to assist. The position
was one that required a singularly
gifted priest. The future of Catholicity
in New York depended on
the selection of one who, combining
the learning and zeal of the missionary
priest with that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">donum famæ</i>
which gives a man influence over his
fellow-men, and that skill in firm but almost
imperceptible government which
is the characteristic of a great ruler,
could place Catholicity in New York
on a firm, harmonious basis, instinct
with the true spirit of life, that would
insure its future success. Providence
guided the choice. Surely no man
more confessedly endowed with all
these qualities could have been selected
than the Rev. John Hughes,
trained by Bishop Du Bois at Mount
St. Mary's, and then a priest of the
diocese of Philadelphia, where his
dialectic skill had been evinced in a
long and well-maintained controversy.</p>

<p>The final overthrow of the trustee
system gave the church freedom,
and new institutions of every kind
which had been imperatively required
sprang up. A college at Fordham,
the forerunner of the several Catholic
colleges of the State, was soon founded;
a convent of Ladies of the Sacred
Heart, for the education of
young ladies; Sisters of Mercy with
their various important labors came
to help the good work. But now a
large German Catholic immigration
began. Bishop Hughes saw the
want and the means; a development
of the German churches, especially
under the care of the Redemptorist
fathers, soon followed.</p>

<p>The position of the Catholic children
in regard to their participation
in those educational advantages next
attracted his care. The prevalent
spirit in those institutions for which
Catholics as well as Protestants were
taxed was essentially anti-Catholic;
the books used were often vile in
their character, whenever Catholicity
was touched upon. Think of Huntington's
Geography with a picture at
Asia of "Pagan Idolatry," and at
Italy of "Roman Catholic Idolatry."
Think of an arithmetic&mdash;Pike's, we believe&mdash;with
a question like this, "If a
pope can pray a soul out of purgatory
in three days, a cardinal in four, and
a bishop in six, how long would it
take all three to pray them out?" A
Catholic girl in the Rutgers Female
Institute, when the geography was
given to her, happened to open to
Italy, and, outraged at the wanton
insult to her feelings, threw the book
on the floor, burst into tears, and left
the school; but Rutgers Female Institute
could use such books as they
chose, and Catholics could send there
or elsewhere. It was not a State
creation, supported by taxes drawn
from all; but did any right exist to
force Catholics to the alternative of
submitting to such degrading insults
or keep aloof from schools which
they were taxed to support? or rather,
the question was, Could Catholics
in the State of New York be compelled
to support the Protestant
church and aid in its extension?</p>

<p>Bishop Bayley sketches briefly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
other important acts of the administration
of Bishop Hughes, and concludes,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"But though much has been done, much
remains to be accomplished. The 'two
hundred Catholics' of 1785 were better provided
for than the two hundred thousand
who now (1853) dwell within the boundaries
of the city of New York. It is true that
no exertions could have kept pace with the
tide of emigration which has been pouring
in upon our shores, especially during the
last few years. The number of priests,
churches, and schools, rapidly as they have
increased, are entirely inadequate to the
wants of our Catholic population, and render
it imperative that every exertion should
be made to supply the deficiency. What
has been done so far has, by God's blessing,
been accomplished by the Catholics of New
York themselves. Comparatively very little
assistance has been received from the liberality
of our brethren in other countries.
And while we have done so much for ourselves,
we have contributed liberally toward
the erection of churches and other
works of piety in various parts of the United
States.</p>

<p>"Though the Catholic Church in this country
has increased much more largely by
conversions than is generally supposed, yet,
for the most part, its rapid development
has been owing to the emigration of Catholics
from foreign countries; and, if we desire
to make this increase permanent, and
to keep the children in the faith of their fathers,
we must, above all things, take measures
to imbue the minds of the rising generation
of Catholics with sound religious
principles. This can only be done by giving
them a good Catholic education. In
our present position, the school-house has
become second in importance only to the
house of God itself. We have abundant
cause for thankfulness to God on account
of the many blessings which he has conferred
on us; but we will show ourselves
unworthy of these blessings if we do not
do all that is in our power to promote every
good work by which they may be increased
and confirmed to those who shall come after
us."</p></blockquote>

<p>And though we may now rate the
number of Catholics in the city at
four hundred thousand, the language
is still applicable.</p>

<p>There are now, we may add, forty
Catholic churches on the island, with
parish schools educating twenty-one
thousand children of both sexes; houses
of Jesuits, Redemptorists, Fathers
of Mercy, Paulists, Franciscans, Capucins,
Dominicans; convents of the
Sacred Heart, houses of Sisters of
Charity, Sisters of the Good Shepherd,
of Notre Dame, of the order of St.
Dominic, of the Poor of St. Francis,
and of the Third Order of St. Francis;
several orphan asylums, two hospitals,
reformatories for boys and
girls, a house of protection for servants,
a home for destitute children,
a home for aged women, and a
foundling asylum just begun. Yet it
is but true that all this is little for the
wants of four hundred thousand Catholics.</p>

<p>Glancing back to the early history,
we see in all the work of the many.
In comparison, we have had fewer
men of wealth than those around us;
but it must also be added that among
those few there have been still fewer,
in proportion, to identify their names
with the great religious works. As
we look around through the country,
we see great institutions, churches,
colleges, libraries, asylums, each the
act of a single man of wealth; but
we cannot show in New York a single
such Catholic work. There are
monuments in our great cemeteries,
on each of which more money has
been expended than would erect a
church in some neglected part of
New York. Which would be the nobler
monument?</p>

<p>We trust that this work, full of interest
as it is to all, will circulate
widely among the Catholics of New
York and bring home to all that respect
to their predecessors, respect to
themselves, requires of all to take in
hand earnestly what yet remains to
do to give us what are absolutely required
for worship, for instruction,
for the works of mercy.</p>

<h2>THE TRUE ORIGIN OF GALLICANISM.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></h2>


<p>A curious book has lately appeared
in France. It is not so much the
production of the pen as the result
of the judicious industry of M. Gérin,
judge of the civil tribunal of Paris.
In his introduction to the work he
says that it is not his intention to
write a book, but to put together materials
for history and for the better
understanding of a vital question,
which has agitated the French world
especially for three hundred years&mdash;the
infallibility of the sovereign pontiff
and his superiority to a general
council of bishops. It would be difficult
to exaggerate the speculative
value as well as the practical importance
of this doctrine. M. Gérin
has rendered an inestimable service
to historic truth and to the church by
showing the origin of the so-called
Gallican doctrine, which denied the
infallibility of the pontiff, contrary to
the practice and opinion that had prevailed
among Christians for fifteen or
sixteen hundred years. It is not our
intention to prove the possessive or
prescriptive right of this doctrine.
This has been amply done in our
day in English by several authors,
while the work of the brothers Ballerini
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>and Zaccharia's reply to Hontheim,
the well-known Anti-Febronius,
are open to the study of the learned.
What we shall do will be to follow
M. Gérin in showing the base origin
of a teaching which no array of brilliant
names can make legitimate.</p>

<p>At the outset we acknowledge the
difficulty of the task. The work is
so tersely and so logically compiled
that one is at a loss how to break in
upon so connected a recital, lest it
should impair the effect of what he
selects, by detaching it from its antecedents
as well as from its consequents.
But as all may not, at least
for some time, have it in their power
to read a translation of this interesting
volume, we shall risk something
for their information.</p>

<p>It has been commonly supposed
that the Gallican doctrine was generally
held by the French clergy during
the reign of Louis XIV., and that
in ordering it to be taught throughout
his kingdom that sovereign only
seconded the desire of his prelates
and people. Never has a more unfounded
idea been foisted upon credulity.
No one ever heard of any such
doctrine before the Chancellor Gerson
at the Council of Constance hesitatingly
broached it, in order to apply
it, if possible, as a remedy and preventive
of schism in the church.
Like all opinions not well ventilated
and examined, it found some who favored
it, and at the schismatical assembly
of Basle it acquired a number
of followers. These, however, were
soon obliged to yield; and in the
Council of Florence a dogmatic decree
was drawn up and adopted by
the fathers, and confirmed by the sovereign
pontiff, which declared the latter
to be possessed of the <i>full and
supreme jurisdiction of Peter</i>, and the
doctor or teacher of the universal
church&mdash;a phrase that implied the infallibility
of the pope; for a teacher is
rightly so called only when he possesses
the principles of his branch
in such a way as to impart the degree
of certainty peculiar to it. The
church possesses the assistance of
Christ, and is, therefore, infallible; and
the organ or teacher of that church
must have that same assistance which
shall make him infallible. Otherwise
we would have the, to say the least,
strange consequence that ordinarily
the church is liable to be misled; extraordinarily
only&mdash;for councils must
from their nature be unusual&mdash;is she
to be regarded as free from error. It
should be borne in mind that this
definition of the &oelig;cumenical synod,
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1439, was made after due consultation;
for when Eugenius IV. had
caused his rights and prerogatives to
be discussed before him by the Greek
and Latin theologians, the Greeks, on
leaving the presence of the pontiff,
went to the emperor of Constantinople,
then in Florence, and renewed
before him the examination of the
question. The result was, that they
did not oppose the teaching of the
papal doctors, but merely required
two rights for their party: one, that
no council should be called without
the emperor; and the other, that in
case of appeal the patriarchs should
not be obliged to present themselves
for judgment, but that legates should
be sent into the province in question
to try the cause. Not a word was
said against the doctrines. The pope
refused to grant these requests, and
the emperor broke off negotiations.
Still, through the mediation of influential
prelates on both sides, they
were resumed again immediately; and
the Greek fathers acknowledged the
Roman pontiff "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">locum gerentem et
vicarium Christi, pastorem et doctorem
omnium Christianorum, regentem et
gubernantem Dei Ecclesiam</span>"&mdash;to
hold the place of Christ and to be his
vicar, the pastor and doctor of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
Christians, the ruler and head of the
church. A few days afterward, the
formal dogmatic definition was given
by the united fathers of both churches,
confirmed by the pope, and subscribed
by him, by the cardinals, the
emperor John Pal&oelig;ologus, and the
Greek and Latin fathers of the council,
with the exception of one, Mark,
Bishop of Ephesus, whose bad faith
in quoting the Greek manuscripts
was accidentally made known to the
whole council. His servant had
erased the wrong passage, which fact
the bishop did not discover until he
was reading the code in public. The
words of the definition are these:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We define that the holy apostolic see
and the Roman pontiff hold the primacy
throughout the whole world; that the same
Roman pontiff is the successor of blessed
Peter, prince of the apostles, and the true
vicar of Christ, the head of the whole church,
and the father and doctor of all Christians;
that to him, in blessed Peter, was given by
our Lord Jesus Christ full power to feed,
rule, and govern the universal church, as is
contained, also, in the acts of &oelig;cumenical
councils and in the sacred canons."</p></blockquote>

<p>It was impossible for Gallican theologians
to ignore the force of thesekat' hon eropon
words. To elude it they had recourse
to the last phrase, "<em>as</em> is contained
in the acts of &oelig;cumenical councils
and in the sacred canons," and appealed
to tradition to explain the
meaning of the fathers of Florence.
Their meaning, however, is clear from
what they determined on a few days
before the decision. In their written
declaration that phrase is not found.
Moreover, the phrase itself is in corroboration
of the decision; for in reality
tradition bears out fully the doctrine
it contains. The Greek text of
Cardinal Bessarion has this phrase,
<span lang="gr" xml:lang="gr">&#954;&#945;&#964; &#8001;&#957; &#949;&#961;&#8057;&#960;&#959;&#957;</span>&mdash;"according to the
manner"&mdash;and it is this that the Gallic
doctors thought favored them.
This wording does not, however, alter
the sense we have given. With regard
to the phrase itself, learned men, and
among them the author of <i>Anti-Febronius</i>,
state that in the original document
such an appendage had no
existence whatsoever. With this decision
before them, how did it happen
that such teaching as at a later date
obtained the ascendency in France,
and in some other parts of Europe,
could have met with favor? The
work of M. Gérin answers this question
clearly, and shows that intrigue
and royal influence and power did
the work.</p>

<p>The documents with which he
opens his collection refer to the year
1663. They, for the most part, have
hitherto been entirely unknown, and
were found by M. Gérin among the
<span class="smcap">MSS.</span> of the time of Louis XIV. in the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bibliothèque Impériale</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">MSS.</span> Colbert.
At that time ill-humor existed between
the French and Papal courts,
growing out of a quarrel between the
servants of the French ambassador at
Rome. This was settled for the moment;
but on the appointment of the
Duc de Créqui, the feuds were renewed,
owing to the disposition of
that ambassador, whose pride had
been wounded by his having been
obliged to pay the first visits to the
relatives of the pope, who were in the
first places of the government. The
retainers of the duke on the 12th of
August, 1662, attacked and beat the
Corsican guard in the service of the
pope. The pope sent an envoy to
visit the duke, who pretended that an
attempt had been made on his life.
Instead of receiving the messenger
of the pontiff graciously, he threatened
to throw him out of the window,
and refused all apologies. This was
a spark thrown into other inflammable
matter that brought on an invasion
of the papal territory, and other still
worse disasters to the church. The
king, as a consequence of his difficulties
with the pope, became surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
with evilly-disposed counsellors,
whom, to do him justice, he sometimes
curbed. It was during this
political trouble that the enemies of
Rome sought to deal her a blow fatal
to her influence. The Jansenist opinions
had received a severe condemnation
in the decrees of the sovereign
pontiff and through the action of
Louis XIV. Those who professed
them were obliged to sign a formula
of submission to the church, and receive
the doctrine of Rome. There
were many who, while they did so,
still held to the erroneous teachings
of their sect. Among these there
was an Abbé Bourseis, a man of some
ability, but of more tact in courtly
life. In 1661, on the 12th of December,
a bachelor of theology defended
the following thesis:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We acknowledge Christ head of the
church in such a manner that he, on ascending
to heaven, intrusted the government of
it first to Peter, and afterward to his successors,
and gave them the same infallibility
he himself possessed, whenever they should
speak authoritatively, (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex cathedra</i>.) There
is, therefore, in the Roman church an infallible
judge of controversy regarding faith,
even apart from general councils, in questions
both of right and of fact."</p></blockquote>

<p>About the same time, the Abbé
Bourseis seized upon this opportunity
and gained over the minister Colbert;
while the son of the minister Letellier
brought over his father. The
thesis was represented as an attempt
of the Jesuits against the government.
About the same time, Drouet
de Villeneuve, a bachelor of the College
of Navarre, defended the same
doctrine in substance. The advocate-general
was instructed to proceed
in the case. The parliament having
been informed of what had occurred,
issued a decree against the thesis, on
the 22d of January, 1663, forbidding
any one to write, hold, or teach such
propositions under penalty of being
proceeded against by the courts; and
commanded this decree to be placed
on the register of the said faculty of
Paris. The parliament deputed two
counsellors of the court, and Achille
de Harlay, the substitute of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">procureur-général</i>,
to have the decree registered.
These persons repaired to
the Sorbonne on the 31st January,
1663. "Despite the menaces addressed
to the indocile doctors, by
Talon, the advocate-general, and Harlay,
the faculty refused to obey; and
only agreed to take the matter into
consideration."<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
M. de Mincé and
M. de Breda, favorable to the government,
said the faculty had not
changed its sentiments and did not
approve the thesis. No conclusion
was come to; the discussion was adjourned
to the 1st. Nothing, however,
was done on the first nor on the 5th
of February. On the 9th, the archbishops
of Auch and of Paris were
present. The first spoke against the
decree and action of the parliament;
the second said no opposition should
be made to the decree, but that the
faculty would be able to arrange
things in a satisfactory manner if they
discussed the matter amicably with
the first president of the parliament.
The Archbishop of Auch said that
general councils were necessary only
against schism; the rest, against heresy
as well as schism, but for nothing
else. No conclusion was reached.
On the 15th of February, M.
de Breda reported, and read the answer
of the first president, and, hearing
a great uproar, said he was astonished
to see those present so excited
against the parliament. M. Grandin,
syndic of the faculty, to justify himself
for having signed the thesis, spoke
for a long time, and tried to give a
good meaning to the thesis, and explained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
the third proposition, touching
the need of general councils, in
the same way as the Archbishop of
Auch. M. de Mincé wished the decree
registered. M. Morel thought
it ought not to be registered before
the thesis had been censured. He
quoted some text of St. Gregory
Nazianzen, adding that, if it were registered,
the faculty would be like the
statue of Memnon. He was followed
in his opinion by M. Amiot. The
Rev. P. Nicolai, MM. Bail, Joisel,
Chamillard, and all the doctors of St.
Sulpice, and of the house of Chardonnet,
were of the same opinion, and
declaimed strongly against the harangue
of the substitute, Achille de
Harlay. M. Lestocq, professor of the
Sorbonne, wished to prove the decree
null both in matter and form. M.
Chamillard the younger said the
Council of Constance was not received,
and that its doctrine was only
probable; but the greater part of the
doctors having risen against him, he
was obliged to say it had been received
in part. M. Bossuet<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
here made
a feint of bringing forward a new project;
upon which Leblond, professor
of the Sorbonne, Bonst, also professor,
Joisel and Blanger, of the Sorbonne,
following the advice of the Père Nicolai,
left their places in an indignant
manner, saying that the harangue of
the substitute ought to be censured.
All the professors of the Sorbonne,
without exception, the fathers Louvet
and Hermant, Bernardines and
professors in their house, spoke bitterly
against the parliament; and when
the Père Hermant undertook to prove
the infallibility of the pope and his superiority
over a council, he was followed
by nearly all the monks.</p>

<p>On the 15th, MM. Pignay, Bail,
Nicolai, Chaillon, dean of Beauvais,
Joisel, and all the professors of the
Sorbonne without exception, as also
MM. Magnay and Charton, opposed
the registering.</p>

<p>The chief instructor of the bachelor
Villeneuve, the Abbé de Tilloy, who
had signed the thesis, and M. Joisel
wished the decree registered with the
explanations of M. Grandin. M. Leblond,
professor of the Sorbonne, and
M. Lestocq concluded that it was
agreed on that the registering should
be accepted with these explanations.
M. Guyard, of Navarre, said that to
do so was to accuse the good faith
of those who had drawn up the conclusion,
which had passed by advice
of MM. de Mincé and de Breda.
The Rev. Fathers de la Barmondière
and Leblanc, of St. Sulpice, accused
the faculty of mortal sin, and
the latter said it was through cowardice
and fear of the temporal power
that the decree was registered. M.
Cornet, the head professor of Navarre,
was not present at these assemblies.</p>

<p>The decree, says M. Gérin, was
registered on the 4th of April; but on
the same day a thesis similar to the
one it condemned was maintained,
with the approbation of the syndic of
the faculty, in the college of the Bernardines,
by the Frère Laurent Desplantes.
On the 14th of April, in
consequence of this being denounced
by royal agents, the parliament cited
before it M. Grandin, the syndic, the
professor presiding at the thesis, the
disputant, and the superiors of the
Bernardines. Talon, the advocate-general,
spoke with great warmth.
"Strange," he said in his prosecution,&mdash;"strange,
that, with unexampled
rashness, they have dared to renew
these evil propositions on the very
day the decree was registered in the
faculty." Grandin held out against
the storm, and the parliament suspended
him from his duties. This
rigor frightened the timid, and some
days afterward the court received a
number of equivocal propositions,
subscribed by sixty-six doctors only.
The whole number was over seven
hundred. M. Deslions, of the Sorbonne,
in his <span class="smcap">MS.</span> journal,<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
lets us into
the secret of the way in which these
six propositions were gotten up. They
are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1. It is not the doctrine of the faculty
that the sovereign pontiff has any authority
over the temporal rights of the most Christian
king; on the contrary, the faculty always
opposed those who favored that authority,
even understood as indirect only.</p>

<p>"2. It is the doctrine of the faculty that
the most Christian king acknowledges and
has no superior at all in temporal matters
except God; and this is its ancient doctrine,
from which it will never recede.</p>

<p>"3. It is the doctrine of the faculty that
subjects owe fidelity and obedience to the
most Christian king in such a way that they
can be dispensed from them under no pretext.</p>

<p>"4. It is the doctrine of the faculty that
they neither approve nor have approved
any proposition, contrary to the authority
of the most Christian king, or to the genuine
(<i>germanis</i>) liberties of the Gallican
Church and canons received in the realm,
v. g., that the sovereign pontiff can depose
bishops in despite of these canons.</p>

<p>"5. It is not the doctrine of the faculty
that the sovereign pontiff is above an &oelig;cumenical
council.</p>

<p>"6. It is not the doctrine of the faculty
that the sovereign pontiff is infallible if no
consent of the church support him, (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nullo accedente
ecclesiæ consensu</i>.)"</p></blockquote>

<p>With regard to these propositions,
M. Deslions writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"M. Bouthillier, doctor of the Sorbonne,
and later member of the assembly of 1682,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
and Bishop of Troyes, told me that, in the
conference held among the doctors deputed
to draw up the six articles presented to the
king on the part of the Sorbonne, in the
first article, which concerns the deposition
of kings, the phrase 'on no pretext,' (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nullo
prætextu</i>,) was purposely inserted; and that
thereupon some one present objected the
case of heresy. M. Morel then said that
this would be a <em>reason</em>, and not a simple <em>pretext</em>,
for deposing a king. He told me, also,
that he had seen in the <span class="smcap">MS.</span> of M. Grandin,
at the sixth article, that the pope is not infallible
<i>if some kind of consent</i> of the church
do not support him. They resolved to put
instead of this, <i>if no consent</i> support him;
which is the same thing, and in some way
less even. So true is it that these articles
were drawn up in the most equivocal language
the framers could suitably employ.
M. Bouthillier learned this of M. Gobinet,
one of the deputies."</p></blockquote>

<p>In confirmation of this, M. Gérin
quotes a comment on these articles
made by Pinsson, advocate of the
parliament, by order of Colbert. He
qualifies all the propositions as equivocal
or captious. He says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1. This first proposition is captious; it
should have been general, affirmative, specific,
etc.</p>

<p>"2. The king did not need the avowal of
the faculty to prove that he knows no superior
in temporal matters, this avowal being
much more advantageous to the popes
themselves, who have recognized it, as does
Pope Innocent III., cap. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Per venerabilem</i>,
in the decretals.</p>

<p>"3. This repetition too often made of the
words 'most Christian king' was unnecessary
for Frenchmen, and it would have been
less suspicious and more advantageous if, in
speaking of the king, they had given to him
no title, etc.</p>

<p>"4. This fourth is equivocal and suspicious,
etc.</p>

<p>"5. The affectation of framing the fifth
article in negative expressions cannot but be
suspicious, etc.</p>

<p>"6. The last article should not have been
conceived in negative terms, but in affirmative;
to wit, that the pope of himself is not
infallible without the consent of the universal
church. And the phrase, 'If no consent
of the church support him,' is too equivocal
in this place," etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>The offer, in the name of the faculty,
of these propositions put a stop to
the difficulty for the time, and the
settlement of the question of redress
so unjustifiably and tyrannically urged
by Louis XIV. against the holy
see brought with it an external appearance
of peace, while it left a
rankling wound that was to break
out afresh in the contests concerning
the <i>regale</i>, or so-styled "royal perquisite,"
seventeen years later.</p>

<p>"This question of the <i>regale</i>," says
M. Gérin, "was of a date much anterior
to the time of Louis XIV." It
consisted in the vindication by the
crown of a presumed title to the revenues
of certain dioceses, and to the
nomination of persons to hold benefices
in the same, upon the death or
removal of the bishop, and until the
newly nominated bishop had taken
the oath of fealty, and had registered
it in the chancellor's chamber, this
act being styled the closure of the
royal right, or <i>regale</i>. The Council
of Lyons had authorized this custom
with regard to bishoprics in which it
had been established as a condition
in their foundation, or had existed as
an ancient practice; while it expressly
forbade its introduction with respect
to those dioceses in which it
had not been received.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The parliaments undertook, however,
to make the custom one of universal application,
compelling the dioceses claiming exemption
to prove their title to be free from it.</p>

<p>"Henry IV. by an edict of 1606, art. 27,
declared, 'We do not intend to enjoy the
right of royal perquisite (<i>regale</i>) save in the
manner in which we and our predecessors
have done, without extending it further to
the prejudice of churches exempt from it.'
This edict was registered in the parliament
of Paris without modification; but on the
24th of August, 1608, the same parliament
pronounced a decree conceived in these
terms: 'The court declares the king to
have a right to the royal perquisite from the
church of Belley, as from every other in his
kingdom;' and forbidding advocates to put
forward any proposition to the contrary.
The clergy complained to the king, who by
letters of 1609 yielded the execution of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
decree. Louis XIII. seemed favorable to
the rights of the church; but after the accession
of Louis XIV. these rights were menaced
more than ever, and 'there was no assembly
of the clergy,' particularly after the
year 1638, in which a special commission
was not named to attend to the subject of
royal perquisite."<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>That of 1670 presented a remonstrance
to the king through the Archbishop
of Embrun; but in 1673 and
1675, two royal declarations appeared
to the effect that all the churches
of the kingdom were subject to the
right of royal perquisite; and that
the archbishops and bishops who had
not yet closed it by registering their
oath should go through that formality
within six months.</p>

<p>Caulet, Bishop of Pamiers, and Pavillon,
Bishop of Alet, standing on
their rights as secured by the custom
of exemption, and by the canons of
the general Council of Lyons, refused
to obey. The result was a contest
between the civil and ecclesiastical
powers, in which Rome of necessity
became engaged. Unheard-of harshness,
and cruelty even, were used
against the clergymen who opposed
the government. One vicar-general
was condemned to death. Unhappily,
there were many ecclesiastics, who
had been provided with benefices by
the government, who not only took
sides with it, but, being interested,
were active in keeping up a quarrel
the solution of which, in accordance
with the views of Rome, would have
proved ruinous to them. They sold
Christ for a few pieces of money.
The deputies of the clergy in 1680, in
their regular quinquennial assembly,
at the request of Louis XIV., wrote a
flattering letter in favor of his claims
and against the pope. This caused
Madame de Sévigné to criticise them
caustically. When speaking of the
two prelates mentioned above, she
says, after referring to the then Bishop
of Alet, who had succeeded Pavillon,
"But the shade of his saintly
predecessor, and M. de Pamiers&mdash;have
they signed that letter of flattery?"</p>

<p>But what were the means used to
bring about the assembly of 1682, in
which the four articles of which so
much has been said were framed?
That which we have recounted up to
this was only the preparation of the
soil; the seed was now to be sown,
and fostered with all the care of royal
interest. M. Gérin quotes from the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Procès Verbaux du Clérgé</i>, t. v.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The general agents or procurators of
the clergy" (these agents resided permanently
in Paris to protect the interests of
the church in case of collision with the
state, or in matters partly ecclesiastical and
partly secular) "were counselled to present
a memorial to the king, and to pray
his majesty to allow them to call together
the prelates who were in Paris, on business
connected with their churches, in order that
through their singular prudence they might
find means to restore peace and put every
thing in order. The king having permitted
this assembly, it was held during the months
of March and of May, 1681, in the archiepiscopal
palace of Paris."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is humiliating to a Catholic to
have to make the avowal, but it is
well known that royal patronage had
well-nigh ruined the French Church,
and that not a few bishops unworthy
of the name occupied high and influential
places. This assembly, known
as "the Little Assembly," (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Petite
Assemblée</i>,) met the day after the order
was given. Fifty bishops, of
whom the great majority ought to
have been at their posts of duty, were
basking in the sunshine of royal favor,
and it was these Louis XIV.
called on for advice. Racine has a
sarcastic epigram on them, which M.
Gérin quotes:</p>

<div class="cpoem" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Un ordre, hier venu de S. Germain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Veut qu'on s'assemble; on s'assemble demain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Notre archévêque et cinquante-deux autres,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Successeurs des apôtres,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
<span class="i0">S'y trouveront. Or, de savoir quel cas<br /></span>

<span class="i4">C'est seulement chose très claire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Que nous avions cinquante-deux prélats<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Qui ne residaient pas."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The advice these prelates gave was
what might have been expected from
the state of things at the time.</p>

<p>They indorsed the action of the
government on four points of discussion
with the holy see:</p>

<p>1. The royal perquisite, which Fleury
and Bossuet could not approve.</p>

<p>2. The book of the Abbé Gerbais,
censured by Rome as schismatical,
suspected of heresy, and injurious to
the holy see; but which they found
full of good doctrine and of deep
learning.</p>

<p>3. In the affair of Charonne.
This was a case of exemption from
royal nomination in which the king
had violated that right. The religious
women of the convent of Charonne,
near Paris, which belonged to
the Augustinian rule, enjoyed the privilege,
recognized by the civil power,
of electing every three years their
superior. Louis XIV., however, in
1676, named for their superior a Cistercian
nun, whom the Archbishop
of Paris, Harlay de Champvallon, acknowledged,
and to whom he gave
the position. The religious appealed
to the sovereign pontiff, who, by a
brief dated August 7th, 1680, annulled
the act of the archbishop, and
ordered them to proceed to the triennial
election, and take for their superior
one of their own number.</p>

<p>4. In the affair of the diocese of
Pamiers, of which we have spoken
above.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On the 2d of May the assembly resolved
to ask the king to call a national council,
or general assembly of the clergy, composed
of two deputies of the first order and
two of the second from each province, the
latter to have a consulting voice only. The
other details were to be arranged according
to the advice of the commissaries."<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The action of this assembly was
much criticised and was disapproved
by the people, as can be seen, according
to M. Gérin's statement, in the
<span class="smcap">MSS.</span> of St. Sulpice, i. ii. iii.; Bibl. Mazarine,
<span class="smcap">MSS.</span> 2392, 2398 fr. From
these he makes several long and interesting
extracts.</p>

<p>In consequence of this resolution
of the Little Assembly, "the king, on
the 16th of July, 1681, addressed letters
of convocation to the agents of
the clergy, through whom the archbishops
of the territory subject to his
majesty were charged to hold provincial
assemblies and cause to be chosen
two deputies of the first order and
two of the second, for the general assembly
assigned for the 1st of October,
1681."</p>

<p>Before entering upon a history of
this body, M. Gérin gives a clear idea
of the question at issue between the
king and the pontiff, and shows that
it was of the same nature as that
which caused the struggle, in which
the church was finally victorious, between
Gregory VII. and the German
emperor, Henry IV. The appointment
of proper pastors for the
flock was at stake. Rome sought
likewise to put a stop to the abuse
by which laymen were pensioned on
dioceses, whose funds ought to have
been devoted to supplying the spiritual
wants of the people, and relieving
the poor and orphans. The church
was in imminent danger of servitude,
spiritual and temporal, as Fleury himself
states. So far had the usurpation
of ecclesiastical jurisdiction gone
that, when Louis XIV., at Strasburg,
gave audience to the bishop of that
place, the act of the king in putting
his hand on the crozier of the prelate
as he leant forward to hear him was
interpreted as a resumption of investiture
by the ring and crozier. Pelisson,
however, the intimate friend of
the king, tells us this was not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
case, as he heard him say afterward
that such an idea had not occurred to
him; but as the prelate spoke in a
rather low tone, he bent toward him
and leaned for support on the crozier.</p>

<p>The government of Louis had
wished this assembly for its own
ends; it was therefore determined
that nothing should be left undone to
secure a favorable result. The temper
of all the members of the French
hierarchy was known: there were
some who were feared&mdash;these were to
be passed by; some who were doubted&mdash;these
were to be allured to compliance;
others there were whose
worldly spirit and indebtedness to the
crown left no uncertainty as to their
course&mdash;these were to be put forward,
honored, and made the leaders in the
movement against Rome. Colbert,
ably seconded by the worldly Harlay
de Champvallon, Archbishop of Paris,
set about the work. His master was
all-powerful; every thing but true virtue
was to bend before him. Canonical
forms were to be superseded if
found to be trammels, and persons
who contradicted were to be made to
feel the weight of royal displeasure.
The legislative bodies even had been
reduced to a state of passive instrumentality,
so that, in 1672, a conscientious
bishop of Languedoc complained
to Colbert that votes were
given without discussion, and protested
that explanations should be made in
regard to the advantages or the necessity
of the expenses the states were
called on to vote. In this state of
things, the Little Assembly had been
convened and had acted the part we
have seen. Before closing its sessions
it named a commission under the
presidency of Harlay, without whose
bidding it was to do nothing. This
commission drew up the project of
procuration, and, by order of the
king, no mention was made of the
part he had had in it. On the 16th
of June, 1681, Colbert writes to the
archbishop:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>: You will find accompanying this
a copy of the letter of the king, as approved
by his majesty, for the convocation of the
general assembly of the clergy, in which
you will remark that no mention is made of
the plan of procuration, placed by you in my
hands. His majesty has thought that nothing
should appear as coming from him
that might determine the matters to be acted
on in the said assemblage; but he has
resolved to give orders on this subject <i>by
word of mouth</i> to the general agents of the
clergy, and to direct that this project or
plan of procuration be sent to the archbishops,
with the explanation that it has been
drawn up by commissioners named at the
late assembly, for the purpose of being sent
to all parts; to make known what ought to
be treated of in the said assembly, and to
bring about uniformity of powers; and in
order to cause the provincial assemblies to
give powers of procuration to the deputies
of the general assembly, conformably to the
project, his majesty will direct that the
intendants of provinces be written to, to
command them to impart to the archbishops
his intentions on the subject of the procuration."</p></blockquote>

<p>M. Gérin gives us here the text of
this plan of procuration; it is from a
<span class="smcap">MS.</span> annotated by the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">procureur-général</i>
De Harlay, brother of the archbishop.
The deputies are</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"To repair to the said city of Paris, according
to the letters of the king and of the
said agents, and there deliberate, in the
manner contained in the resolution of the
said assemblies of March and May, (the Little
Assembly,) on the means of reconciling
the variances respecting the royal right of
perquisite (<i>regale</i>) between the pope, on the
one side, and the king, on the other; to determine
on all the acts which they shall
deem necessary to put an end to these variances,
with the deputies of other provinces,
the same to sign the clauses and conditions
that the assembly shall judge fitting; they
are likewise charged and expressly commanded
to employ all proper means to repair
the infractions committed by the court of
Rome in the decrees of the concordat <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de causis
et de frivolis appellationibus</i> in the affairs
of Charonne, of Pamiers, of Toulouse, and
others which may have or shall have transpired;
to preserve the jurisdiction of the ordinaries
of the realm, and the various degrees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
of it in the form sanctioned by the
concordat; to cause the pope, in case of
appeal to Rome, to depute commissaries in
France to judge it; to procure, by all sorts
of due and proper means, the preservation
of the maxims and liberties of the Gallican
Church; to pass the resolutions by a plurality
of votes, and, for the reasons explained
above, to frame all acts that shall be required,
even though there be any thing demanding
a more special commission than is contained
in these presents, promise being given
that all that shall have been granted and
signed by them shall be agreed to and observed
inviolably in every particular, according
to its form and tenor."</p></blockquote>

<p>The government foresaw that the
second order of the clergy, the simple
priests, would make an attempt to
vindicate their right to a voice. For
this reason it determined to have a
precedent by which to act. The
Archbishop of Rheims, who was in
the interest of the government, convoked
his provincial assembly at Senlis;
the second order protested; its
voice was stifled, and the plan of procuration
accepted. An account of
the proceedings was made out and
sent to the king, by whose command
copies were immediately transmitted
to the intendants of the kingdom
with orders to instruct the archbishops
to do the same in like cases.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
As for the choice of deputies, that
was to be made without any appearance
or direct proof of royal intervention.
But the names of the deputies
show the pressure that must
have been brought to bear by the
court. M. Gérin quotes here a number
of documents in which the royal
interference is manifest. Thus Colbert
writes to the Archbishop of
Rouen:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="signature">

"<span class="smcap">Fontainebleau</span>, Sept. 21, 1681.<br />
</p>

<p>"The king, being persuaded that the Bishop
of Lisieux can be of more use in the
next assembly than any other of your suffragans,
his majesty has ordered me to
write you that you will please have him
chosen," etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>From page 115 to 153 M. Gérin
demonstrates this pressure unanswerably;
and from page 153 to page 261,
he shows from the character of the
persons chosen, the nature of the
assembly, and its obsequiousness to
the sovereign. On page 260 he asks,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Why were not seen there Mascaron,
Fléchier, Bourdaloue, Fénélon, Huet, Mabillon,
Thomassin, Rancé, Tronson, Brisacier,
Tiberge, La Salle, La Chétardie, and
so many others, still more glorious in the
sight of God than in that of men?...
Cease then from saying that the assembly
of 1682 was the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élite</i> of the clergy of the
day!"</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the most interesting features
connected with the history of the assembly
is the new phase put upon the
part acted in it by the famous Bishop
of Meaux&mdash;Bossuet. His position
here contradicts what we have seen
him do in the year 1663. But from
all the documents M. Gérin brings
forward, it is evident that he was
drawn in against his will. In one
place he writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The assembly is about to be held; and
they desire not only that I should be present,
but that I should preach the introductory
sermon." (Letter to the Abbé de
Rancé.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Fleury in his notes says,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It was the will of the king that the Bishop
of Meaux should be present."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is true that the articles were
drawn up by him; but it was because
he saw that extreme opinions were
about to prevail, to prevent which he
took the propositions into his hands,
and did the best he could under the
circumstances. This, however, does
not excuse him entirely; for there are
times in which we should be ready
to suffer for the cause of truth, and
if necessary even to give our lives.
The fault of Bossuet was, that he was
weak, and could not resolve to forfeit
royal favor for the glory of suffering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
in a just cause. After a careful and
thorough perusal of the chapter on
Bossuet and the assembly, it is impossible
to come to any milder conclusion
than this. The articles were
drawn up and passed by the assembly.
It is not our purpose to go into
an examination of these articles.
It will suffice to state that their aim
was to limit that fulness of power
belonging to the sovereign pontiff
which we have seen implied in the
definition of the Council of Florence,
without seeming to do or say any
thing that could be noted as heretical
or schismatical; and in the third
article there is an indorsement of
the decrees of the fourth and fifth
Council of Constance, which it is
well known were never approved by
the sovereign pontiff, and have therefore
no authority. These decrees
proclaim the superiority of a general
council of bishops over the pope,
and strike a direct blow at his infallibility
and supremacy. They were
the very decrees that caused the decision
of the Council of Florence,
though the occasion of the definition
was the union of the Greek and Latin
churches. How were these articles
received? On the 19th of March
they were adopted by the assembly.
On the 11th of April, Innocent XI.
censured them in his brief. Louis
XIV. was so much impressed by this
act of the pope that he prevented
the bishops of the assembly from
sending a circular to the prelates of
the kingdom, by way of protest. On
the 9th of May, he suspended the
sessions of the assembly; and on the
29th of June, he sent orders for its immediate
dissolution, without allowing
it to go through with the rest of its
programme. Count de Maistre says
of him, "He broke up the assembly
unceremoniously, with so much wisdom
and fitness, that one almost pardons
him for having called it together."<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
He did not even allow the
minutes of the sessions to be put in
the archives of the clergy.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
M. Gérin
tells us that the people were opposed
to this assembly from the outset; and
when the members were about to depart,
the following epigram sped them
on their way,</p>

<div class="cpoem" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Prélats, abbés, séparez-vous;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laissez un peu Rome et l'Eglise!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Un chacun se moque de vous,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Et toute la cour vous méprise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ma foi! l'on vous ferait, avant qu'il fût un an,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Signer à l'Alcoran."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The ministers of the king were
very much irritated; they dared not
then, as they did in 1688, appeal to
a general council, because this would
bring upon them the censures of the
bull <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Execrabilis</i> of Pius II. It was
determined, therefore, by the king to
permit the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">procureur-général</i> to make
a protest privately, in the hands of
the <i>greffier</i> or keeper of the archives
of the parliament, without the knowledge
even of the first president. In
the mean while the clergy, far from
acquiescing in the decrees of a body
which had falsely assumed to represent
them, were giving evidence in a
marked manner of their disapprobation.
Like all those who try to compromise
between right and wrong,
between the service of God and the
good-will of the world, the framers of
the four articles had become unacceptable
to both.</p>

<p class="center">
"A Dio Spiacenti ed ai nemici sui."<br />
</p>

<p>The parliament protested because
the prelates had not gone far enough;
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">procureur-général</i>, De Harlay, put
in a formal declaration on this subject,
and it was registered by permission
of the king. But these men
were not the clergy, not the people.
M. Gérin gives us witnesses who testify
to what these thought and said.
The first is one above suspicion, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
man favorable to the court, the Abbé
Le Gendre; he says,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"At first the declaration of the clergy
was by no means applauded. Far from
doing so, many attributed it to cowardice,
saying that it was the effect of the servile
obedience of the bishops to the will of the
court. Others thought it was neither prudent
nor honorable to rise with levity
against the pretensions of the pope, at a
moment when he was risking every thing to
sustain theirs. This movement of opposition,
which was almost general, gave birth
to spicy writing, in which Mgr. De Harlay
was the most ill-used, as he was regarded
as the first inciter, and almost as the only
author of all that was done in the assembly."</p></blockquote>

<p>The edict of the 30th of March
ordered that the four articles should
be registered in all the universities,
and be taught by all the professors.
If this doctrine, remarks M. Gérin,
had been but generally received, it
would have been hailed with rejoicing.
What happened? It was opposed
by the most numerous, the most
learned, and the most pious portion
of the clergy. The faculty of Paris
was composed of seven hundred and
fifty-three members, as appears from
the <span class="smcap">MSS.</span> Colbert, Mél. t. vii. Of these,
one hundred and sixty-nine belonged
to the Sorbonne. The "<i>Plan for
Reforming the Faculty</i>," in 1683,
(Pap. Harlay,) says,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The house of Sorbonne, with the exception
of six or seven, have been educated
in sentiments contrary to the declaration.
The professors, the syndic excepted, are so
opposed to it that those even who are paid
by the king have not been willing to teach
any of the propositions presented to his majesty
in 1663, etc.... The principal
of the College of Plessis, and those whom
he employs and protects, in his college and
out of it, are absolutely one with those of
Sorbonne."</p></blockquote>

<p>As to the College of Navarre, the
<span class="smcap">MSS.</span> Colbert, t. 155, tell us that its
principal, Professor Guyard, was entirely
devoted to Rome, etc., and
others prominent, Saussay, Ligny,
Vinot, were of like opinion. In 1682,
none of the professors except Doctor
Lefèvre taught the maxims of the
kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>Of St. Sulpice, St. Nicolas de Chardonnet,
and the Missions Etrangères,
we read,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Those of St. Sulpice, of St. Nicolas de
Chardonnet, and of the Missions Etrangères,
who have given their opinion in this
affair, (of the four articles,) hold the same
views as those of Sorbonne."</p></blockquote>

<p>Of the religious orders and communities,
it was written in 1663,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Nothing can be hoped for of the Carmelites,
Augustinians, and Franciscans, who
make profession of favoring his holiness in
every thing," etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>The parliament, therefore, and the
grand council had, by an abuse of
power, decided that <em>each one</em> of the
mendicant orders should have but
<em>two votes</em> in the faculty, so that thirty-four
Franciscans, thirty-eight Dominicans,
thirty-three Augustinians, and
nineteen Carmelites had only eight
votes in the faculty.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Forty-three Cistercians and six canons
regular, who are all for Rome, are to be
treated as the above friars."</p></blockquote>

<p>That, besides being the most numerous,
the opponents of the articles
were the most learned, is evident
from the details we have given; all
the professors of Sorbonne, with the
exception of Pirot, all the professors of
Navarre, except one, Lefèvre, taught
the ultramontane opinions. The <span class="smcap">MSS.</span>
Colbert prove this also beyond the
possibility of doubt.</p>

<p>That the opponents of the declaration
were also men most remarkable
for their piety, is acknowledged by
those who were engaged in giving
information to Colbert.</p>

<p>To show the exactness of the facts
given us here, M. Gérin quotes the
words of a famous anonymous book,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Tradition des Faits</i>, that appeared
in 1760, by the Gallican Abbé Chauvelin,
clerical counsellor to the parliament
of Paris. The abbé writes,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When it was resolved to oblige the ecclesiastics
to profess the maxims of France,
what difficulties stood in the way? It was
necessary to extort from many of them their
consent. Others opposed obstacles which
all the authority of the parliament could
only with difficulty remove. It became necessary
to use all the zeal and light of several
prelates, and of several doctors, who
were favorable to the true teaching, to bring
back the great number of ultramontanes in
the French clergy.... The ecclesiastics
did not cease from resistance until the
parliament used its authority to restrain
them.... The university and the
faculty of law submitted without difficulty,
<i>but they were obliged to proceed by way of authority
to make the faculty of theology obey</i>."</p></blockquote>

<p>The facts given above, the testimony
of witnesses above suspicion,
of those whose interest it would have
been to conceal what they say, the
action of the parliament, and the petty
ways adopted to coerce the professors,
v. g., withholding their pay,<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
all evince that the maxims known as
Gallican were forced upon the clergy
and people of France. But not only
is this the case, but so fully were the
king and the bishops themselves convinced
of their falsity that they retracted
them. Before showing this,
we will add a curious and precious
document from the hands of the wily
Achille de Harlay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">procureur-général</i>,
addressed to Colbert on the 2d
of June, 1682. After saying that the
proposed visit of the parliament to
the faculty would have been unfortunate,
because it would have revealed
to Rome the divergence between the
latter and the government, he goes
on to add that "of the assembly of
the clergy, the greater part would
change to-morrow, and willingly, if
they were allowed to do so."<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>The act of the assembly, as we
have seen, drew from the sovereign
pontiff an authoritative censure. This
was not all; the pope refused the
bulls of consecration for those who
had taken part in it, unless they
made their formal submission to his
decision. The king, who at heart
was a sincere Catholic, opened his
eyes to the danger of the church.
As we have said, he withheld the
minutes of the proceedings in the
first instance, although he allowed a
private protest to be made. Later
he revoked his decree ordering the
doctrine of the four articles to be
taught in the French schools. Page
454 has a letter of Louis to the sovereign
pontiff, in which he informs his
holiness of this, September 14th, 1693.
A posthumous work of Daguesseau<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
says,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This letter of Louis XIV. to Pope Innocent
was the seal put upon the accommodation
between the court of Rome and the
clergy of France; and conformably to the
engagement it contained, his majesty did
not any longer enforce the observation of
the edict of March, 1682, which obliged all
who wished to obtain degrees to sustain the
declaration of the clergy made that year
with regard to ecclesiastical authority; ceasing
thus to impose, on this point, the obligation
existing, while the edict was in force,
and leaving for the future, as before the edict,
full liberty to sustain the doctrine."</p></blockquote>

<p>L'Abbé de Pradt, in his work, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les
Quatre Concordats</i>, speaks of the letter
of Louis XIV., and says that
Pius VII. had it with him&mdash;"an old
scrap of paper," as Napoleon expressed
it&mdash;and wished the emperor
to sign it. This, however, Napoleon
declined to do, until he could consult
his theologians. On their advice
he refused to sign it. He did more.
The abbé says,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When the archives of Rome were
brought to Paris, Napoleon went one day
to the Hôtel de Soubise, in which they were
kept. There he obtained the letter of Louis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
XIV. He took it with him, and, on his return
to the Tuileries, threw it into the fire,
saying, 'We'll not be troubled hereafter
with these ashes.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Montholon tells us in his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoires
pour servir à l'Histoire de France</i>,
that Napoleon dictated to him these
words concerning the book of the
Abbé de Pradt,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'This work is not a libel: if it contains
some erroneous ideas, it contains a great
number which are sound and worthy of
meditation.' He afterward dictated six
notes upon different points contained in the
work; he takes notice in them of all that
appeared to him deserving of censure; but
he has not a single word to say against the
story of the destruction by himself of the
letter of Louis XIV."<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>With regard to the bishops who
had taken part in the declaration,
they had the good sense and virtue
to submit to him whom Christ has
named his vicar and the pastor of
pastors. On the 14th of September,
each one of them wrote to Innocent
XII. in the following terms,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Prostrate at the feet of your holiness,
we profess and declare that we grieve deeply
from our heart, and beyond what we can
express, on account of what has been done
in the assembly, so greatly offensive to your
holiness and your predecessors; and therefore
whatever may have been deemed (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">censeri
potuit</i>) decreed against ecclesiastical
power and pontifical authority, we hold,
and declare that all should hold it, as not
decreed. Moreover, we hold as not determined
on whatever may have been deemed
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">censeri potuit</i>) determined on in prejudice
of the rights of churches; for our intention
was not to decree any thing nor to do any
thing prejudicial to the said churches."</p></blockquote>

<p>The following passages from <span class="smcap">MSS.</span>
and works of the day add confirmation
to this letter.</p>

<p>A memoir on the liberties of the
Gallican Church, composed by order
of "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monseigneur Louis, Dauphin de
France, Duc de Bourgoyne, mort en
1710</span>," says,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This court (Rome) continues always
what it has begun, and often obliges us to
retract or alter what we have judiciously
and necessarily done against her. Nothing
proves this better than the history of the assembly
of 1682."</p></blockquote>

<p>Adrien Baillet, writing his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Démêlé
de Philippe le Bel avec Boniface VIII.</i>,
tells us,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the first variance, (between Philip
and Boniface,) it was the court of Rome
that gave satisfaction to that of France; in
the second, (of the assembly,) it is the court
of France that has just rendered satisfaction
to that of Rome."</p></blockquote>

<p>Bayle, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire</i>, art. "Braunbom,"
writes,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"France was so far from having broken
with the pope, from the year 1690 to the
year 1701, that she became, on the contrary,
more papist. It is known, moreover, that
Innocent XII. gained the day, in having
things put again on their old footing in 1693."</p></blockquote>

<p>We have tried to give the substance
of M. Gérin's work. We feel
that we have given but a meagre
idea of it. Still, this much is evident
from what we have written, that the
doctrine known as Gallican was not
the doctrine of the French clergy.
That it afterward became so, in great
part was owing undoubtedly to the
influence of the assembly of 1682,
and of those who in high positions
lent their aid to its propagation
among the rising generation of students.
They, early imbued with
these maxims, were far less to blame
than the men who first broached
such principles. Let us hope that
the comparatively few who hold to
these opinions, seeing the origin of
what they profess, will understand
the worthlessness of them, and unite
with the universal church in professing
belief in the infallibility of the
See of Peter.</p>

<h2>PUTNAM'S DEFENCE.</h2>


<p>Our readers will remember, we
presume, that <cite>Putnam's Magazine</cite> for
July last contained an article which
attracted some attention, under the title
of "Our Established Church," and
to which we replied in our number
for the August following; the same
magazine for last month, in an article
entitled "The Unestablished Church,"
comes out with its defence, of which
we should be uncivil not to take some
notice.</p>

<p>The July article, written in an unsuccessful
vein of irony, was directed
against the honor both of the church
and the city and State of New York,
and was designed to show that the
church, grasping at wealth and power,
and skilfully availing herself of
political passions and party divisions,
had obtained from the State and city
governments endowments for herself
and subventions for her educational
and charitable institutions out of all
proportion to any granted to similar
Protestant institutions. We replied
that the endowments are imaginary,
for the church here is unendowed;
that the subventions are greatly exaggerated;
that several alleged had
never been made, while others said
to have been made to Catholic were
in fact made to Protestant institutions;
and that Catholics had never
received a tithe of what was requisite
to place them on an equality in
regard to subventions from the public
with non-Catholics. The <cite>Magazine</cite>,
though with exceeding ill grace, concedes
nearly all that we denied, abandons
its assumption that ours is the
established church, confesses that it
is unestablished, and disputes us, except
with sneers and exclamation-points,
only in regard to two statements
in our reply, one of which is of no
importance, and the other is one in
which it is decidedly, not to say maliciously
wrong.</p>

<p>The two points disputed we proceed
to dispose of. The <cite>Magazine</cite>
charged the corporation of the city
with granting leases of valuable sites
for Catholic institutions for a long term
of years at a merely nominal rent.
We replied that only one such
lease had been granted since 1847,
which is not technically exact, and
we overlooked the fact that the lease
for the site of the Catholic Orphan
Asylum between Fifty-first and Fifty-second
streets bears the date of 1857;
but by the <cite>Magazine's</cite> own showing,
though technically a new lease, and
so recorded, it was really only a
change in the tenure of the old lease.
Catholics had held and occupied the
site under a lease from the city, and
at the same rent as now, for years
before 1847. So much for the first
point.</p>

<p>The <cite>Magazine</cite> charged that the
State paid out, in 1866, for benefactions
under religious control $129,025.14,
of which $124,174.14 went
to the religious purposes of the Catholic
Church. Not being able to
find any proof of this, and regarding
the unsupported statement of the
writer as presumptive evidence of
falsehood rather than of truth, we
let the charge pass without any attempt
at a specific refutation. The
<cite>Magazine</cite> reiterates the statement, and
refers to the report of the comptroller
of the State. We have the comptroller's
report before us; we have
examined and reëxamined it; but we
do not find the statement in it or
any thing to warrant it; and it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
been more than once pronounced on
the highest authority, and proved to
be a forgery, as the <cite>Magazine</cite> well
knows or is inexcusable for not knowing.</p>

<p>We did not meet this statement for
the first time in <cite>Putnam's Magazine</cite>.
It had been previously made, and
we supposed sufficiently refuted in
the journals, especially in the <cite>Utica
Herald</cite>, whose editor, Mr. Roberts,
had been a member of the Legislature
and of the committee of ways
and means in 1866. Mr. Roberts
under his own name, pronounced it
a forgery. For honest and fair-minded
men this was conclusive. But
the charge was embodied in an anonymous
memorial, and laid on the
desks of the members of the New
York State Convention, held in 1867
and 1868, and was again pronounced
in open debate a forgery, without a
single voice being raised in its defence.
The Hon. Mr. Cassidy, of
the Albany <cite>Atlas and Argus</cite>, declared
it false from beginning to end.
The Hon. Mr. Alvord, the distinguished
member from Onondaga
County, did the same. The Hon.
Erastus Brooks, member of the Convention
from Richmond, and one of
the editors of the New York <cite>Evening
Express</cite>, would not go quite so far,
but regarded it as an admirable example
of one of the many ways of
telling a lie. He exposed its disingenuous
character, by showing that
the $8000 stated in it to be appropriated
to St. Mary's Hospital, Rochester,
was expressly declared in the
statute making the appropriation to
be for the support of soldiers under
the supervision of Dr. Backus, the
surgeon of the post. The soldiers
were supported and taken care of
in St. Mary's Hospital, as the only
proper place, in the judgment of the
military authorities, that could be obtained.
Mr. Brooks also gave, as
another instance of the disingenuousness
of the statement, its omission
to count $25,000, appropriated to a
Protestant institution in Elmira, we
suppose for a similar purpose. Mr.
Alvord not only pronounced it false
from beginning to end, but, statute
in hand, showed from the act of the
Legislature itself, which he read, that
instead of appropriating for charitable
purposes nearly $130,000, it appropriated
only $80,000, to be divided
among the several counties according
to their assessed valuation.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
What has become of our friend, the
Rev. Leonard W. Bacon, who sometimes
writes for <cite>Putnam</cite>, and who has
such delicate scruples about Protestants
using forged documents against
Catholics?</p>

<p>So much has been said about the
partiality of the Legislature to the
Catholic Church that it may be well
to look at the conditions on which it
grants and distributes its aid to charitable
institutions. The act of 1866,
so bitterly denounced, appropriates
from the State treasury $80,000 for
orphan asylums, to be apportioned
to the several counties according to
their assessed value, and distributed
to the several asylums according to
the number of inmates received and
cared for in them respectively, without
the slightest reference to the fact
whether they were Catholic or Protestant.
Nothing could be fairer, and
if Catholic asylums received more
of the benefaction than those under
the charge of non-Catholics, it was
simply because they received and
cared for a larger number of orphans.
We see no ground of complaint here
against either the Legislature or the
church. It is very possible that Catholics
have a larger number of orphans
in proportion to their population
than have non-Catholics, and it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
is not unlikely, also, that they are
more ready to make sacrifices for
their support.</p>

<p>In the list of benefactions of the
State to Catholic institutions in 1866,
the <cite>Magazine</cite> places the item of $78,000
to the Catholic Protectory. This
was a special grant to enable the
society to purchase a site and erect
suitable buildings for its purpose.
This protectory corresponds very
nearly to the Protestant societies for
the protection and reformation of
juvenile delinquents, and which the
State is accustomed to aid by its benefactions.
The appropriations for its
support are justified on the ground
that it is of great public utility and
protection of the public from a class
of destitute children not unlikely, if
not taken care of, to grow up vicious
and criminal, to fill our alms-houses,
our jails and penitentiaries. The
community at large, rather than the
church specially, is benefited, and there
is no good reason why grants for its
support should be objected to or regarded
as made for special Catholic
purposes. The only thing that a Protestant
can object to, if any charitable
institution is to receive aid from
the State, is, that by aiding a Catholic
protectorate to take care of and reform
destitute children of Catholics
without the loss of their Catholic
faith, it so far fails to aid Protestants
to bring them up in Protestantism, or,
what is perhaps worse, in no religion.</p>

<p>As a matter of course, <cite>Putnam's
Magazine</cite> dwells on the public grants
to certain Catholic schools in this
city. We do not deny those grants.
We conceded and defended them in
our former article, and the <cite>Magazine</cite>
has in no respect invalidated
our defence; it has only stared and
sneered at it. Give us either schools
to which we can send our children,
or divide the schools equitably between
Catholics and Protestants, and
we will solicit no special grants of the
sort. As it is, neither the city nor
the State gives back by way of subvention
to our schools more than a
pittance of what it takes from us
for the support of schools to which
we cannot with our Catholic conscience
send our children. If the
State taxes the whole community
alike for the support of public schools,
it is bound to provide schools for
Catholics as well as Protestants, and
for both such as leave the conscience
of each free, sacred, and inviolable.
If it refuses to do so, the least that it
can do is to make liberal grants to
the schools Catholics are obliged to
establish for themselves.</p>

<p>What we have thus far said disposes
of the <cite>Magazine's</cite> statistics, and
sufficiently relieves the State from the
charge of discriminating in favor of
Catholics, as well as the church from
the charge of intriguing for special
favors. She has never asked or received
any special favors from the Legislature.
The other matters in the
article merit no special reply. The
writer attempts to be witty, but succeeds
only in being abusive. Wit
does not appear to be his strong
point, and his attempts at it only
provoke a smile at his expense. His
strong point is hatred of the church.
He hates her with a hatred equal to
that of the wicked Jews for our Lord
whom they crucified between two
thieves. Her very presence annoys
him; her independence enrages him;
and nothing appears able to appease
him but her subjection to the state,
and the subjection of the state to the
intolerant Protestantism of which he
is a mouth-piece.</p>

<p>The <cite>Magazine</cite> is hard to please. It
condemned, in July last, the church
as our established church; we made
answer that she neither is nor wishes
to be the established church. It
now, in December, condemns her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
no less as the unestablished church.
It blames us both for opposing and
for not opposing the common
schools, for agreeing and for not
agreeing with our own church, and
for opposing and for not opposing
religious liberty. Both the church,
and we, personally, must be wrong
anyhow. If its specific charges
against her are false, then the contrary
must be true and equally charges
against her. If she is not the synagogue
of Satan, she is the church of
God, which is just as bad. Nothing
can disconcert it or prove it in the
wrong, since it sees no inconsistency
in urging charges that refute each
other. Yet it represents and speaks
for the <em>enlightened</em> portion of mankind!</p>

<p>The <cite>Magazine</cite> labors at length to
prove that the church opposes, and
quotes the <cite>Syllabus</cite> to prove that she
must oppose, the common school
system as it is; and yet sees in this
fact no reason why Catholics cannot,
with a good conscience, send their
children to them. We are opposed
to the common schools as they are,
because our church condemns them;
that is, because founded on what we
hold to be a false principle, and hostile
alike to religion and society; but
if Protestants want them for themselves,
they can have them; for the
church legislates only for Catholics,
not for non-Catholics who reject her
authority. Hence, we oppose the system
as a system for Catholics, not
as a system intended for Protestants.
We do not approve the system even
for them, any more than we do their
heresy and schism, which we account
"deadly sins;" but if they insist on
having godless schools for their children,
they can have them; we cannot
hinder them. The system might be
modified so that we could accept it;
but it depends on them so to modify
it or not, for they have the power.</p>

<p>The <cite>Magazine</cite> withdraws its false
statement as to the millions of property
held in fee-simple by the five
bishops in the State, but blames the
law of 1863, which incorporates the
church in the several New York dioceses,
as securing to her advantages
of which the non-Catholic religious
denominations are deprived. This is
a mistake. It only secures to her
the rights secured to these under the
general law for creating, continuing,
and reviving religious societies and
parishes, and which are not secured
to her under that general law. That
law proceeds on the assumption that
in ecclesiastical organizations the parish
is the unit, which is not true with
regard to the church. With us the
unit is the diocese, and the bishop,
not the parochus, is, strictly speaking,
the pastor. To proceed on the contrary
supposition would be to interfere
with the internal constitution
and discipline of the church, and to
deprive her of that control over her
own temporalities which is possessed
by every Protestant denomination in
the State. The law objected to only
secures to the church equal rights
with the sects&mdash;only it does it by another
method made necessary by the
fact that the diocese, not the parish,
in her constitution, is the unit. The
law only places the church on a footing
of equality, before the state, with
the Protestant sects, and no friend
of religious liberty can reasonably
object to it. It secures the public
against abuses, the application of the
property held to church purposes,
and the church the free management
of her own temporalities.</p>

<p>The <cite>Magazine</cite> complains that the
law is no longer equal, because it is
not the same for all religious denominations.
Has it never occurred to it
that one and the same law for all
would operate unequally, for all have
not the same internal constitution?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
The law very proper and just for
Presbyterians, whose organic unit is
the parish, could in no manner secure
the same rights to the church, whose
organic unit is the diocese. Here is
precisely where Protestants usually
err in their legislation, and violate the
equal rights they profess to approve.
They overlook the fact that the same
law can bear equally only on denominations
that are organized after one
and the same model, and that for the
state to set up a model, and outlaw
all denominations that do not, or in
so far as they do not conform to it, is
a violation of religious liberty and of
equal rights. It is practically to establish
one form of church organization
and deny its protection to all
churches that do not see proper to
adopt it. Religious liberty requires
that each denomination be left free,
so far as the civil power is concerned,
to adopt such form of church organization
in relation to its own temporalities
as well as spirituals as it
chooses; and the equal rights of all
require the state to respect and protect
each in the full possession and
enjoyment of its own particular form
of organization. The law must not
be simply the same for the Catholic
and the Congregationalist, but
must be so framed as to give each the
same rights; to the church, with her
constitution and discipline, all the
freedom and protection that it does
to the Congregationalist, with his
congregational organization and discipline.
This is what the law of this
State enacted in 1863 attempts to secure,
and partially, if not wholly, succeeds
in doing. The Protestant, that
is, the rabid Protestant, objects to
that law, not because it discriminates
in favor of Catholicity, but because it
gives to the church the same legal
protection that it does to non-Catholic
churches, and does not discriminate
in favor of Protestantism as all
previous legislation on the subject had
done, at least in its practical operation.</p>

<p>We are accused, because we say
the church here desires no establishment
by law&mdash;for she has what is better
than such establishment&mdash;of contradicting
the <cite>Syllabus</cite>, and going
against the supreme pontiff. We accept
the <cite>Syllabus</cite> without the slightest
reserve, though probably not the
<cite>Magazine's</cite> sense. The <cite>Syllabus</cite> condemns
those who demand the separation
of church and state in the sense
of the European liberals; but not us
for not requiring the church to be established
by law as the state church.
Those liberals mean by the separation
of church and state the independence
of the state, and its right to
pursue its own policy irrespective
of the rights and interests of religion.
In that sense we also condemn the
separation, and are continually warring
against it as political atheism.
But we deny that in that sense, or in
the sense of the <cite>Syllabus</cite>, we do or
ever have advocated the separation
of church and state. That separation
does not and ought not to exist
in this country. This is not an infidel,
a godless country, though it may
be fast becoming so; and Christianity
is, as it should be, the supreme
law of the land, as it is part and parcel
of the Common Law. An act of
the Legislature of the State or the nation
forbidding Christianity or authorizing
acts directly against it would be
null and void from the beginning,
and be treated by the courts as would
be a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus muncipium</i> in violation of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus gentium</i>.</p>

<p>The rights of Christianity are by
our civil institutions recognized as
paramount to all others. They are
called by us the rights of man, rights
which are held not from the state,
but immediately from the Creator,
and therefore are more properly called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
the rights of God than the rights
of man. These rights limit the rights
and authority of the state; for it is
bound to respect them as sacred and
inviolable, and to protect and defend
them for each and every person within
its jurisdiction to the full extent
of its power. Among these rights is
the right of conscience, which, in fact,
is the chief, the very basis of all our so-called
natural and inalienable rights.
My right of conscience is the law
for the state, and prohibits it from
enacting any thing that violates it.
My conscience is my church, the Catholic
Church; and any restriction of
her freedom, or any act in violation
of her rights, violates or abridges my
right or freedom of conscience, which,
where equal rights are recognized, the
state has no right to do in my case
any more than in that of any other.</p>

<p>My church, the Catholic Church,
is, by virtue of my citizenship and
my right of conscience, the law of the
state so far as her own freedom is
concerned, and as is necessary to
protect and defend her in the free
and full enjoyment of her rights.
The church is free in and to the full
extent of my freedom of conscience;
and though I have no right to impose
my conscience on another, I have
the right to protest against any and
every act of the state that is repugnant
to it or contrary to my church.
The state is just as much bound to
respect, protect, and defend the Catholic
Church in her faith, her constitution,
her discipline, and her worship,
as if she were the only religious
body in the nation. Other religious
bodies exist and have, not before
God, but before civil society, equal
rights with her; and if the state can
do nothing to violate their rights of
conscience, it can do nothing to violate
hers, as it in fact does in its legislation
in regard to marriage and
divorce, both here and in nearly
all European states and empires.
It cannot violate the Catholic conscience
in order to conform to the
Protestant conscience.</p>

<p>Here is the way in which we understand
the separation of church and
state, as it exists in this country, and we
feel quite sure that we do not incur
the censure of the <cite>Syllabus</cite>. We have
here done nothing but set forth in its
true light the religious liberty recognized
by our American system of government,
and which forms the basis
of our civil liberty. Our church
is here with all her freedom, in all
her integrity, by right, not merely
tolerated; and by a right which is not
a civil grant and revocable at will,
but by the irrevocable grant of God.
Her full and entire freedom is recognized
by the fundamental principle
of the American state, and we demand
that the civil law respect and
protect her freedom against all gainsayers.
So much we demand on the
ground of equal rights and in the
name of inviolable conscience. When
we go farther and ask more from the
state than equality with the sects, we
give <cite>Putnam's Magazine</cite> full liberty to
denounce us, and to condemn us as
the enemies of religious liberty.</p>

<h2>A POLISH PATRIOTIC HYMN.</h2>


<p>In an obscure corner of the Mazarine
Library, at Paris, was lately discovered
by its director or librarian in
chief, Mr. Philarète Chasles, a small
black prayer-book; an oblong duodecimo,
gilt-edged, although printed
on poor gray paper. It was in the
Polish tongue, with the exception of
the vesper-hymns and some canticles
of the church in Latin. No catalogue
chronicled its existence, and it
was, evidently, a despised waif, rejected
as of too little importance to be
entitled to a place in the dignified
alcoves.</p>

<p>On examination, it was found to
contain the following original Latin
ode&mdash;a remarkable composition in
many respects, touchingly beautiful
in a simplicity at once tender and
vigorous, and an exquisite combination
of piety and patriotism.</p>

<p>It was doubtless sung in the
churches of Poland about the year
1740, when Europe stood aloof in
silent ingratitude to those who, following
Sobieski's sword, had saved
her from the Turk; when England
was of course indifferent to the fate
of a Catholic nation; when France
was without sympathy for the faithful,
and her kings proved then, more
than ever, that Catholicity would
have been better off without their
aid; when Catharine of Russia gilded
her cupidity with philosophical maxims,
and Frederick of Prussia, called
the Great, calumniated those he robbed.</p>

<p>As we read the hymn, we can well
imagine the crowd in front of the
altar, covered with flowers, in some
rude, white-walled village church.
They kneel before the infant Jesus in
his mother's arms. Peasants in their
national costume&mdash;a long, white
blouse reaching to the knee, the
curved sabre in the belt&mdash;children,
soldiers, women, young girls. They
chant one of those peculiarly wild
Slavonic rhythms in <sup>6</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>
or <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>. There,
prostrate, with clasped hands, their
weeping eyes on the infant Saviour,
the child Liberator, they intone these
beautiful Latin strophes, a rare specimen
of spontaneous and popular
poetry:</p>

<p class="center">AD PARVULUM CHRISTUM CONTRA
HOSTES PATRIÆ.<br /><br />

1.</p>

<div class="cpoem" lang="la" xml:lang="la"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Qui perfidum Turcam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Compellis ad furcam!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Patriam! patriam! patriam<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Defende!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<blockquote>

<p>Mercifully listen to those who praise and
implore thee, O tender Infant! Defend our
country. Thou alone art the Lamb, alone
powerful! alone great! Exterminator of
the treacherous Turk. Our country, our
country, ah! defend our country.</p></blockquote>

<p>Barbarous and artificial strophes,
perhaps you think? Yes, measured
by Lucretius and Virgil, they may be;
poor, thin, leonine verses like those of
the twelfth century Benedictine monk
who wrote,</p>

<p class="center">
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gloria factorum temere conceditur horum</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>singing verses without prosodial measure,
their vehement and rapid rhyme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
answering for every thing. And yet
this learned barbarism, borrowed from
the seventh century, from a poetry in
ruins, gives life to the ardent flame
and the tragic sorrow it expresses. It
is a deep cry of anguish from the innermost
depths of a stricken people's
heart.</p>

<p>We hear the divine and child-like
victim invoked in his feebleness by a
vanquished nation, and appealed to
in his shivering nakedness (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">et friges et
taces</i>) by the oppressed in tears, and
these cries form a sad though sublime
harmony. The unknown ecclesiastical
minstrel&mdash;for the poetry is anonymous&mdash;continues:</p>

<p class="center">2.</p>

<blockquote>

<h2>THROUGH DEVIOUS WAYS.</h2>


<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p>I was given to psychological studies
in those days; was fond of attributing
vagaries of disposition and
eccentricities of temper to inherited
perversions, insurmountable in themselves,
and consequently the misfortunes&mdash;not
faults&mdash;of their possessors.
At that time I firmly believed
in the mysterious attraction of soul to
soul; in the mutual recognition of
kindred spirits, and their sympathy
with each other from behind the barriers
of flesh and blood. I do not
say I have quite abandoned the opinion
now; but there is a reservation.</p>

<p>I had dipped a little into German
mysticism; had sifted, as I thought,
all creeds to the bottom&mdash;all save
one. For Catholicity and its "superstitions"
I had always entertained
too profound a contempt to seek to
acquire a further knowledge of its doctrines
than any intelligent American
can learn from the well-read (?) theologians
who form its antipodes, and
who launch forth anathemas against
Rome on high-days and holidays
when other subjects weary or grow
flat. I flattered myself that my acquaintance
with this particular form
of idolatry was quite thorough for all
practical purposes; the contamination
extended no further; and yet I believe
my case would represent that of nine
tenths of the thinking, intelligent Protestants
of this peculiarly-favored and
grace-illumined country.</p>

<p>It was&mdash;for me&mdash;the first party of
the season. January had almost
danced itself away, and the fashionables
were beginning to anticipate
Lent; but until to-night I had persistently
refused all invitations from
friends and acquaintances. Of the
former I had very few; I had grown
tired of the world, of pleasure-seeking,
of myself. What wonder, when,
in the great city of New York, with
its hundreds of thousands of throbbing
hearts, there was not one to
whom in solemn truth I could hold
out the right hand of friendship; not
one upon whose sympathies I could
anchor, should the tide of fortune turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
and leave me, a rich man to-day, the
sport of her cruel waves to-morrow?</p>

<p>I prided myself on being cynical,
turning out of the way of all stepping-stones
that might have led to a
happier existence; there was little
faith in human nature in my heart, no
religion in my soul.</p>

<p>Dissatisfied with my own aimless
life, I sought no mirror in the lives
of others; self-sufficient and cold, I
avoided kindness and sympathetic associations.
I was just at that point
when satiety and disgust render the
world and its attributes almost unendurable.</p>

<p>On the evening before mentioned,
I had been introduced to young ladies
by the dozen; had mentally criticised,
weighed, and found wanting each
one upon whom I had inflicted the
bane of my company through a
dance. Tired and ill-humored, I was
about going forward to take leave of
the hostess, when a few words spoken
just behind me made me pause and
look around, curious to know who
the "sweet singer" might be.</p>

<p>It was a woman's voice, clear and
sweet, and the words were, "No,
thank you; I never dance the round
dances."</p>

<p>But a surging crowd of feverish
waltzers drifted by me at the moment,
as the delirious strains of
Strauss's <i>Zamora</i> floated up from the
balcony, and the face I would have
scanned was lost amid the throng.</p>

<p>As I moved off a little from the
dancers, and watched cheeks flush and
bright eyes grow brighter at the call
of voluptuous music, I could not but
wonder at the inconsistency of fate
and fortune that had brought into
this ultra-fashionable gathering a lady,
certainly young, and probably beautiful,
who "did not dance the round
dances."</p>

<p>I passed into the adjoining room.
Several of the waltzers, tired and
heated, had left the crowded <i>salon</i>
before me; here and there a stray
wall-flower tried to look unconscious
and happy in the midst of desolation;
but my eye psychological wandered
in vain up and down, seeking a face
that would seem to indicate the owner
of the voice heard a few moments
before. At length a very young girl
issued from a group that had been
standing near an open window, and,
as I marked the expression of her
faultless mouth and soft blue eyes, I
said to myself, "That is the one." But
at the moment a gay young West-Pointer
stepped forward to meet her,
and in another instant my Madonna
was whirling through the giddy maze.</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" I ejaculated half aloud,
disappointed to find my intuitiveness
at fault, and turned as I did so to encounter
an old friend, not seen for
some time, who entered from the conservatory
in company with a lady.</p>

<p>Surprise and pleasure caused us
momentarily to forget politeness, so
that several sentences were interchanged
before Armitage recollected
himself, and said, "Allow me, Helen.
My friend, Mr. Moray, Miss Foster."
I muttered something&mdash;the young
lady bowed; that was all. The couple
passed on; and I am bound to
confess that I did not notice the
color of the lady's eyes or hair, and
never once thought of her expression,
psychologist as I was.</p>

<p>I recognized no kinship of feeling
or sympathy as we stood within the
circle of each other's magnetism; and
yet my "destiny" had come to me,
and the soul within me, that was to
have risen and grown conscious at
the approach, stood mute and made
no sign.</p>

<p>After that, Fred Armitage called at
my rooms several times, and succeeded
in winning me away from my exclusiveness,
in so much that I promised
to be at his disposal for New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
Year's day, on condition that his
visits of congratulation would be few
and well chosen. He laughed at my
conceit, as he was pleased to call it.
"I don't fancy every body any more
than you do, Ed," he said; "but one
must make allowances and be sociable
with the world. There's a difference
between friends and acquaintances.
One need not have the former
if one doesn't wish; but the latter
are indispensable, unless you give up
the amenities of civilization at once."
After which remark we sallied forth.</p>

<p>Toward evening, and when I had
vowed for the fourth time that each
successive call would be my last,
Fred paused before a handsome house
on Fifth Avenue.</p>

<p>"I am not going in," I said, almost
savagely, as he announced his intention
of entering.</p>

<p>"Only here," he answered, "and I
promise I'll go home with you. I
must call. I should have made this
one first; but I wanted to save the
best morsel for the last. Come; Helen
would never forgive me if I neglected
her to-day."</p>

<p>"And what claim has the young
lady on your time and affections?"
I asked, somewhat more quietly than
before, "you are not in love, or engaged,
or any thing of that kind?"</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ni l'un ni l'autre</i>; it is my cousin,
Helen Foster. I introduced you at
Mrs. Parry's."</p>

<p>I had not time to say more; for the
door opened at this juncture, and we
were ushered into a large and elegantly
furnished parlor, where sat two
ladies&mdash;one old, and very charming
in her old age; the other young and
beautiful. Not lovely; there was nothing
airy or fragile about her; but
radiant, with a fresh, bright color in
her cheeks that made one think of
long walks taken on wintry mornings;
with large brown eyes, which, while
they did not fall or fear as they looked
into yours, yet had a shade of reticence,
almost bashfulness, in their untroubled
depths; with a wealth of
rippling hair, golden brown, crowning
the well-poised head and defining the
delicate ear; with a hand that felt
warm, soft, and friendly, as mine
closed over it.</p>

<p>"We have met before, I believe,"
she said, as Armitage repeated my
name; then, turning to the other lady,
"Mr. Moray, grandmamma, a friend
of Fred's." And the dear little figure
in the arm-chair rose and greeted me
most kindly.</p>

<p>"Has there been no one here to-day,
Helen?" asked Fred; "you look
as though you were quite fresh, and not
at all fatigued from the exchange of
compliments, hand-shaking, etc."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, there have been some
few," she said. "But grandmamma
lives entirely at home, and you know
I patronize society but seldom; consequently,
we have been spared the
dear five hundred particular friends,
and flatter ourselves we feel quite as
comfortable, notwithstanding. Isn't it
so, grandmamma?" And she placed
her hand affectionately on the old lady's
arm. As the tones of her clear, well-modulated
voice reached my ear, a
vision of lights and flowers and flying
feet rose before me, and I almost
heard the bewildering waltz-music
float through the air. And then, lifting
my eyes to the face of the lady
before me, I recognized my <i>rara avis</i>
of that evening&mdash;the girl of the period
who did not dance round dances.</p>

<p>To say that I was not interested
in her from the first, would be to say
an untruth. Her personality affected
me pleasantly, and somewhat strangely.
There was a freshness and elasticity
about her that did not proceed from
inexperience or unacquaintance with
the world; for dignity and self-possession
characterized her every movement,
and yet she seemed entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
unconscious of any claim to originality
or naturalness; because she <em>was</em>
so natural. Our call, that was to
have been so short, lengthened itself
into an hour. Fred and his cousin
made themselves mutually agreeable.
I addressed myself to the elder lady,
now and then exchanging a few words
with the others.</p>

<p>When Fred arose to take leave, I
felt no disposition to join him, and
very unaccountably and inconsistently
reproached him in my own mind
for being in a hurry.</p>

<p>For the first time in many months
I had felt sociably disposed, and had
endeavored to make myself agreeable;
and I was reluctant to leave
that quiet, home-like parlor and its
occupants, both so different from the
brilliant, giddy butterflies within the
flutter of whose wings I had been
vacillating all that day. As we passed
out into the still, cold night, I
looked up at the quiet stars with a
kindly feeling. Fred talked in an
unbroken stream until we reached my
rooms. Arrived there, we spent the
rest of the evening smoking and chatting.
I expressed myself pleased with
his cousin and her grandmother,
whose only grandchild and sole heiress
he informed me she was. The
clock struck twelve as he rose to go.
After I had come back to the fire, I
remember the wholly strange, almost
sorrowful feeling that possessed me.
Gazing into the dying embers, I
dreamed a half-waking dream, wherein
the ghosts of other New Years dead
and gone took form and shape, and
with shadowy, reproachful gestures,
seemed to beckon me away, back
through old scenes and hopes and
yearnings&mdash;faded&mdash;buried&mdash;vanished
all for ever.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p>One afternoon in early spring, I
happened to pass the cathedral just
as service was over. I had spent the
previous evening with Miss Foster&mdash;an
event of not unusual occurrence
now, although I never called unless
when accompanied by Armitage. The
current of my thoughts flowed pleasantly
as the crowd of devout worshippers
issued forth from their devotions.
A lady passed out of the gate,
and I immediately recognized the
figure as that of Miss Foster. "Eccentric,
certainly," I thought; "just
like what I would imagine she might
do. Strange that some of our most
intelligent and highly educated women
can fancy this attending Catholic
churches."</p>

<p>I quickened my steps, and in a moment
was at her side.</p>

<p>"Have you been at vespers, Mr.
Moray?" she asked, as though it were
the most natural thing in the world
that I should have been there.</p>

<p>"Not I," I replied laughingly;
"but you have, I presume?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she rejoined, "grandmamma
will be scolding me, I am afraid.
I went up-stairs to lie down after dinner,
having a slight headache. But
once in my room, I felt as though
a walk would benefit me more, so I
stole out."</p>

<p>"A crowded church is not the best
place in the world in which to get
rid of the headache," I responded.</p>

<p>"Mine has vanished, however," was
the reply. "It had quite disappeared
before I reached the church."</p>

<p>"Do you affect Catholic ceremonies
generally, Miss Foster?" I asked;
"or rather do you admire Catholicism
in the abstract? Or is it the
incense and music and wax tapers
that possess charms for you?"</p>

<p>"All these collectively have attractions
for me," she answered; "but
not in the way you imagine. You
are inclined to believe, no doubt,
that it is some romantic and impressionable
vein in my nature that sends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
me within the influence of Catholic
ceremonies and their accessories. But
we are all liable to error; and you
will not be deeply wounded, I hope,
if I venture to advise you of your
mistake in this instance. I am a Catholic,
and hold all these things as a
part of my faith."</p>

<p>"A Catholic!" I exclaimed in undisguised
astonishment. "A Catholic!
Not a Roman Catholic, Miss
Foster? You mean that you are
one in the true sense of the term?"</p>

<p>"I hope I do&mdash;I think that is what
I mean. I am, by the grace of God,
a Roman Catholic." And it seemed
to me she spoke almost maliciously,
as though deliberately to wound my
dearest prejudices.</p>

<p>"You will the more readily excuse
me for my inability to realize this information,"
I replied, "when I tell
you that until now my acquaintance
with members of your church has
been very limited, and that those
whom I have met have always belonged
to the lowest classes of society.
I find it difficult to convince
myself that you can profess a belief
whose tenets have always appeared
to me to be a web of superstition.
My associates have been altogether
Protestant, and my prejudices, as
you would call them, very decided
wherever Rome was concerned. You
may think me blunt, even impertinent;
but allow me at the same time
to acknowledge that I feel confident
there must be something good and
beautiful in a religion that one of
your intelligence and refinement admires
and professes."</p>

<p>"There is something good and
beautiful in all religions," she answered,
"or they would not be worthy of
the name&mdash;mere attempts and half
promises as most of them are. But
in ours all is goodness and beauty.
I can pardon, even understand your
prejudices; for I shared them once.
I was born and educated in the Presbyterian
faith; a faith hard, cold, and
unconsoling. I can remember the
time when I regarded Catholicity as
but another form of heathenism. For
your estimate of my intelligence and
refinement I can only thank you&mdash;all
the more as you have never had opportunity
to judge correctly of either;
consequently I must take the verdict
for what it is worth. But here I am
at home, and the lamps are lighted.
How late it must be. Thank you
again, and good evening."</p>

<p>With a little rippling laugh she left
my side, and almost before I had time
to answer her parting salutation, she
had tripped up the steps and entered
the house.</p>

<p>A crowd of conflicting thoughts
pursued each other in my mind as I
continued my walk. A consciousness
that I endeavored vainly to ignore
grew stronger as I reflected on what
had passed, and weighed more minutely
all the circumstances of our
meeting and acquaintance. And with
it was mingled a feeling of disappointment,
almost of vexation and pain, as
though I had been touched and assailed
by some detested enemy.</p>

<p>I grew restless; nothing satisfied
me. People said I looked ill. No
wonder, when I sat up half the night
trying to divert my mind from the
study of its own problems, to those
of incomprehensible German philosophy.
I reasoned with what I was
pleased to term my weakness. But
what could I do? I had kept out
of the way of temptation; I had
avoided assemblies where I knew she
was likely to be; twenty times I had
stood upon the threshold of her home,
and as often turned and retraced my
steps. One night I sat alone in my
room, and almost vowed to put the
thought of her from my mind at once
and for ever. As I mused, Armitage
entered unannounced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span></p>

<p>"Desolate and melancholy as ever,"
he said cheerfully, and the sound of
his happy voice made me desperate.
Suddenly, involuntarily, I might say,
I found myself answering him,</p>

<p>"I am tired of being desolate and
melancholy though;" then carelessly,
"What if we saunter down to Miss
Foster's?"</p>

<p>Fred was all willingness, while surprised
at my change of mood. We
walked leisurely along. When we
reached the house, Fred remarked
that the shutters were closed, and
that there was some probability of
the young lady being out. I said
nothing, but made a solemn compact
with myself while we waited. "If she
is not at home," I thought, "that vow
shall be registered and kept; if she is,
<i>che sera sera</i>."</p>

<p>Miss Helen was at home, the servant
said. She reproached me for
not having called in such a length of
time, and wondered if the revelation
made at our last meeting had not
helped to keep me away. Then turning,
to her cousin she said laughingly,
"Mr. Moray was horrified the other
day, to hear of my being a Catholic."</p>

<p>"The other day?" I answered. "It
is fully three months ago, and I have
not yet been able to reconcile my
mind to the fact."</p>

<p>"It is a fact though, Ed," said Armitage;
"and greatly as I deplored the
calamity when it happened four years
ago, I must confess that Helen has
changed for the better in the interval.
You see, she was most irrepressible,
some time since&mdash;before her conversion,
as she calls it&mdash;doing every thing
by fits and starts, and holding every
one under the severest of despotisms;
but I actually believe this little devotion
she has, this habit of confessing,
has toned her down and made her the
rational creature we see her. That's
how you account for the change, isn't
it, coz?"</p>

<p>"Fred, you are unconscionable.
Mr. Moray knows you as well as I
do, no doubt, and weighs your veracity
proportionately. You don't admire
Shelley, Mr. Moray?" interrogatively,
as I turned over the pages
of a richly bound edition of that author
which lay upon a little table near
me.</p>

<p>"No; and yet I do not look at
him from the same point of view as
you probably would. I think he was
crazy. You, I suppose, would pass a
more merciless judgment."</p>

<p>"Let us be charitable," she said,
"and hope that he was insane. But
unhappily his was a species of insanity
of which there are but too many
instances."</p>

<p>After that, the talk fell upon books
generally. The hours slipped by, and
eleven o'clock had struck before we
took leave. Before I left her that
night, I had thrown down the barriers
crumbling so long; I had seen and
recognized a true, womanly woman,
and, all unknown to her, had accepted
what I knew to be the inevitable.</p>

<p>After this I went often to the enchanted
castle. My fairy princess
was nearly always accessible, but so
she was to the rest of the world as
well. How could I hope to be the
favored knight, when her smiles were
bestowed on all so generously? She
was invariably kind and cordial;
sometimes slightly sarcastic and critical,
but never moody or sad. I often
wondered from what source she drew
her abundant cheerfulness, and how
she managed to preserve it.</p>

<p>Never by word or look had I intimated
my own feelings toward her;
something told me to linger at the
gate of paradise, content to see the
roses blooming without daring to venture
in. I felt that a suspicion once
aroused in her mind would change
our relations completely; and I had
not begun to hope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span></p>

<p>As things stood, we grew to be
excellent friends. Our views differed
widely on many points, but religion
was the only really sensitive topic.
More than once I had noticed a look
of pain in her face when I startled
her with some of my materialistic
views, and at last we tacitly avoided
the subject altogether. While I admired
her beautiful simplicity and
faith, I could not understand then, as
I do now, how any aspersion cast
upon that faith could wound her as
deeply as though it sought herself,
and I had never wished to take it
from her. In hopeful moments, few
and far between, when I had dared to
think of her as my wife, the thought
of her religion and the absence of it
in me had, strangely enough, never intruded
itself upon me. Consequently,
it was from no desire to weaken
or alter her convictions in any particular
that I became almost involuntarily
instrumental in bringing matters
to a crisis.</p>

<p>We had been reading French together,
or, to speak more correctly, I
had been reading it to her, one evening
of every week, with the ostensible
purpose of improving my pronunciation
under her tutelage; for she spoke
the language beautifully.</p>

<p>One day an old Parisian who lodged
in the house with me, and who occasionally
made my sitting-room the
theatre of a homily on Victor Hugo,
Sainte-Beuve, and their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">confrères</i>, laid
upon my table a copy of Renan's
"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grand succès</i>."</p>

<p>"Read it," he said; "read it in the
original; it loses by translation."</p>

<p>I promised to do so. That evening
I took it with me to Miss Foster's.
As I walked leisurely along, the
thought struck me that my "teacher"
might probably not admire the "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grand
succès</i>;" but it only lingered a moment,
and troubled me but little.
"No harm in bringing it, any how&mdash;the
style is good," I soliloquized, and
rang the bell in a happier frame of
mind than I had known for weeks.
Fred usually joined us on French
evenings, but to-night another engagement
claimed him. Helen was
sitting alone when I entered the parlor.</p>

<p>"Grandmamma has a headache
this evening, and will not be down,"
she said apologetically.</p>

<p>I sat down, made a few trifling remarks,
to which she responded, and
then arose to bring the book we had
been reading.</p>

<p>"Wait, I have something else to-night,"
I said, taking the volume from
the table where I had placed it.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked, resuming
her seat.</p>

<p>"Renan's book," I replied confidently.
"I thought I would bring it
with me. He has an excellent style&mdash;unique
and polished. He is the
last sensation, you know."</p>

<p>"I will not read it," she said in a
low tone.</p>

<p>"I'll read and you will listen," I
answered. "That is the usual arrangement,
is it not?"</p>

<p>"I will not listen;" she replied, and
I saw by the angry flush mantling
her forehead that I had committed a
grave error; that she misunderstood
my motives and was vexed.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," I said. "We will
not read it, if you so desire; but at
the same time there can be no harm
in informing one's self on opposite
views from our own. This is the spirit
in which I should read the book,
not fearing that it would bias my mind
either one way or the other. Can
you not be as liberal?"</p>

<p>She left her seat and began fingering
in a nervous way the ornaments
that lay upon the mantel.</p>

<p>"I have no wish to hear my God
and my religion railed and blasphemed
at either at first or second hand,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
she said. "It would be none the less
painful coming from the lips of one
whom I had almost learned to call
friend; but who has to-night in a very
few words shown me my mistake.
For my religion I have long been
aware that you cherish an undisguised
contempt; for myself I had hoped
you entertained no contemptuous feeling.
Surely, I have never given you
reason for your action of this evening."</p>

<p>While she was speaking I had
shaped my course. Precipitate as it
might be, there was nothing left me
now but a declaration of my real sentiments,
unless I would forfeit her esteem
for ever. Fully conscious of the
disadvantages of time and circumstance
as I was, and without any
presumption of success, I then and
there resolved to tell her the whole
truth. It was but a hastening to the
end.</p>

<p>"Stop one moment," I replied; "a
word with you. You have wronged
me by intimating that I purposed
aught of disrespect to you or your
religion by what I have unthinkingly
done this evening. I could do neither;
for I love you. How deeply, I, who
have struggled with that love for
months, alone can know; how entirely
and unselfishly, you perhaps might
learn, could you find it in your heart
to let me show you; how vainly, my
own heart tells me while I watch your
face. Surprised you may be&mdash;I have
no doubt you are; displeased too, but
I take no blame to myself for that.
An honest man dares lift his eyes to
a noble woman; and whatever be my
faults, and they are many; wherever
lie my errors, and they are thickly
sown, I still can call myself an honest
man."</p>

<p>She moved further away from where
I stood, and once or twice, while I
was speaking, made a movement as
though to interrupt me. As I uttered
the last words, I saw her eyes flash,
and a half sarcastic smile wreathe itself
about her lips.</p>

<p>"You call yourself an honest man,"
she said; "an honest man! What is
your code, and who the lawgiver?
Is it honest to leave untilled and brier-strewn
the soil that has been given
you in trust for an endless harvest-time;
to waste the talents that have
been bestowed on you with lavish
hand; to spend days and months
and years in pleasant idleness, as you
have done, and as you do? Is it
honest to wrap yourself in a mantle of
false and hollow cynicism, lest your
better nature might have opportunity
to assert its capacities and prove its
possibilities; to scoff at all creeds and
professions of religion as so many
shams and superstitions, because from
the nature of the life you lead your
own ideal must be both hypocrisy and
sham? I am only a woman, and such
men as you place but little confidence
in a woman's judgment and far-sightedness.
But I have read you deeper
than you suppose. Evening after evening,
while you sat here reading, talking
to me, I have been studying you.
I have recognized emotions that your
pride would call weaknesses; thoughts
that your worldly wisdom seeks to
cover with a jest or smile; great capabilities
of sacrifice that your every-day
exterior conceals under <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dilettante</i> tastes
and careless ways. I have seen that
in your eye, heard that in your voice,
which has made me marvel how a soul
like yours could be content with husks
and bitterness. For you, yourself, I
could have sympathy; but I scorn the
evil spirit that is in you."</p>

<p>I had loved her before; but as she
stood there taxing me with that to the
consciousness of which I was but just
awakening, my love gave one great
bound and seemed to sit enthroned
high above sight or sound of human
passion, even while, with every word
she uttered, the knowledge of its vain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
endeavor fastened itself more firmly
upon me. I was about to speak, but
she interrupted me, and the words
came more slowly now, and more
kindly.</p>

<p>"I may have spoken harshly," she
said. "Indeed, I am sure I have. But
it was of yourself with regard to yourself,
and in what I said there was no
thought of my own connection with
the subject. As to that part of it, I can
have none; but I think, however much
or little a woman esteems a man, there
must be something especially tender in
her dealings with one who has made
her the offering of his love. You will
believe me, then, when I say that I
am pained, deeply pained, that you
should have given yours to me, or
deemed its acknowledgment necessary.
Words are idle and superfluous here.
I can and do appreciate it; I can be,
I am your friend. Forgive me if I
have been harsh; in calmer moments
you will come to think of me as one
whose words were quick and too impulsive,
but who had your interest
at heart. Now let me go. Do not
speak further, I beg of you; it would
only pain us both."</p>

<p>"But a few words," I said; "a very
few. You have aimed surely, and
struck deep. I do not blame you for
my mistake, nor for that which you
term harshness. I cannot, since I
recognize its truth. The difference
between you and most women is, that
you are brave enough to speak that
truth; for you are too free from
vanity or falsity of any kind, I know,
ever to speak other than your earnest
thoughts. I may have scoffed at
creeds; I have never scoffed at God;
give me at least this merit. I have
dreamed a dream&mdash;we all do at some
time, I believe; may yours be happy
realizations always. Good-by."</p>

<p>With a sudden glare the firelight
flashed upon the wall, and the red
glow shone full upon her face, paler
than usual, but calm. There were
tears in her eyes as they met mine;
but what woman with a woman's
heart could be unmoved at such a
moment?</p>

<p>"Good-by," she answered, almost
inaudibly. I paused to hear no more;
the next moment the door closed behind
me, and I was in the street.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p>I went abroad, through the principal
cities of the old world, and by
quiet ways to unpretending places,
where travellers seldom go. My
heart sought rest and quiet; my soul
was beginning to shake off the torpor
that had enchained it; taking in,
almost unconsciously, silent influences
that pervaded my whole being.
Truths forced themselves upon me
unawares, and my ears did not refuse
to hear them. Across the wide Atlantic
some one was praying for me,
although I did not know it while she
prayed&mdash;one whose face I vainly
strove to banish from my memory,
whose voice ran through the current
of my troubled dreams. And yet it
was with no hope of winning her love
in the future that I opened my heart
and mind to the study of sacred
things. That idea never came to
me. The whole purpose of my
life seemed changed. How often I
thought of her denunciation of my
aimless existence, my "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dilettante</i> tastes
and careless ways." How often I
thanked her that, all unconsciously
though it were, she had opened to me
new avenues of thought and action.
"Better to have loved and lost than
never to have loved at all," and so the
work went on. Silently but surely
my heart unclosed to the heavenly
dews that fell upon it and renewed it.
I remained some time in France and
Italy, spent a few months in Germany,
and then returned to England.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
At the feet of one of the fathers of the
Oratory in London I made my first
confession, and tasted the ineffable
sweetness of divine compassion.</p>

<p>Nearly two years had passed, and
the <i>dolce non far niente</i> life, so natural
once, grew wearisome now. At home
there was work for me to do; there
lay my field and my mission. I did
not attempt to disguise from myself
the pain and renewal of old wounds
that must inevitably follow my return.
However, I resolved to nerve myself
for the ordeal, and promised my timidity
the struggle would be short,
and then the world lay before me. A
world in which there were great things
to be learned and conquered.</p>

<p>I had written to Armitage once
after my departure, and received an
immediate answer, asking me to continue
the correspondence. To his
letter I had not replied, and I was
almost entirely ignorant of affairs at
home.</p>

<p>I landed in New York one bright
September day, and the first feeling
of strangeness vanished as I walked
through the crowded streets, and recognized
the familiar faces of former
acquaintances. My whilom landlady
received me with open arms; my old
quarters had just been vacated, and
I was speedily reinstalled. I had not
been in town two days, when Armitage
rushed in one evening, glad to
see me, and brimful of news.</p>

<p>"Strange freak of yours that, Ed,"
he said. "I came around here one
night by appointment; old lady met
me with the information that you had
sailed that day. I couldn't believe
it. Went to Helen's, to see if she
knew any thing about it; but she
didn't. Then I felt sure the whole
thing was a joke. You and she were
such friends that I could not think
you'd have gone off in that way,
without saying good-by. That solitary
letter of yours was worse than
none at all; provoking in you to relapse
into silence again, when a fellow
thought he had got on your track.
How soon do you intend to be off
again?"</p>

<p>"Not for a while yet," I answered.
"I think I shall remain at home now.
By the way, how is Miss Foster?&mdash;or
is she Miss Foster yet?&mdash;and her
grandmother?"</p>

<p>"The old lady died the winter after
you left New York; but Helen is living
in the homestead yet. A married
sister of mine is domiciled there too,
at present&mdash;Laura; you've heard me
speak of her. She was living in Baltimore
when you were one of us. Helen
is not married; not for the want
of suitors though; she has refused between
ten and fifty splendid offers, to
my certain knowledge."</p>

<p>"Of course she makes you her confidant?"
I said quizzingly.</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pas du tout</i>&mdash;a fine one I'd be;
but I guess all these things. She <em>is</em>
an odd girl. Not too pious, although
a devout Catholic, but hard to please.
By the way, I am due at Helen's to-night;
won't you come? You can't
expect her to call on you."</p>

<p>I made some excuse; and Fred
went off without me, promising, however,
to report me "safe and sound."
Although I knew that, sooner or later,
I should meet her, I could not face
the ordeal as yet; and preferred that,
when it did take place, the meeting
should be accidental.</p>

<p>The next week I attended a concert
at the Academy of Music. Directly
in front of me two seats remained
unoccupied until the <i>prima
donna</i> had made her first bow to the
audience, and was preluding her song
with a few prefatory trills.</p>

<p>I turned my eyes from the stage
to meet those of a lady who passed
to one of the vacant chairs; and the
next moment Fred Armitage was saying,
"You here, Moray? I am glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
we are near you. He has changed,
Nellie, don't you think?" as his companion
extended her hand in silence.
Then, as I greeted her, a single "welcome
home" fell from her lips, and
that was all.</p>

<p>No change in her. The same pure,
truthful eyes; the old-time sweetness
in her voice and smile; the old-time
charm about her still. As I looked
at her, and heard her speak, I realized
how vain had been the delusion that
prompted me to seek peace and disenchantment
within the sphere of her
influence. Once, during a pause in
the music, she asked my opinion of
the singer. I must have appeared
constrained and awkward; for I have
a half recollection of muttering some
indistinct answer. I left before the
performance was over. I did not care
to court misery&mdash;my present situation
was deplorable enough&mdash;and I was
anxious to get away from Fred's pertinacity,
which I knew would assert
itself if we went in company from the
music-hall.</p>

<p>Afterward I steadily resisted all solicitations
from Armitage to call at his
sister's; although he often expressed
a desire to introduce me. However,
having met him one day in company
with his brother-in-law, I promised
the latter gentleman to call at his residence.
Not to have done so would
have made my conduct appear eccentric
and ridiculous. About dusk the
next evening Fred came in.</p>

<p>"Come to Auvergne's with me to-night,"
he said. "Walter has gone
to Baltimore on business, and Helen
with him. She intends spending the
winter with some relatives there.
Laura is alone, and may be we could
cheer her up. I am sorry Walter and
Nellie are absent; but you'll get acquainted
with the best little woman in
the world."</p>

<p>There was no help for it. The present,
too, afforded the best opportunity.
I went, and received a cordial
welcome from Mrs. Auvergne, who
was all that her brother had described
her, and more.</p>

<p>"So this is Mr. Moray," she said,
as Fred introduced me. "I have
heard of you so frequently that I
know you already. And Helen has
sometimes mentioned you."</p>

<p>The evening passed pleasantly. As
we were about leaving, our hostess
warmly invited me to renew the visit.
"Come soon, and as often as you
like," she said; "we shall be always
pleased to see you."</p>

<p>Inconsistently enough, I departed
from my proposed line of conduct in
so far as to accept her invitation. It
was lonely sitting in my bachelor
abode those long winter evenings;
and, after five or six weeks' acquaintance,
I had called so frequently at
Mrs. Auvergne's as to feel more at
home there than anywhere else in
New York. I did not think much of
the future, of the difficulties that must
arise when another member of the
family should resume her place in the
circle; or, if I did, I was wise or foolish
enough not to anticipate them.</p>

<p>Meeting Mr. Auvergne near home
one evening, he brought me <i>nolens
volens</i> in to tea. We found his wife
in the parlor, with her three charming
little girls, who had become great
friends of mine, and who knew me
under the title of "Uncle Fred's
brother."</p>

<p>"Something for you, Laura," said
Paterfamilias, as he threw a letter into
her lap.</p>

<p>"From Helen, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes; excuse me, Mr. Moray, while
I glance over it. I always give Helen's
letters two or three readings.
She is growing quite dissipated. 'I
have been to three parties this week,'
she writes; 'much against my inclination,
you will imagine. But Maud
and Alice lead such gay lives that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
one is kept in a perpetual round of
sight-seeing and enjoyment&mdash;as the
world goes. I could never be content
to live this way; and feel dubious
as to whether I can find it compatible
with real duties at home to remain
the promised time. You reproached
me before I went away with
being low-spirited, Laura. Your panacea
has not proved beneficial. I
am, if not melancholy, not half so
cheerful in my mind, as Fred would
say, as when I left you. So don't be
surprised to see me any morning
about breakfast time. Tell the children,
Cousin Helen is glad they have
found a new friend; but"&mdash;here the
reader paused; and, after a hurried
perusal of the remainder, replaced the
missive in its envelope.</p>

<p>"Foolish Helen!" she said, as
though talking to herself; then, supper
being announced, there was nothing
more said on the subject.</p>

<p>On Christmas eve I called with
some presents for the children. I
had promised them to enlist Santa
Claus in their favor, and waited until
I thought they would be asleep to
bring what toys and trinkets they had
told me confidentially would be acceptable.
Ushered into the parlor,
I did not at first perceive in the dim
light that some one was standing near
the window. The noise of the door
closing caused the occupant of the
room to look round, and, as she did
so, I recognized Miss Foster.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," I managed to articulate
in my surprise; "I did not
know you had returned, or that you
were expected."</p>

<p>"I was not expected," she answered
smilingly. "But I grew homesick
as Christmas approached, and astonished
them all this morning at
daylight. Will you sit down, Mr.
Moray?" And she drew a chair forward.</p>

<p>"Thank you," I replied, "not this
evening. I have merely brought
some trifles for the little ones. We
are great friends. I have become
quite at home with them during your
absence."</p>

<p>"So Laura tells me," she answered;
"and they have not been silent
either. They are very lovable children."</p>

<p>"I have found them so," I rejoined.
"I suppose they are all three dreaming
of Santa Claus at this moment.
But I must be going. Be kind
enough to present my compliments
to Mrs. Auvergne, who is probably
busy this evening. And allow me to
wish you a very merry Christmas."</p>

<p>As I ceased speaking, the parlor
door opened and the mistress of the
house entered, bonneted and shawled
for a walk, and accompanied by Fred,
who announced himself a complete
wreck from a frolic in the nursery.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Moray," said
the little lady cordially. "These for
the children? Thank you; you are
very kind; they will be so delighted.
You see our wanderer has returned.
Is she not looking well? Sit down,
you must not go yet. Rather late
for a lady to go shopping, is it not?
But I want something down-town,
and Fred has volunteered to accompany
me. We shall not be absent
long; you must stay till we return.
You and Helen are old friends, I
know, and can manage to pass an
hour pleasantly together."</p>

<p>I fancied Helen looked at me imploringly,
as though to say, "Do
go away," and I ventured to remonstrate.</p>

<p>"I am inexorable," was the reply.
"You are to remain till we come
back. Fred, take his gloves; and
Helen, ring for lights."</p>

<p>There was no withstanding such
importunity. Reluctantly, but with
as good grace as I could summon, I
allowed myself to succumb to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
force of circumstances. Seeing there
was no help for it, my companion in
distress took some fancy knitting from
a table near her, and soon appeared
lost in its intricacies. For fully five
minutes after the door closed on Mrs.
Auvergne and her brother we sat in
embarrassing silence&mdash;silence that at
length grew unendurable.</p>

<p>"You are sitting too far from the
fire," I said, by way of endeavor to
mend matters; "there must be some
draught from that window too."</p>

<p>"I prefer being near the light," she
answered, without looking up; "and
I am not at all cold."</p>

<p>Another five minutes of silence.
What should I say next? Could I
sit there much longer? I did not
think so. I felt as though I must make
a desperate move and take my leave.</p>

<p>Suddenly, pealing out upon the
silent night, I heard the sound of
bells. She heard them too, I knew,
for I saw her lift her head to listen.</p>

<p>"The Christmas chimes," I said;
"how beautifully they sound. I have
heard them in Rome and Naples;
last year I was in England at this
season; but home music has charms
peculiar to itself, and dearer than all
other&mdash;at least so it seems to me."</p>

<p>"You believe in Christmas, then, as
an institution?" she answered smilingly,
and with a touch of the old sarcasm
in her voice.</p>

<p>"Surely," I replied gravely, "since
I believe in Christ. Inasmuch as a
Catholic believes and reverences all
that his church teaches and believes."</p>

<p>I looked at her face to see what
effect my words would have, but it
evinced no emotion of surprise. She
answered quietly and assuredly, as
though our ways had never been
separate,</p>

<p>"Yes, we who are Catholics enjoy
the capacity of feeling and appreciating
these things as none do beside.
Especially converts such as you and
I, who have known the experience
of doubt and fear."</p>

<p>"I was not aware," I rejoined,
"that you knew of my conversion."</p>

<p>"No?" she replied. "I have known
it some time, having seen you several
times at Mass and Benediction. I
do not believe you would make the
sign of the cross unless you held it to
be the sign of salvation. And you do
make it, I think."</p>

<p>"No doubt the discovery surprised
you, Miss Foster," I continued.</p>

<p>"No, it did not," she answered.
"I did not think the change would
be accomplished so soon, but I hoped
great things for you."</p>

<p>"Even when you accused me most
bitterly?" Why tread on dangerous
ground; but the words were spoken,
and I could not recall them.</p>

<p>"Even when I accused you most
bitterly," she said, in a low tone.</p>

<p>"You are far-sighted, I perceive.
Perhaps you may also have some
idea of the manner in which this
change was brought about. Perhaps
I may have felt, may still feel, an
indebtedness to some one, to whom
it has been a matter of doubt with me
as to whether I should acknowledge
the obligation, or suffer it to go unpaid."</p>

<p>"I may have an idea," she replied,
"yet not just such a one as that to
which you make allusion. Some one
may have been instrumental in awakening
thought on the subject. But
I have not been able to advance the
idea further."</p>

<p>For a moment I sat silent. "Shall
I tell her what she has done for me?"
I asked myself; "shall I open the old
wound and let it bleed afresh? Will
it be any sacrifice of my manliness if
I tell her what a few moments ago I
held it my duty and purpose to conceal?"</p>

<p>I drew my gaze from the fire and
directed it toward her. The ivory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
needle flew in and out between her
slender fingers; it seemed she had a
task to do. My resolve was taken.
But there was not the shadow of a
hope in my soul when I spoke.
Something impelled me&mdash;something,
I knew not what; a desperate spirit,
I thought it then; my good angel, I
know now.</p>

<p>"There is a debt and an obligation,"
I began, "and an acknowledgment
which I am proud to make,
although the fact of its existence be
almost death to me. A little more
than two years ago, circumstances led
to the revelation of that which but for
those circumstances might have been
unrevealed to-day. I offered you a
love that had grown in my heart until
it interpenetrated every fibre of my
being. You rejected it; and that you
did so, or why, I find no fault or
blame. The folly was mine; I alone
have borne the consequences. But
while you disabused my mind of any
wild hope it might have cherished in
moments quite as wild, you told me
some unpalatable truths. Until I met
you I had lived a selfish, useless life.
After I met you, the germs of something
better in me stirred now and
then, and impulses that I more than
once fought down knocked at secret
doors where the dust and cobwebs of
the world had gathered. Then the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dénouement</i> came, and after it the
change in me."</p>

<p>Still knitting, the soft wool flew
through her fingers faster and faster,
as though she bade defiance to my
moan. She did not look up as I
paused, but her lips were compressed
and her cheek brightly flushed.</p>

<p>"I went away loving you. Far
away from your visible influence, the
thought of you followed me through
all my journeyings. I passed through
new scenes and experiences loving
you; I come back loving you still.
I am here to-night with no intent of
pleading a lost cause, with no hope
of drifting from desolate seas into
pleasant waters, with no dream of
Lethean draughts to be taken from
your hands. As in the former instance,
circumstances have forced it all upon
me. To-morrow I shall wonder at
the folly which prompts me to say
what I am saying. But to-night, before
I close the book for ever, let me
thank you for what you have done
for me; let me leave you with the
knowledge that, while I have been
rash and presumptuous, I have not
offended you or caused you pain."</p>

<p>She had risen from her chair while
I was speaking. Standing for a moment
irresolute, with lips half parted
and eyes downcast, she made a passionate
gesture with her clasped hands,
as though impatient with herself.</p>

<p>"I do not forget," she said, "any
part of what I told you that night,
two years ago. I was harsh&mdash;unnecessarily
so. But it all came on me so
suddenly that I hardly knew what I
did say. I remember there was something
about misused talents and a
wasted life, of what you might be and
were not, of great possibilities slighted
and contemned. But," here her
voice faltered and the words came
slowly, "I do not remember telling
you then or at any other time that I
did not, could not love you. Do you
remember it?" Looking up, her gaze
met mine half smilingly, half tearfully.</p>

<p>"No, I do not remember it," I said;
"but you sent me away from you, and
I have not forgotten that there was
nothing of encouragement for the future
in your dismissal of me. Can it
be&mdash;dare I hope that&mdash;that&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Somehow two warm, soft hands
were clasped in mine, and the Christmas
bells pealed out a tuneful chime,
now softly low, now musically clear.
And then she told me what I had
never even fancied in my dreams: of
the love that had dwelt in her heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
of hearts so long; of fears that had
assailed her when she grew conscious
of it; of a hope in the future and its
unborn possibilities that had filled her
soul when she seemed most indifferent
and cold; of prayers that from their
fervency had been heard and answered.</p>

<p>"I knew you would come back to
me," she said; "I knew that God would
do great things for you. And even if
you had not come; if some one else
had taken my place, or some ambition
occupied your heart, it would have
been the same in the end, or nearly so.
I think I could be contented to love
you silently all my life long, if I knew
you to be in thought and purpose
what I had so longed to have you; if
I felt that my prayers for you were
heard and answered."</p>

<p>O wonderful unselfishness of woman's
love! O marvellous constancy
of woman's faith! How often do ye
burn and die away unheeded and unprized
on hollow altars!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Three short bright years have passed,
and it is Christmas eve. Outside I
hear a group of merry boys, battling
with the bitter wind and laughing at
its fierceness. Frost glitters on the
window-panes and chills the air to-night;
and blazing fires roar up the
chimneys, pouring forth a welcome as
they go. Here, in this quiet room,
there is an atmosphere of peace and
calm content that almost fills me with
a reverential fear lest the sweet spell
should float away and leave me desolate.</p>

<p>I can watch her all unnoticed as
she sits in the deep shadow of the firelight,
the angel of my hearth and
home. The face is perhaps a shade
more thoughtful than of old; but the
bright head, golden brown, has still the
same graceful poise and movement;
the truthful eyes are still as kind and
tender as of yore.</p>

<p>And as she sits there musing, I lay
down my busy pen, and my full heart
throbs with gratitude and thankfulness,
as I think how lonely life would
be without her this happy Christmas
Eve.</p>

<h2>MISCELLANY.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The Council.</span>&mdash;It is said that the
Cardinals de Reisach and Cullen, and
the Archbishops Manning and Spalding,
have been appointed on the commission
for treating with those Protestants who
may come to the council for that purpose.
Bishops and priests speaking twenty-eight
different languages had applied
to the cardinal vicar for permission to
say mass, and confessionals for confessors
speaking eighteen languages are
provided in St. Peter's. The great
variety of complexions and costumes
now to be seen in Rome excites much
remark in the letters of correspondents.
The Archbishop of Lima, who is ninety-four
years of age, being unable to attend
the council, has sent to the Pope a pastoral
staff of gold valued at two thousand
pounds. The students of Quito
University have sent him all their gold
and silver medals of honor, and the
President of the Republic of Ecuador
has sent a jewelled medal given him by
the state as an official decoration. An
Italian priest, D. Mariano Matteini, has
himself designed and made a small bell
for the Pope's use during the council,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
which is a perfect gem of artistic ornamentation.
It bears the appropriate inscription,</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Invocatâ Immaculatâ, Pius Nonus pastor bonus,
per concilium fert auxilium. Mundus crebris tot
tenebris, implicatus, obc&oelig;catus, per hoc Numen et
hoc lumen, extricatur, illustratur.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>The early date of going to press forbids
our giving any notice of the solemn
opening of the council in the great
Basilica of St. Peter, which will have
taken place before this number is published.
We hope to have constant and
authentic communications respecting
the council, directly from Rome, in our
ensuing numbers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Abjuration of the Protestant
Minister of Cordova.</span>&mdash;Don Antonio
Soler, an apostate priest, who
has for the past nine years officiated as
Protestant pastor at Cordova, in Spain,
has publicly abjured his heresy in presence
of the clergy, magistrates, and a
large concourse of the people of the city.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Eastern Affairs.</span>&mdash;The <cite>Civilta
Cattolica</cite> gives a very interesting account
of a council of bishops of the
Latin rite, in the East, held at Smyrna
last Pentecost. Mgr. Spaccapietra,
Latin Archbishop of Smyrna,
presided as apostolic delegate; three
other archbishops, five bishops, and a
deputy from the Latin church at Constantinople
were present. The sessions
were conducted with great splendor, and
attended by vast crowds, both of Catholics
and schismatics. A council of the
Catholic hierarchy of the Armenian
rite was celebrated at the Armenian
cathedral of St. Mary, in Constantinople,
on the seventeenth of July. The
patriarch presided, and eighteen bishops
were in attendance. On this occasion
a large relic of St. Gregory the
Illuminator, presented by Pius IX., was
brought to the church in procession, and
there deposited. The splendid procession
of the bishops, accompanied by a
large body of the clergy, was escorted
by a detachment of Turkish soldiers,
and witnessed by a vast concourse of
people. Solemn mass was then celebrated
by the patriarch, and the council
inaugurated. This was the most open
and splendid display of the Christian
religion which has ever been made in
Constantinople since it came under Mohammedan
rule. Since that time, the
same church has witnessed a ceremony
of equal if not greater splendor and
significance, on the occasion of the
visit of the Empress Eugénie. At the
close of the high mass, at which the
empress assisted in state, she gave an
illustrious example of that piety and
Christian humility so frequent among
royal personages in former times, but
now so rare among the great. Rising from
her throne to exchange the customary
marks of respect and honor with the bishops
who passed before her, when the
patriarch bowed to her, and was about
to move on, she requested him to pause a
moment; bending over, she kissed his
ring, and, descending from the dais of
the throne, prostrated herself before
him to receive his blessing. This was
done in presence of her brilliant suite
of French and Turkish officers, and of
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élite</i> of the Christians of Constantinople.
We trust the example of the
most illustrious lady of Christendom will
not be lost on Christian women in a high
social position throughout the world.</p>

<p>It appears from the Greek papers that
Nilus, the so-called Patriarch of Alexandria,
whose impertinent reply to the
Pope's missive of summons to the council
gave so much joy to our Episcopalian
neighbors, was an intruder. This
monk was for a time supported in his
position as designated successor to the
actual patriarch, and administrator, by
the viceroy. Giving out that the patriarch
was ill, and had intrusted him
with delegated powers, he kept him as
a prisoner in his palace. He was denounced
by the Patriarch of Constantinople,
and at length abandoned by the
viceroy, and, as says the <cite>Byzantine
Telegraph</cite>, "this vainglorious monk, not
being able any longer to resist the popular
outcry and contempt, abandoned by
the government and by his few friends,
succeeded in escaping the anger of the
people by leaving Egypt."</p>

<p>A letter from the Patriarch of Constantinople
to the Archbishop of Canterbury
has been published, which is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>
masterpiece of Greek irony. With a
profusion of compliments, he acknowledges
the receipt of a copy of the acts
of the Pan-Anglican Synod, and of the
Anglican Prayer-Book, and then proceeds
to condemn the latter as heretical
and insulting to the Eastern Church in
a manner which cannot be very palatable
to those who have sought to win from
him a nod of recognition.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Hindostan.</span>&mdash;Every one who has
read the accounts published in the papers
of the new Hindoo sect, under the
direction of Baboo Chunder Sen, called
the <cite>Brahmo Somaj</cite>, must have seen the
great interest and importance of this
movement. <cite>The Dublin Review</cite> furnishes
us with a great deal of valuable
information about this matter, and the
relation generally of Hindooism to
Christianity in India, accompanied by
most curious extracts from publications
of the party of Chunder Sen, written in
very nervous but peculiar English. It
is surprising to see with what force and
keenness these educated Hindoos pierce
and destroy the inconsistent fabric of
Protestantism, which they call a system
of "paper revelation and second-hand
religion," whose untenable position is
shown by the fact that it gives twenty
different interpretations of the same
t book. We are most happy to learn that
Bishop Meurer, S.J., the Vicar Apostolic
of Bombay, is about to recommence the
missionary enterprise of De Nobili, so
shamefully and stupidly thwarted by the
enemies of the Jesuits. He intends to
found a missionary college, whose pupils
will be thoroughly instructed in Brahminical
and Buddhist literature, and
when they are sent out on missions, will
enrol themselves in one of the high
castes, adopting their dress and customs.
In this way the Catholic religion will
be brought in contact with the educated
Hindoos, who at present know it only
through the misrepresentations of Protestant
missionaries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. Lecointre on the Passage of
the Red Sea.</span>&mdash;M. Lecointre, a graduate
of the Polytechnic School and chief
engineer of the iron works connected
with the Suez Canal, has investigated,
with the assistance of M. de Lesseps,
the question of the place where the Israelites
crossed the Red Sea, and publishes
his conclusions in the <cite  lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Etudes
Religieuses</cite> of Paris, accompanied by
a map. He gives, in the first place, a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">résumé</i> of the events of the march out
of Egypt. Pharaoh feared an immense
conspiracy under the leadership of
Moses, and, as Josephus relates, formed
an army of 250,000 men, which was assembled
at Memphis. The events related
in Exodus forced him to give the
denied permission to the Israelites to
go into the wilderness to sacrifice. He
well knew the real intention of Moses,
which was no secret, either, to the people
themselves, to quit Egypt for ever. The
orders for preparing to celebrate the
passover on the 14th of Nisan had
been given by Moses through the chiefs
of tribes some days before. These orders
had the effect of arranging the people
in little groups under a head, as the
best organization for a sudden march;
for which they were well prepared by
a substantial meal and the enlivening
effect of a festivity. The signal of departure
was probably given by signal-fires
previously arranged. The march
to Palestine was not expected to occupy
more than twenty or twenty-five days,
by a route well known and provided
with water, and the flocks and herds
which they took with them assured
them a plentiful subsistence. The
main body left from Rameses, a city
where a great proportion of them dwelt,
the others starting from the other places
of their residence and moving toward
a common rendezvous. Their first halting-place
was Succoth, where they waited
for those who were behind to come up;
the second at Etham, on the border of
the desert, from whence they expected
to go directly into the desert above the
Red Sea, and to take a direct route for
Palestine. But Moses changed his
route, brought them back along the coast
of the Red Sea, and encamped in the
plain of Pi-hahiroth, between Magdal
and the sea, where they were surprised
by Pharaoh's army in a situation which
rendered flight in any direction impossible.
The miraculous events which followed
are well known. The point of passage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
is placed on the twentieth parallel
of latitude, which nearly bisects the larger
one of the Bitter Lakes, now separated
from, but formerly forming a part
of the Red Sea. The events related by
Moses would then probably have occurred
as follows. On the night of the
15th, the nucleus of the host made a
short stage from Rameses to Succoth,
waiting from the morning of the 15th to
the morning of the 16th for the entire
host to arrive. Distance travelled, five
kilometres. Distance from Succoth to
the most remote points of Gessen, where
the Israelites lived, forty to fifty kilometres,
easily travelled in twenty-four
hours. Moses and Aaron could have
made the journey from Memphis on the
15th on horseback, a distance of one
hundred and twelve kilometres, in ten or
twelve hours. On the 16th, from Succoth
to Etham, twenty-two kilometres. On the
17th, from. Etham to Pi-hahiroth, twenty
to twenty-two kilometres. From the evening
of the 17th to the evening of the 20th,
encampment at Pi-hahiroth. The change
of route at Etham is supposed to have
alarmed the Egyptian commander at
that post, who sends a courier on the
morning of the 17th to Memphis, one
hundred and twenty-four kilometres, a
distance which could be passed in twelve
or fifteen hours by a swift horse or
dromedary. On the 18th, the army
marches from Memphis in a straight
line for Beelsephon, a distance of one
hundred and twelve kilometres. On
the morning of the 20th, the advance-guard
of cavalry, after a march of forty-eight
hours, arrives on the heights of
Beelsephon, cutting off the retreat of the
Israelites. A heavy fog separates the
two armies. The Egyptian infantry comes
up on the 21st. During the night of the
20th, the Israelites pass the Red Sea,
whose width was from ten to twelve
kilometres; they are followed by the
cavalry and chariots on the morning of
the 21st, who traverse five or six kilometres,
when they are overwhelmed by the
returning waters, the main body witnessing
the catastrophe from the heights behind.
The march from Memphis requires
for the cavalry two stages of fifty-six
kilometres and for the infantry three of
thirty-eight, which the author says is
within the power of fresh, well-equipped
troops.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Reform Movement among the
Jews.</span>&mdash;The recent convention of Jews
at Philadelphia appears to have been
the work of a party bent on radical and
destructive reforms. The orthodox and
conservative Jews condemn it wholly.
We should be very sorry to see the
synagogue converted into a poor imitation
of the most radical Protestant
sects, and this ancient, wonderfully preserved
nation blended with the mass
of other peoples. The ancient and
venerable observances of Judaism, and
the continued distinct existence of the
people descended from the patriarchs,
are a palpable, living witness to the
divine origin of revelation, and the inspired
truth of the writings of Moses
and the prophets, the basis of Christianity.
The reforming Jews are the successors
of those who imitated the heathen
in the reign of Antiochus and of
the infidel Sadducees. Their approximation
to Protestantism is not an approximation
to Christianity but to infidelity,
and, if carried out successfully,
would destroy their nation. This cannot
be done, however. We believe firmly
that the nation is indestructible, is
destined to be restored to the possession
of Palestine, and to fulfil literally
the predictions of the ancient prophets
in such a manner as to furnish the
most splendid proof of the truth of the
divine religion handed down through
Sem, Abraham, Moses, the Prophets,
to the Messiah to whom shall be the
expectation of nations. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alieni non transibunt
per Jerusalem amplius; nam in
illa die stillabunt montes dulcedinem,
et colles fluent lac et mel, dicit Dominus.</i>
It is the infidel party among the Jews
of Europe that is leagued with infidels
of Christian origin in the war on the
Catholic Church. Those who adhere
strictly to their law have many principles
in common with Catholics. Their
law of marriage with those of their own
nation exclusively harmonizes with that
of the Catholic Church, which forbids
intermarriage with them. Their genuine
and ancient ritual bears witness to the
antiquity of the liturgical and ceremonial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
idea embodied in Catholic worship.
Their principle that the education of
the youth should be religious is identical
with ours, and we hope they will insist
on the right of having separate
schools and their just quota of the funds
raised by taxation for purposes of education.
So long as they remain in exile
from their proper home, and separated
from us in religion, we cannot desire
any thing else than to see them adhere
to their ancient customs. They do not
seek to proselyte; their prosperity is
therefore in no way dangerous to the
Catholic Church. The more splendid
their synagogues and the observance
of their traditional rites, the more brilliant
is the testimony they give to those
facts and events in sacred history denied
by infidel Jews and infidel Christians
alike.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Education Question.</span>&mdash;<cite>The
New-Englander</cite>, as the organ of the
venerable Yale University, has recently
contained some admirable articles on
the methods of promoting the higher
education. It makes war upon bogus
universities, colleges, and systems with
calm but resolute force. Among the
sound and sensible suggestions it makes,
these are some of the chief ones: (1)
The preparatory schools should be improved
by a more thorough and extensive
course of study in the classics, and
in some of the modern languages. (2)
The collegiate course should be correspondingly
improved, and modified, by
imitating in part the tutor system of the
English universities; but, by no means,
changed into the loose system of misnamed
universities. (3) The university
should be gradually formed as a sequence
of the improved collegiate system,
and should consist of the college
proper, together with post-graduate
courses of higher studies in all the
branches of science. The necessity of
religious instruction is unanswerably
proved, and the especial fitness of clergymen
for the work of education well
defended and advocated. The necessity
of having every college under the religious
care of some one denomination is
also satisfactorily shown. We wonder
that the remarkably frank and candid
writer in <cite>The New-Englander</cite> does not
see, however, that he has proved this
necessity as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pis aller</i>, and indirectly
furnished a terrible argument against
his own sect and all Protestantism. He
directly acknowledges that it is necessary
to have <i>sectarian</i> teachers; that,
nevertheless, sectarianism is too narrow
a thing for a liberal university, and that
the teachers must suppress their sectarianism
and teach in a sort of catholic
spirit. This is as clear a proof as we
could wish to have that Protestantism
is incompetent to the function of a religious
teacher, and, therefore, that a perfect
university cannot exist except in
the Catholic Church. We hope, at all
events, that the influence of New Haven
will be thrown fully and consistently
against godless schools of all sorts, and
in favor of the right of parents to have
schools where their children can be
taught the religion which they themselves
profess.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Christian World on the

editorial remark, the last clause of
which we would especially recommend
to the attention of all our opponents,
the editors of <cite>The Christian World</cite> included:
"The interest awakened by
the present discussion of this subject
leads us to print the foregoing. There
is much of force in Mr. Seymour's
statements and reasonings respecting
the matter of homicide, even though a
double or treble percentage is allowed
for Protestant England. But we are
constrained to say, in the interest of
fair dealing, that the remaining statistics
of Mr. S. respecting illegitimacy seem
to us to lack the precision and discrimination
essential to a conclusive argument
in that direction. Moreover, the
force of these statistics is, to say the
least, greatly counteracted by the admitted
facts respecting f&oelig;ticide charged

<h2>NEW PUBLICATIONS.</h2>


<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">The &OElig;cumenical Council and the
Infallibility of the Roman Pontiff</span>:
A Pastoral Letter to the Clergy,
etc. By Henry Edward, Archbishop
of Westminster. London: Longmans,
Green &amp; Co. Pp. 151.</p>

<p>We have received within the past
two months five or six dissertations on
the question of the infallibility of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex cathedrâ</i> judgments of the sovereign
pontiffs and other closely connected
topics, written by some of the best
theologians in Europe. They handle
the subject with great learning and ability,
and in a manner much more satisfactory
and to the point than is usually
found in treatises on the same topic in
our theological text-books or popular expositions
of doctrine. The reason is, that
the controversy has been revived and assumed
a new importance since the indiction
of the council, and that the advocates
of what is commonly called ultramontane
doctrine have applied themselves intently
to seize hold of and minutely
analyze and refute the objections of the
opposite party, who have themselves endeavored
to bring up anew all these objections
with as much force as possible.
Archbishop Manning has given us one
of these learned dissertations in the form
of a pastoral letter, which makes a considerable
pamphlet, divided into four
chapters. The first chapter is on the
effect of the council already felt in England
and France. The second is on the
opportuneness of defining the infallibility
of the Roman pontiff, in which he
discusses (1) The reasons against the
definition; (2) answers to these reasons;
(3) reasons for the definition.
In the third chapter he makes a concise
but very copious exposition of the tradition
on the subject, tracing it backward
from the Council of Constance to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
of Chalcedon, and afterward giving a
history of the Gallican controversy since
the time of the Council of Constance.
The fourth chapter is on the effect which
the council is certain to produce on the
evidence and proposition of the faith,
and on the relations of civil governments
to the church. A postscript is added
on the recent defence of Gallican doctrine
by Mgr. Maret. The most noteworthy
and distinctive feature of this
very learned and lucidly written document
is, the manner in which the reasons
why the council should issue a clear and
precise definition of the true doctrine
held by the church are presented. The
illustrious archbishop argues with great
force that an omission to make such a
definition will be interpreted as a tacit
permission to hold and teach the Gallican
opinions as sound and safe probable
opinions. There can be no doubt that
his views and those of prelates in equally
eminent positions who have publicly
expressed themselves in equivalent
terms will receive that grave consideration
from the bishops of the Catholic
Church in council which they merit. Undoubtedly,
also, those who may hold
different opinions will have the most
ample liberty of arguing their side of
the question. The decision of the council
must be accepted by all as final and
infallible; and if such a decision is rendered,
the controversy will be set at rest
for ever; a consummation, in our opinion,
devoutly to be wished.</p>

<p>We will venture to add a few words
of our own to the point of the argument
presented by the Archbishop of Westminster.
The ultramontane doctrine
has been almost universally held and
taught in the Catholic Church in the
United States. Nevertheless, the manner
of handling the Protestant controversy
in many English books, some of
which are translations from French
authors, has been such as to create an
impression that the doctrine of the infallibility
of the pope in definitions of
faith is merely a pious opinion. This is
supported by the fact that the opposite
opinion has not been formally condemned,
and that those who held it have been
recognized as in full communion with
the Roman Church, and even raised to
eminent positions in the hierarchy. This
same impression has been created in
other countries as well as in our own,
and exists to a very great extent in the
mind of the Catholic laity as well as to
some extent in that of the clergy.
The real facts in the case are not fully
known. It is not generally known that
those who have carried the Gallican
opinions so far, and reduced them to
practice in so consistent a manner, as to
refuse implicit obedience and unreserved
interior submission to the pontifical
decretals, or who have appealed from
papal decisions to an &oelig;cumenical council,
have been condemned under censure
of excommunication, that the whole
church has given their assent to this
judgment, and that it is a point of the
canon law. The truth is, that the holy
see has always regarded the Gallican
opinions as erroneous, although it has
judged it wisest to tolerate them thus
far, and to proceed by the way of instruction
and inculcation in teaching
the opposite doctrine, waiting until the
complete discussion of the subject by
theologians and the pastoral teaching
of the bishops should have brought
such a flood of light on the subject that
the truth should gain over the intelligence
of enlightened Catholics, before
pronouncing a formal and definitive
judgment. There is a great danger,
however, that this cautious and indulgent
treatment of those who have held
Gallican opinions in good faith and with
a practical submission to the supreme
authority of the holy see, may give an
advantage to bold and indocile spirits to
make the toleration of these opinions a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">point d'appui</i> for a resistance to the
teaching of the sovereign pontiffs <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex
cathedrâ</i>, having in it a schismatical and
heretical tendency. The defenders and
advocates of sound doctrines are placed
at a disadvantage by the lack of a definitive
judgment declaring the sense of
the church in such a manner as to preclude
all dispute or ambiguity of interpretation.
There can be no question
that the holy see, and the great body
of bishops, including those of France
with few exceptions, hold the doctrine
of the papal infallibility to be a certainly
revealed truth contained in Scripture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
and tradition, and consequently regard
the contrary opinion as an error which
has only been for a time tolerated. The
whole action of the church is regulated
by this view, and will always be so regulated.
There appears, therefore, to
be a very strong reason why the present
council should put the whole question at
rest for ever by a final decision and a definition
<i>de fide</i>. We can answer for the
clergy and laity of the United States
that they will welcome such a decision
with the greatest joy. As for the objection
that it will place an obstacle in the
way of conversions, it is groundless.
Those who are solidly converted from
Protestantism in this country are converted
to Catholicity pure and simple,
and not to Catholicity with a Gallican
reservation.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">The Woman who Dared.</span> By Epes
Sargent. Boston: Roberts Brothers.
1870. 18mo, pp. 210.</p>

<p>We have every disposition in the
world to treat Mr. Epes Sargent with
respect, and to speak well of this his
latest poem; for he has a name in the
literary world, and his poem is not
without some artistic merit; but, unhappily,
we can do neither with a good
conscience. We cannot tolerate false
doctrines, mischievous sophistry, and
bad morals, because expressed in chaste
language and attractive verse. Mr.
Sargent has poetic feeling and talent;
but we do not accept the doctrine that
art is necessarily moral or religious.
It may be used to embellish error
as well as truth, vice as well as virtue,
to corrupt as well as to purify and ennoble.
In the poem before us the
poet has used all his art, genius, and
talent to seduce his readers to swallow
as a wholesome Christian beverage a
most poisonous compound of spiritism,
free-lovism, woman's-rightsism, rationalism,
and all sorts of radicalism.</p>

<p>No doubt we shall be told that the
poet is sincere, and that he really believes
that he is chanting a great truth,
and laboring in downright earnest to
develop and confirm a purer and higher
civilization than the world has ever yet
known. It is not unlikely that Eve
thought as much when, seduced by the
subtle reasonings and false promises of
the serpent, she reached forth her hand,
plucked and ate the forbidden fruit, and
gave of the same to her husband; but
this did not excuse her for violating the
command of God, or save her from expulsion
from paradise. Men who have
no infallible criterion of truth and falsehood,
no infallible standard of right and
wrong, have no authority from God to
teach, and no right to open their mouths
on any subject that seriously affects
the interests or the conduct of life. No
one, on the strength of his own personal
conviction alone, has the right to arraign
and condemn what the common
sense and experience of mankind in all
ages and nations have sanctioned. It
is no justification, no valid excuse even,
for a man who promulgates and does
his best to get accepted false and mischievous
doctrines&mdash;doctrines which
weaken the hold of religion on the conscience,
pervert the moral sense, render
the family impossible, and sap the very
foundation of society&mdash;to say, "I am
sincere; I really believe I am laboring
for a true and much needed reform."
Do you <em>know</em> it? Do you not know
that you do <em>not</em> know it? Do you not
know that all the presumptions are
against you? Uncertain as you are and
must be if you ever think, why attempt
to teach at all? Who compels you?
Men are accountable for the thoughts
and intents of the heart no less than
for outward acts, and God will bring
every man into judgment for every
thought and word as well as for every
deed. Every man is bound to conform
his thoughts, words, and deeds to the
law of God, and to use with all diligence
his faculties to ascertain that law and
what it enjoins. Invincible ignorance
excuses from sin, it is true, one in that
whereof one is invincibly ignorant; but
an ignorance that may be overcome by
due diligence and the proper use of the
means within one's reach, is not invincible,
but vincible, and therefore no excuse.
The man or the woman that can
seriously entertain the doctrine and
morals of Mr. Sargent's poem cannot
plead invincible ignorance; but must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span>
under a delusion never possible in the
case of the pure in heart, or to any but
those who take pleasure in iniquity.</p>

<p>We have no intention of reopening
the discussion of the woman question,
or that of spiritists and spiritism; the
questions of divorce and free religion
have also been amply discussed, at
least for the present, in this magazine.
We can touch here only on two questions
raised by the author&mdash;that of free-love
and that of the right and propriety
of female wooing. The aim of the author
has been to defend the woman who
dared woo openly and in plain words
the man she wished to be her husband
and the father of her child. He contends,
in the smoothest and most seductive
blank-verse he is master of, that
this is proper, and woman's right; and
that it is only the tyranny of a barbarous
custom, created by male predominance,
that requires the woman to wait till she
is sought. Linda Percival, the bastard
daughter of a bigamist, is for him the model
woman. She dares break through
this custom and proposes to a very respectable
young gentleman; but gets
at first the mitten, and succeeds finally
only by buying him up for a hundred
thousand dollars in hard cash, paid
down to his swindled and bankrupt
father. Yet Linda is a combination of
incompatible qualities, an impossible
woman, a monster in nature, and her
conduct is no precedent for the sex.
She is a man-woman, and the last in
the world that a real man could love or
marry. The woman who does not instinctively
shrink from soliciting a man
to marry her could appreciate no argument
that would prove its impropriety or
the gross immorality that would result
from the practice, were it once held
reputable. Mr. Sargent knows well
enough, without our telling him, that
nature has made woman strong for defence,
but weak when acting on the
offensive. When she solicits a man to
be her husband and "the father of her
child," she steps out from her strong
fortress of modesty and reserve, throws
off her defensive armor, and places herself
at his mercy. Resistance afterward
avails nothing. She has surrendered
at discretion. No training on
either side can protect her virtue, secure
her respect, or belief in the purity of
her intentions; for no education or
training can reverse nature. The practice,
if adopted and become general,
would degrade woman to the lowest
level, put an end to marriage, extinguish
the family, and with it society and the
race.</p>

<p>Mr. Sargent, whether he intends it or
not, advocates free-love as he does free
religion. Love, he says, must be free,
and bound by no chain but its own
silken cords. The least constraint kills
it. The marriage is all in the mutual
love; and when that leaves, the marriage
is dissolved. To compel a couple who
do not mutually love to come together,
or, after the love is dead, to live together,
as husband and wife&mdash;we beg
pardon, as wife and husband&mdash;is downright
tyranny, outrageous cruelty. This
is the cant of nearly all female and
much of male popular literature, which
relies for its tragic interest on the obstacles
thrown in the way of true love
by an imperious mother, a despotic father,
a hard-hearted old uncle, barbarous
custom, or cruel and tyrannous
marriage laws. This literature, the
only literature except newspapers this
restless, busy age reads, has already
corrupted modern society, made away
with parental authority, obliterated the
love and reverence of children for their
parents, and rendered a happy household
well-nigh impossible.</p>

<p>This popular doctrine mistakes the
love marriage demands as well as the
nature and end of marriage itself. The
love it extols is at best only a romantic
sentiment, which in its own nature, like
all sentiments, is capricious and evanescent.
It can give no security to
marriage, for it can neither control the
senses nor be controlled by reason.
Suppose it as pure and as lofty as that
of the fabled knight of chivalry for his
"ladie fair," to whom he devotes his
sword and worships as a distant star
pure and serene in the heavens above
him, it cannot survive possession, and
never does and never can exist between
husband and wife. The reason why
love matches are so seldom happy is,
that they are formed with the expectation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span>
that the chivalric and romantic love
of the lovers will survive in the spouses.
But this is never the case, and never
should be; for it is incompatible with
the duties of life. The love that makes
marriage blessed and is its true basis
must indeed be free from coercion; but,
while unconstrained by power or external
force, it must be constrained by
duty and subject to laws. It must be a
love that it depends on one's own will
to give or to withhold.</p>

<p>Marriage requires the free assent of
the parties; and when that free assent
is refused by either party, there is no
marriage, and we are aware of no law of
church or state that treats it as a marriage,
at least of any professedly Christian
state. That the assent, when once
given by the parties competent and free
to give or withhold it, should be held
to be irrevocable, is no hardship. The
parties understand and intend&mdash;nay, desire&mdash;the
contract in forming it to be
during their natural life, or so long as
both continue to live. The nature of
the contract, the purposes for which it
is entered into, require that it should
be indissoluble, save by death only; and
this, too, even without taking into the
account its sacramental character. In
extreme cases the law does not oblige
the parties to live together, and grants
a divorce <i>a mensa et toro</i>; but the Christian
law allows never a divorce <i>a vinculo</i>;
for the end of marriage is not
primarily nor chiefly the happiness of
the husband and wife, but the preservation
of purity, the founding of the
family, and the rearing and training of
children, on which depend the continuance
of the race and the existence of
society. Even if the sentimental love
be wanting, with good-will on each side
and a diligent study of each to perform
the duties of their state, which it depends
on each to have and to do, and
which neither is free to neglect, the little
repugnances and incompatibilities of
temper may be easily got over, a solid
friendship spring up, and much genuine
happiness after all be enjoyed. There
may not be much romance; but romance
and romantic love end always with marriage,
and never survive, and ought not
to be expected to survive, the "honeymoon."
But happily, what is better for
this work-day world, duty may take its
place.</p>

<p>Mr. Sargent is mistaken in saying in
his notes that the church does not regard
marriage between Protestants as
indissoluble. The case he cites is not
in point; for the marriage he supposes
was dissolved was no valid marriage in
Brazil, in consequence of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">disparitas
cultus</i>, which, where the discipline of the
Council of Trent is in force, is an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">impedimentum
dirimens</i>. So also is he
mistaken in his assertion that "up to
the time of Charlemagne ... concubinage
and polygamy were common among
Christians, and countenanced by the
church." The church has never countenanced
either; and if either has ever
been practised by Christians, it has been
only in violation of her express laws.
In point of fact, at no time has either
been common; but some of the Merovingian
kings wished to continue, after
professing to be Christians, the old
practice by the pagan German princes
and higher nobles of polygamy, and the
church, no doubt, had great difficulty
in forcing them to conform to the Christian
law. But it, as concubinage, was
in the eyes of the church always illicit
and sinful. On this subject the law
or discipline of the church has never
changed. The poet is not well qualified
to speak of Catholic or Christian subjects.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">The Pastor and his People; or,
The Word of God and the Flock
of Christ.</span> By Rev. Thomas J.
Potter. Dublin: James Duffy. New-York:
Catholic Publication Society.
1869. Pp. 337.</p>

<p>Father Potter has written this volume
to give pastors some practical hints in
regard to the instruction of their people.
The book is really the second volume
of a work published some years since,
under the title of <i>Sacred Eloquence;
or, The Theory and Practice of Preaching</i>.
That work set forth the great
theoretical principles of pulpit oratory;
this volume reduces those principles to
practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span></p>

<p>The contents of the volume are arranged
under three general heads:
Holiday Preaching, Familiar Instruction,
and Delivery. In the first of
these divisions we find minute instruction
concerning the material that should
be used in what is known as the "set
sermon." Not merely for sermons that
are preached on holidays though, but
for every occasion on which a formal
discourse is suitable. A chapter in this
portion of the work is well devoted to
a defence of these elaborate sermons.
Not that such preaching will be the
most useful or the most expedient, as a
general rule; but simply this, that there
are occasions on which the faithful have
a right to expect a carefully prepared
sermon. These are called set sermons,
because they are composed in conformity
with the fixed rules of oratory. They
suppose a chaste and elevated style; and,
more than this, they suppose even that
the subject should be treated grandly.
At such a time the preacher, by the
dignity of his manner, forces us to recognize
him as truly the "ambassador
of Christ." We feel that the divine
word is treated, as it deserves to be,
with the same respect as the body of
Christ. But it is true that sermons
such as these can only be preached on
rare occasions, because they are expected
to accomplish extraordinary results.
Their frequent repetition would destroy
the very effect that they are intended
to produce. The people, habituated to
these stirring appeals, would cease to
be moved by them, until at length it
would be impossible to rouse them even
by the most fervent and skilfully planned
discourse.</p>

<p>Father Potter does not give too prominent
a place to this elevated and polished
form of preaching. By far the
largest portion of his work is taken up
with the most valuable hints regarding
the familiar instruction of our people.
He tells us that it has been "his unvarying
purpose to throw out substantial
ideas, to suggest leading thoughts, and
to indicate lines of study." Nowhere
is this object accomplished more completely
than in the section of the work
which explains the nature and excellence
of "Familiar Instruction." No
part of the book has pleased us more
than this. Simple, clear, suggestive,
and practical in its suggestions, the
zealous pastor will scarcely rise from
reading the chapters on the Homily, on
the Commandments, on the Sacrament,
and on Prayer, without feeling a renewed
desire to teach these elementary
though essential truths which the Catholic
people of a missionary country do
not know, or at least only know in an
extremely vague and indefinite way.</p>

Almanac for the United States
for the Year of Our Lord 1870.</span>
New York: The Catholic Publication

<p>An almanac for the family has long
been an imperious American necessity.
Judging from the success of the Catholic
Publication Society's Almanac for
the year now drawing to an end, a Catholic
almanac was much needed and
greatly desired by our Catholic population
throughout the United States,
and that it should have met with a

we remember that, in addition to all
the useful information furnished by
all well-prepared almanacs, <i>The Catholic
Family Almanac</i> provided agreeable,
edifying, and instructive literary
matter profusely and admirably illustrated
with superior engravings.</p>

<p>In size, amount of matter, illustrations,

decided improvement upon its predecessor,

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">The Life of Christopher Columbus.</span>
From authentic Spanish and
Italian Documents. Compiled from
the French of Rosselly de Lorgnes.
By I. I. Barry, M.D. Boston: P.
Donahoe. 1869.</p>

<p>The translator or compiler of this
work states in his preface that he has
had to condense the matter of some
pages into almost as many lines. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span>
feel compelled to add that neither history
nor literature would have suffered
if he had gone on condensing indefinitely,
even if, in the process, the book had
been compressed to the vanishing point.
Rosselly de Lorgnes, a veteran writer,
the author of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Christ devant le
Siècle</i>, and other works well known in
Europe, is entitled to all respect and
honor for his sincere and enthusiastic
vindication of the memory of Columbus,
and of his claims to veneration
as a man of saintly character, over and
above all his other well-known merits;
but his work, in two volumes of nearly
six hundred pages each, independently
of other objections to it, sadly wants
brevity and method.</p>

<p>The truth is that, notwithstanding the
praiseworthy efforts of M. De Lorgnes,
and of various authors who have preceded
and followed him in this field,
the life of Columbus is yet to be written.
More than that, it can only be
well written in Spain and with Spanish
materials. When that country has a
historian who is not afraid of telling the
truth about the king of Spain who was
the husband of the noble Isabella of
Castile, and will use without fear or
favor the writings of Columbus himself&mdash;for,
after all, such a great soul is
his own best interpreter&mdash;we shall have
a life of Columbus, and not until then.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">The Improvisatore. The Two Baronesses.</span>
Romances by Hans Christian
Andersen. New York: Hurd
&amp; Houghton.</p>

<p>These two volumes, from the fascinating
pen of the great Danish novelist,
we recognize as old friends in new garments,
and hasten to bid them welcome.</p>

<p>Andersen, who charms the little ones
with the beauty and naturalness of his
fairy tales, is equally a favorite with
children of a larger growth.</p>

<p>His powers of description are surpassed
by few writers in any language,
and the places he has visited, Rome,
Naples, Vesuvius, Venice, Copenhagen,
with the islands nestling about Denmark,
stand before the reader in living
colors, glowing with light and truth.
One feels that these graphic representations
are not drawn from a highly-wrought
imagination, but that they are
living realities. The narratives of the
ascent of Vesuvius, the <i>Infiorata</i>, the
first impressions of Venice, are wonderful
samples of this power of delineation.</p>

<p>High-toned morals and an utter freedom
from maudlin sentimentality mark
both these volumes; the tales are told
with vigor, and the interest sustained to
the end.</p>

<p>The <i>Improvisatore</i>, who is born
and passes most of his years in Italy,
tells his own story, and claims, as do
most of the characters introduced, to
belong to the Catholic Church; but we
think a true Catholic would detect the
fact that the kind-hearted, genial man
who wrote the tale had not the happiness
of being in the faith: though there is
nothing harsh or unkind, or perhaps
no intentional injustice, toward the
church, yet there is here and there the
slight touch of sarcasm concerning
what the writer supposes to be a dogma
of the faith, or a hit at some local
Catholic custom, which would not have
come from the pen of a loyal son of our
holy Mother.</p>

<p>The scene of <i>The Two Baronesses</i> is
laid in Denmark, and though not so captivating
as the <i>Improvisatore</i>, the tale is
well told, and hangs on the lovely motto
"that there is an invisible thread in
every person's life which shows that
it belongs to God."</p>

<p>The binding of these volumes is in
excellent taste, and the print clear,

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Through Night to Light</span>: A Novel.
By Friedrich Spielhagen. New
York: Leypoldt &amp; Holt.</p>

<p>Were one of our first American
novelists to put forth such a story as
the above, it would be hissed by the
voice of public opinion; but it seems
we may receive from the German, and
call poetic, ideal, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">spirituelle</i>, what
would be considered coarse and immoral
even in a penny journal.</p>

<p>We will give a specimen of the author's
philosophy. Speaking of a married
woman who had been in more
cases than one unfaithful to her marriage
relations, the author says,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Have you not paid the penalty of the
wrong, if wrong it was to follow the impulse
of a free heart? Is it reasonable to sacrifice
the wife to a rigorous moral law which
the husband does not consider binding?
Who has made that unwise law? Not I,
not you." (He might have added <em>only</em> Almighty
God.) "Why, then, should you
obey it? I tell you the day of freedom
which is now dawning will blow all such
self-imposed laws to the winds, and with
them all the ordinances devised by a dark,
monkish disposition to fetter nature and
torment hearts."</p></blockquote>

<p>To the corrupting influence of this
style of literature we owe such scenes
as the one which recently in this city
shocked the public mind. The title of
this book is a misnomer. It should
be, not <i>Through Night to Light</i>, but
<i>Through Light to Night</i>.</p>

1870.</p>

<p>The title of this volume is somewhat
suggestive of its contents. In it the
author graphically describes the various
dangers and temptations to which the
recently-arrived female emigrant is exposed,
and also pays a well-merited tribute
to the many virtues that distinguish
the vast majority of Irish girls in America;
virtues to which, in the face of
many troubles and vexations, they have
so heroically adhered.</p>

Mary</span>, (Alacoque.) With some Account
of the Devotion to the Sacred

<p>This life of a remarkable person, the
chief instrument of establishing that
devotion to the Sacred Heart so dear to
all devout Catholics, which was one of
the most efficacious weapons against the
odious heresy of Jansenism, is much
superior to any heretofore published.
We are glad to see certain extravagant
statements concerning the treatment
of the saint in the convents of her
order, which were discreditable to them

and less frequent, a judicious one.
The book is published in elegant style,

<p class="center">SECOND ARTICLE.</p>


<p>The Abbé Martin divides his treatise
into nine books, each of which
he subdivides into several chapters.
In the first book he labors to prove
that Protestantism is imperishable; in
the second, he discusses the Protestant
revival and its effects; in the third, he
treats of the Protestant propaganda,
or Protestant missions and their results;
in the fourth, of the wealth and
well-being of Protestant as compared
with Catholic nations; in the fifth, of
Catholic and Protestant tolerance and
intolerance; in the sixth, of liberty
and its influence on the future of Protestantism;
in the seventh, of religious
liberty in its relations with Protestantism;
in the eighth, of the decline
of Catholic nations and governments,
and the progressive march of Protestant
nations and governments; and in
the ninth and last, of the union or alliance
of Protestantism with the revolution,
or the revolutionary spirit so
active in nearly all modern society.</p>

<p>In our former article we reviewed
the subjects treated in the first, second,
and part of the third books,
and reserved for our present article
two of the three causes the author assigns
for the partial success of Protestant
missions in old Catholic nations,
namely, the <i>prestige</i> which Protestant
nations enjoy of surpassing
Catholic nations in wealth and well-being,
and of having founded and
sustained civil and religious liberty.
But these two causes, though treated
by the author in his third book, really
embrace the subject of the remaining
six books. We cannot say that the
author has so digested and arranged
his ample materials as to avoid repetitions,
or so as to bring all that
belongs to the same topic under one
head; but treats it partly under one
head and partly under another. A
glance at the titles of the last six
books will satisfy the reader as well as
the reviewer, that the subjects treated
fall under two general heads. First,
civil and religious liberty; second,
the comparative wealth and well-being
of Catholic and Protestant nations;
and under these two heads we shall
arrange our summary of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>
views of the author, and our own
comments. We begin with the last.</p>

<p>I. The author assigns, as we have
seen, as one of the causes of the success
of Protestant missions in old
Catholic nations, the <i>prestige</i> which
Protestant nations enjoy of surpassing
Catholic nations in material wealth
and well-being. That this <i>prestige</i>
attaches to Protestant nations is a fact
not to be disputed; but is it well
founded? The author seems to concede
that it is, and maintains that
"there is in Protestant nations and
Protestant individuals a superior aptitude
and a greater eagerness and tenacity
in the pursuit and acquisition
of the goods of this world" than there
is in Catholic nations and individuals.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Place," he says, "Catholics and Protestants
side by side on the same territory,
in conditions perfectly equal, and leave each
to act under the influence of their respective
principles, and not a half-century will elapse
before the Protestants will have taken in the
material order a marked superiority. The
Protestants will have the finest vineyards, the
best cultivated fields, the greenest meadows,
the most elegant mansions, and the freshest
shade. They will have almost the monopoly
of industry, commerce, large capital, the
bourse, the bank, money at interest, and
own all the mills and factories, if any there
are. If you doubt it, consult Alsace and
Strasburg, Nimes, Montpellier, the environs
of Bourdeaux, the mixed Swiss cantons,
and the conquests the American Union has
made of the Spaniards of Mexico....
Wherever Protestants plant themselves, they
are able to attain a preponderating influence
in all civil affairs. With only a fourth of the
population they will hold three fourths of
the public offices, have the majority in the
municipal council, the mayor of the commune,
if not the adjunct, the highest grades
in the national guard, the member of the
conseil-général, the deputy, sometimes the
senator, and the most widely circulating
journal of the district, daily filled with eulogiums
on their merit.</p>

<p>"It is the same on a large scale among
nations. Who knows not that there are more
wealth, more well-being, more comfort, eleganter
houses, softer couches, more sugar
and coffee, in England, Scotland, Holland,
Prussia, at Zurich, Berne, Geneva, New
York, than in Spain, Portugal, Austria, at
Rome or Rio Janeiro?</p>

<p>"It would seem that there is a sort of
<i>preëstablished harmony</i> between Protestantism
and the earth, that they know and attract
each other. Where the earth is most smiling
and wears the richest decorations, it
naturally becomes Protestant. In Switzerland,
the richest and most fertile districts are
Protestant, the rugged and barren are Catholic.
The former, with their facile enjoyments,
seem to invite to very forgetfulness
of heaven; the latter only to raise and fix the
affections above the earth, and can be made
or become Protestant possessions only by
force or violence." (Pp. 186-188.)</p></blockquote>

<p>We are not prepared to make quite
so large concessions. Protestants do
not monopolize all the pleasant, rich,
and fertile spots of the earth. The
fact may be true of Switzerland, but
it is not true of the Italian peninsula
nor of the Iberian, in which are the
richest and most fertile districts of
Europe; nor, in point of climate, soil,
and productions, does Protestant Germany
surpass Catholic Germany.
The <i>preëstablished harmony</i> alleged
has no foundation in fact, and we
have heard the contrary more than
once maintained by well-informed
Catholic prelates. Nor are we prepared
to concede that, if you speak
of the whole population, there is
more comfort and well-being in Protestant
than in Catholic nations. The
peasantry of Italy, before the late
political changes, had as much comfort
and well-being as the peasantry
of Denmark, Sweden, or Norway, or
even Great Britain and Holland, and
the peasantry of Austria proper are in
the same respects better off than those
of Prussia or Hanover. In no countries
in the world is there to be found
such squalid wretchedness as in those
under the British crown, and governed
by the head of the Protestant
church. There may be more wealth
in Great Britain than in France, but
there is also more and far deeper
poverty. France, by a war with all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span>
Europe, was prostrated in 1815; her
capital was held by foreign invaders,
and she was forced to pay millions
by way of indemnification to the invaders,
and to support an allied army
cantoned on her territory to compel
her to keep the peace; and yet she
met her extraordinary expenses, greatly
reduced her national debt, reasserted
her freedom of action and her position
as a great European power, and
extended her territory by the conquest
of Algiers, in less than fifteen
years, under the restoration and under
a Catholic government. No nation
under a Protestant government
can be named that has ever carried
so heavy a burden so easily, or done
so much in so short a time to lighten
it. We have seen nothing like it in
England, the model Protestant nation.
Since 1830, France has ceased
to be a Catholic nation, under a Catholic
government, and has to a great
extent adopted the British industrial
and commercial system. She has
shown nothing since of that marvellous
recuperative energy she showed
under the Bourbons. She is burdened
now with a constantly increasing
national debt, her people are taxed
for national and municipal expenses
to the last cent they can bear, and
there can be no doubt that she is relatively
poorer and weaker to-day
than she was during the last years of
the Restoration.</p>

<p>Our experience in this country
does not warrant the concessions of
the author. Placed side by side and
in equal conditions with Protestants,
Catholics have shown themselves in
no sense inferior to Protestants in
their aptitude to get on in the world.
Their progress here in wealth, in comfort,
and ease has been relatively
greater than that of the older Protestant
population; for they started from
an inferior worldly position, and with
far inferior means. To be convinced
of it, we need but look at the schools
and colleges they have founded, at
the costly and splendid churches they
have erected, and at the large sums
they have contributed for the support
of Catholic charities and their friends
in Ireland and other countries, from
which the majority of them have emigrated.
With an intense Protestant
prejudice against them, they have, in
a very few years, risen in the social
scale, gained a respectable standing
in the American community, carried
away the first prizes in law and medicine,
and secured their full share of
public offices both civil and military.</p>

<p>The United States have proved
themselves too powerful for the Mexicans,
we concede, and they well
might do so, with vastly greater resources
and a population three times
as large. The Mexicans are only
about one in nine of pure Spanish
blood; the rest are pure-blooded Indians,
or a mixed race of whites and
Indians, and of Indians and negroes.
Yet if our officers who served in the
Mexican war may be believed, braver,
hardier, more enduring or energetic
soldiers than the Mexicans
cannot easily be found. The feebleness
of Mexico is not due to her Catholicity,
but to her lack of it; to her
mad attempts to establish and maintain
a republican form of government,
for which her previous training, manners,
and habits wholly unfitted her.
Had she, on gaining her independence
of Spain, established monarchical
institutions, and not been influenced
by our example and intrigues, and
the insane theories of European revolutionists,
she would not have fallen
below her non-Catholic neighbor.
No Protestant people surpass in bravery,
boldness, enterprise, energy, national
or individual, the Spaniards of
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries,
and they were far better Catholics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span>
then than they or Spanish-Americans
are now.</p>

<p>There is an important fact too often
lost sight of in discussing the alleged
superior aptitude of Protestants in
relation to this world. We find nowhere
braver soldiers, bolder sailors,
more enterprising merchants, or more
ingenious workmen than were the
Venetians, the Genoese, the Florentines,
and the Portuguese when in
their best estate. A Portuguese sailor
opened the way by the Cape of
Good Hope to India; a Genoese
discovered this western continent,
which bears an Italian name; an
Italian, also, was the discoverer of this
northern half of the American continent;
and it was a Catholic sovereign
who aided the Anglo-American
colonies to assert their independence.
Yet Portugal, Venice, Genoa, Florence,
when they were greatest, were
Catholic, and their decline in later
times is not owing to their Catholicity;
for they were Catholic all the time
that they were rising from their feeble
beginnings, and at the period of their
greatest power and splendor, more
bigotedly so, as our liberals would
say, than they are now; and what
did not hinder their rise and growth
could not be the cause of their decline.
They have declined through
other causes, and causes well known
to the student of the rise and fall of
nations.</p>

<p>It is, no doubt, true that in France,
Belgium, and Italy, and perhaps in
other old Catholic states, Catholics,
even where they are the immense
majority, permit the public offices to
be filled, and themselves to be ruled
by Protestants, Jews, infidels, and
such secularized Catholics as hold the
state should govern the church; and
we have often felt not a little indignant
to find it so; but modern society
in all Catholic states recedes from
the old aristocratic constitution of
Europe, and tends to democracy; and
democracy, as our American experience
proves, elevates to power not
the best men in the community, but
often the worst, the least scrupulous,
the most intriguing, selfish, and ambitious.
The fact may also be explained
by the false political education
which the Catholic populations have
received. Under Gallicanism they
are not instructed to regard Catholicity
as <em>catholic</em>, and are taught to
look upon politics as exempted from
the law of God as defined by the
church. For them religion and politics
are wholly disconnected, have no
necessary relation one to the other,
rest not on a common principle. Their
political education relegates religion
to private and domestic life, to the
personal and domestic virtues, and
has nothing to say in public affairs.
Why then should not Protestants, Jews,
infidels, or merely nominal Catholics,
fill the public offices, and take the
management of public affairs?</p>

<p>The French, and other Catholics,
who see and deplore this, having received
the same sort of education,
make the evil worse by laboring not
to bring politics up to Catholicity, but
to bring the church down to the
level of politics, thus lowering the one
without elevating the other. They
assume an attitude toward the government
of distrust, if not of hostility,
and exert their influence to Jacobinize
the church instead of destroying her,
as the revolution would do if it could.
Practically, they are only Catholic
instead of infidel Jacobins; and whatever
their personal hopes and intentions,
simply play into the hands of
the revolution. It is not the church
that needs liberalizing, but the state
that needs Catholicizing. The evil,
the political imbecility of Catholics in
these old Catholic nations, results from
the divorce of politics from religion,
or the withdrawal of the political order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>
from its proper subordination and
subserviency to the spiritual. It is
the fruit of the so-called "Gallican
liberties," and the remedy is not in the
alliance of the church either with democracy
or with monarchy, with Jacobinism
or with absolutism; but in
bringing the faithful to understand
that the Catholic religion is <em>catholic</em>,
and has the right from God to govern
them alike in their public relations
and in their private and personal relations;
in their public and official life,
and in their private and domestic
life.</p>

<p>In all these old nations the predominant
religion is Christian, but the
politics are pagan; and Protestants
take the lead in political affairs because
they have succeeded in paganizing
their own religion, and in eliminating
all antagonism between it and
their politics; while the Catholics are
politically inefficient because, owing to
the paganism of the state, they have
not been able to Christianize their
politics and bring them into harmony
with their religion. They themselves
sympathize politically with Protestants,
but are less efficient than they,
because more or less restrained by
their religion. Eliminate, by Christianizing
politics, all antagonism between
politics and religion, which now
renders Catholics politically indifferent
or imbecile, and enable them to
act with a united instead of a divided
mind, and they will show even a
greater aptitude for the affairs of this
world than Protestants, because they
will act from a higher plane, from
profounder and more luminous principles,
and with the energy and tenacity
of an ever-present and living faith,
instead of interest or expediency.
But how can they do so when politics
in every state in Europe are divorced
from Catholic principle, are pagan,
and at war with Christianity, and to
take part in them they must sacrifice
their religion and give up heaven for
earth?</p>

<p>It is not Catholicity that renders
the Catholics of old Catholic nations
politically imbecile, and that permits
a miserable minority of Protestants,
Jews, and infidels to control the state,
but the lack of it; not the fact that
they are, but that they are not, thoroughly
Catholic. It is the paganism
that rules in the state, and is the
basis of modern politics, that renders
them timid and inefficient. In all
Protestant nations religion itself is paganized,
and there is as little conflict
between religion and politics as there
was in old pagan Greece or Rome.
They are torn, distracted, weakened
by no internal conflict between the
two powers; for the first act of the
Reformation was to subject the spiritual
order to the secular. Hence,
they can act politically with undivided
mind and undivided strength and
energy. They have conformed their
religion to their politics. But in all
Catholic nations the governments,
and, therefore, politics are pagan, and
really, if not avowedly, at war with
their religion that remains Christian.
Those nations are therefore distracted,
divided, weakened by the irrepressible
antagonism between pagan politics
supported by the secular authorities,
and the Christian religion sustained
only by the church, crippled by being
denied her freedom.</p>

<p>It is easy now to understand why
Protestant missions in old Catholic
nations should not be wholly barren
of results. They are backed by the
whole weight of Protestant nations,
governments and people; they are aided
by the real sympathies and tendencies
of the so-called Catholic governments
and the pagan politics of Catholics
themselves. What is surprising
is, that their successes are no greater.
It is no mean proof of the life
and power of the church, and of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span>
divine assistance, that she is able to
retain so strong a hold as she does on
so large a portion of the old Catholic
populations, and to bear up against so
many and such powerful enemies, enemies
within as well as without the
fortress.</p>

<p>The explanation offered by the author
of the facts he concedes does not
wholly satisfy us. He attributes them
to the influence of the Catholic faith
in inducing a renunciation of the
world, producing in the minds and
hearts of the faithful indifference to
it, and a disposition to live only for
piety and heaven.</p>

<p>That Catholicity has, and was designed
to have this tendency, of course,
we ourselves maintain; but we have
studied the Gospel and Providence as
manifested in human affairs to little
effect if the renunciation of the world
for Christ's sake is not the very way
to secure it. They who give up all
for Christ have even in this world the
promise of a hundred-fold, and in the
world to come life everlasting. "Seek
first the kingdom of God and his justice,
and <em>all these</em> things shall be added
unto you." The true principle,
both of political and domestic economy,
is self-denial, renunciation. He
who seeks the world and lives for it,
shall lose it, since in so doing he violates
the divine order, and takes as his
end what at best is only a means. Other
things being equal, then, we should
expect a truly Catholic people to surpass
in wealth and well-being, as in
industry and virtue, a heathen, an infidel,
or a Protestant people. Certainly,
the inferiority of Catholic nations
in material wealth and well-being is
no argument against Catholicity; but
it is, in our judgment, a proof that its
government and people are not truly
Catholic. We do not admit, to the
extent the author does, the alleged
superiority of Protestant nations, even
as to the material goods of this life;
but as far as they can claim any superiority
over Catholic nations in this
respect, we attribute it to what we
have called paganism in politics, or
to the fact that in no Catholic nation
since the revival of pagan literature
in the fifteenth century have politics
been elevated to the Catholic standard
and made to harmonize with the
Christian religion.</p>

<p>The author concedes, also, that,
during the last century and the present,
Catholic nations have been
steadily declining, and Protestant nations
advancing. At the opening of
the seventeenth century, the Catholic
were the great and leading nations
of the world. Italy, it is true, had
begun to decline; Spain had attained
its zenith; but the German empire was
still the first power in Europe. France
was succeeding to the rank of Spain,
and Poland was regarded as the barrier
of Catholicity against the North
and the East, while England was
weakened by revolution at home.
Prussia was only a principality,
though soon to become a kingdom,
and the United States did not exist.
At present, England is the undisputed
mistress of the ocean, is a great Asiatic
and a great American power,
weighing heavily on continental Europe;
Prussia is absorbing all Germany.
The United States have the
mastership of the new world, and are
exerting a terrible pressure on the old;
while, on the other hand, Portugal
has become virtually a colony of
England; Spain has lost a world, ceased
to be a great power, and is worse
than nothing to the Catholic cause;
Poland is divided among her neighbors,
and annihilated; Austria is expelled
from Germany, and threatened
with the fate of Poland; Italy, at war
with the pope, throws her weight on the
side of the Protestant nations. Russia
and the new Greek empire that is to
be are not Protestant; but, as schismatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span>
powers, will sustain the Protestant
policy as against Catholicity.
France, if she has not declined, has
abandoned her mission as a great Catholic
power, and is as little to be
counted on to resist Anglo-Saxon ascendency
as Russia or the revived
Greek empire.</p>

<p>The excellent abbé, however, admonishes
us that this decline on the
one side, and growth and preponderance
on the other, is political, not religious;
and indicates no decline in
Catholicity, or progress of Protestantism.
The Latin races, except in
France, have declined; but the
church has gained more members
than she has lost. Only the Anglo-Saxon
race, the bulwark of Protestantism,
has advanced. Denmark,
Sweden, and Holland, considerable
Protestant powers at the opening of
the seventeenth century, have lost
their political importance. Holland
is half Catholic, and the Dutch Catholics
are not less devoted to the
church, less tenacious of their rights,
nor less politically active and energetic
than the Catholics of Ireland,
and even less distracted by questions
of national relief or national independence.</p>

<p>One third of the population of
Prussia is Catholic, and a larger proportion
will be if she, as is likely, absorbs
Southern Germany. Not much
reliance is to be placed on Prussia as
a Protestant power. The future belongs
to the Anglo-Saxon race&mdash;England
and the United States&mdash;to be
disputed only by schismatic Russia
and the new schismatic Greek empire
in the process of formation. This relieves
the gloom of the picture a little.</p>

<p>But while we agree with the author
that Britain and our own country are
the principal supports of Protestantism
and of Protestant politics, unless
we except France, usually reckoned
as a Catholic power, we do not believe
that even the United States and
Britain, acting in concert, are so formidable,
in an anti-Catholic sense,
as he represents them. The British
crown has more Catholic than Protestant
subjects, and its Catholic subjects
are for the most part enfranchised,
and beginning to exert a powerful
and constantly increasing influence
on the policy of the government.
England is obliged to count with Ireland,
not only as to Irish interests in
Ireland, but, to some extent, as to
Catholic interests throughout the empire.
The Catholic population in the
United States is rapidly growing in
numbers, education, wealth, and influence,
and is already too large to
be oppressed with impunity, and large
enough, when not misled by foreign
passions and interests, to prevent the
government from adopting a decidedly
anti-Catholic policy either at
home or abroad. Were the United
States even to absorb the Catholic
states on this continent, it would be
advantageous, not detrimental, to Catholic
interests. Mexican and Cuban,
as well as Central and South American
Catholics would gain much by being
annexed to the Union, and brought
under the direct action of the ecclesiastical
authority, as are the Catholics
of the United States. We see nothing
reassuring, we own, to the so-called
Latin races in the growth and
preponderance of the Anglo-Saxon
nations, but not much that is promising
to Protestantism; for we cannot
believe that Christianity has failed,
or that the future of society belongs
to paganism.</p>

<p>The abbé does not attribute the
decline of the Latin races to any religious
cause, but finds its explanation&mdash;1.
In the law of growth and
decay, to which nations as individuals
are subjected; 2. In climate&mdash;the
southern climate tends to soften and
enervate, the northern to harden and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span>
invigorate; 3. In geographical position;
4. In difference of temperaments;
5. Political constitutions; and
6. In accidental or providential causes,
not to be foreseen and guarded
against&mdash;the presence or absence of
a great man, the defeat of a well-devised,
or the success of a blundering
policy, the gain of a battle that should
have been lost, or the loss of a battle
that should have been gained, etc.
(Pp. 497-508.)</p>

<p>Most of these causes we examined
and disposed of, some time ago, in
a review of Professor Draper's works.
The first and second we do not count.
We do not believe that nations, like
individuals, are subject to the law of
growth, maturity, old age, and death.
There are no facts or analogies from
which such a law can be adduced,
and a Catholic nation, if truly Catholic,
has in its religion a fountain of
perennial youth. Whatever disasters
befall a Catholic nation, if not absorbed
by another, it has always in
itself a recuperative power. We believe
just as little in the influence of
climate as one of the causes of the
decline of the Latin nations. The
climate under which they have declined
is the same under which they
grew up and became the preponderating
races. The extreme heat within
the tropics is less unfavorable to
mind or body than the extreme cold
of the Arctic regions. The Latin races
have lived both in their growth and
in their decline under the finest,
mildest, and healthiest climate within
the temperate zone. The ablest men,
as scholars, artists, statesmen, and generals,
of France have belonged to her
southern departments; and we found
in our recent civil war that the men
from the extreme Southern States,
in their physical qualities, bravery,
activity and vigor of body, and power
of endurance, were not at all inferior
to the men of the more Northern
States. In fact, they could bear
more fatigue, and suffer more privations,
with less demoralization than
the Northern man. We make just as
little account of difference of temperament.
The southern nations, with
the same temperament, were once the
preponderating nations of Europe, and
the French are in no respect inferior
to the English, and in many things
superior. Spain in the sixteenth century
not only surpassed what England
then was, but even what she now is;
and there was a time when it was said
of Portugal, the sun never sets on her
empire. We do not believe much in
differences of race; for God hath made
all nations of one blood.</p>

<p>Geographical position counts for
something. The nations that have
ports only on the Mediterranean, or
access to the ocean only through that
sea, have been unfavorably affected
by the discovery of the passage to
India by the Cape of Good Hope,
and of this western continent in the
fifteenth century. These maritime
discoveries, which have changed the
routes of commerce as well as the
character of commerce itself, have
given the advantage to the nations
that open on the Atlantic, and sufficiently
account for the decline of the
Italian republics. The canal across the
Isthmus of Suez, just opened, will do
something, no doubt, to revive the commerce
of the Mediterranean, but cannot
restore it, because the Indian trade
is not now of the same relative importance
that it was formerly. The
American trade comes in for its share,
rivals and even exceeds it, and this
trade, whether a ship-canal be or be
not opened across the Isthmus of
Darien, will be chiefly in the hands
of the United States and the western
nations of Europe, for their geographical
position enables them to command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span>
it. The insular position of Great
Britain has also given her some advantages.</p>

<p>Political constitutions also count for
something; but in the beginning of
the seventeenth century, the political
constitutions of the several European
states, except the Italian republics,
the Swiss Cantons, and the United
Netherlands, were essentially the same,
that is, Roman monarchy engrafted on
feudalism. Monarchy was as absolute
in England under the Tudors and the
Stuarts as it ever was in France or
Spain, and the other estates counted
for no more in her than in them. The
Protestant states of Germany were
not more popular in their constitution
than the Catholic states, and Austria
has never been so despotic as Prussia.
We cannot, however, attribute much
to this cause; for why have the Latin
states been less successful in developing
and ameliorating their political
constitution than the Anglo-Saxon, if
we assume that they have not been?</p>

<p>The accidental or providential causes,
in the author's sense, being measurable
by no rule and subject to no
known law, cannot be very well discussed,
and we are not inclined to attach
much importance to them. A
nation is already declining, or passed
its zenith, if the loss of a single battle
can ruin it; and on its ascending
course, if the winning of one can secure
it a permanent ascendency. Napoleon
won many important battles,
and yet he died a prisoner on the barren
rock of St. Helena. A victory
by Pompey at Pharsalia, or by Brutus
and Cassius at Philippi, could not
have restored the patrician republic
or changed the fate of Rome. The
republic was lost before Cæsar crossed
the Rubicon. Great men play an
important part, no doubt; but a nation
that can be saved by the presence of
a great man is in no serious danger,
or that could be lost by his absence
cannot be saved by his presence. Individuals
count for less than hero-worshippers
commonly imagine. The
race is not to the swift, nor the battle
to the strong.</p>

<p>Except in the loss of the commercial
supremacy of the Italian republics
by the maritime discoveries of the
fifteenth century, we regard, though
not in the sense of Protestants, the
chief causes of the decline of the Latin
nations as religious, and the ascendency
of Protestant nations as,
in the main, the counterpart of the
decline of Catholic nations. The
Catholic nations have declined, not
because they have been Catholic, but
because they and their governments
have not been truly Catholic. Something,
indeed, is due to the fact that
England completed her revolution a
hundred years before that of the Latin
nations began. She had passed
through her principal internal struggles,
established the basis of her constitution,
settled her dynasty, and
was in a position when the Latin revolutions
broke out to turn them to
her own advantage. She used the
madness of French Jacobinism, and
the o'er-vaulting ambition of the first
Napoleon. Being earlier too, the
English revolution was less democratic
than that of the Latin nations,
and did not so essentially weaken the
nation by eliminating the aristocratic
element. England is only just now
entering upon the fearful struggle between
aristocracy and democracy, and
it is very possible that she will lose
her ascendency before she gets through
it. Still we find the principal cause of
the deterioration of Catholic nations
connected, at least, with religion.</p>

<p>Both the nations that became Protestant
and those that remained Catholic
were affected by the revival of
Greek and Roman paganism in the
fifteenth century. The northern nations,
adopting it in politics, speedily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>
conformed their religion to it, subjected
the spiritual to the secular,
abandoned the church, made themselves
Protestant, and harmonized
their interior national life. The
southern nations adhered to the church,
for there were in them too many
enlightened, earnest-minded, and devout
Catholics to permit them to
break wholly with the successor of
Peter; but their governments, statesmen,
and scholars, artists and upper
classes, adopted pagan politics, literature,
art, and manners, and thus created
an antagonism between their religion
and their whole secular life,
which greatly impaired the influence
of the church, and led to a fearful
corruption of politics, manners, and
morals. The cause of the deterioration
of these nations is precisely in
this antagonism, intensified by the
so-called <i>Renaissance</i>, and which has
continued, down to the present time,
and will, most likely, continue yet
longer.</p>

<p>The Council of Trent did something
to check the evil, but could not eradicate
it; for its cause was not in the
church, nor in the abuses of ecclesiastical
discipline or administration, but
in the secular order, in which the secular
powers would suffer no radical
reforms either in facts or principles.
They were willing the church should
reform her own administration, but
would not conform their own to the
principles of which she was the appointed
guardian. They would protect
her against heretical powers; but
only on their own terms, and only so
far as she would consent to be made
or they could use her as an instrument
of their ambition. Charles V.
would protect her only so far as he
could without losing in his military
projects the support of the Protestant
princes of the empire; and when he
wished to force the pope to his terms,
he let loose his fanatical troops under
the Constable Bourbon against Rome,
who imprisoned him and spoiled and
sacked the city for nine months; Philip
II. would also serve the church
and make a war of extermination on
heretics in the Low Countries, but only
in the hope of using her as an instrument
in attaining to the universal
monarchy at which he aimed. Louis
XIV., and after him Napoleon I., attempted
the same. They all thought
they could use her to further their
own ambition; but they failed&mdash;and
failed miserably, shamefully. He to
whom it belongs to give victory or
defeat, who demands disinterested
services, and who will not suffer his
church to be used as an instrument
of earthly ambition, touched them
with his finger, and their strength
failed, they withered as grass, and all
their plans miscarried. It was better
that her avowed enemies should triumph
for a season than that she should
be enslaved by her protectors, or
smothered in the embraces of her
friends. God is a jealous God, and
his glory he will not give to another.</p>

<p>Here we see the cause. Paganism
in the state corrupted the sovereigns,
their courts, and the ruling classes in
morals and manners, enfeebled character,
debased society, in the Catholic
states. The failure, through divine
Providence, of the ambitious and selfish
schemes of such professedly Catholic
sovereigns as Philip II., Louis
XIV., and Napoleon I., reduced the
Latin races to the low estate in which
we now find them, and gave, in the
political, commercial, and industrial
order, the ascendency to Protestant
nations, as a chastisement to both,
and a lesson to Catholics from which
it is to be hoped they will profit. If
the Catholic nations had been truly
Catholic, if the educated and ruling
classes had recognized and defended
the church steadily from the first on
Catholic principles, and unflinchingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[587]</a></span>
maintained her freedom and independence
as the kingdom of God on
earth, representing him who is King
of kings and Lord of lords, these nations
would have retained their preponderance,
the church would have
reformed the morals and manners of
society, and the Protestant nations
would never have existed, or would
have speedily returned to the fold.</p>

<p>Yet we do not despair of these
Latin races; for, though their governments
have betrayed the faith, and
the people have been alienated from
the church by attributing to her the
political faults of their rulers, from
which she and they alike have suffered,
they still retain Catholic tradition,
and have in them large numbers of
men and women, more than enough
to have saved the cities of the plain,
who are true believers, and who know
and practise in sincerity and earnestness
their faith. They have still a recuperative
energy, and may yet re-ascend
the scale they have descended.
The present emperor of the French
believed it possible, and his mission
to recover the Latin races. He attempted
it, and his plan, to human
wisdom, seemed well devised and
practicable. It was to break the alliance
between England and Russia;
to create an independent, confederated,
or united Italy; to divide the Anglo-Saxon
race in the United States,
and to raise up and consolidate a
Latin power in Mexico and Central
America, while he extended the
French power in North Africa, defeated
English and Russian diplomatic
preponderance in the East, opened a
maritime canal across the Isthmus of
Suez, and recovered the commerce
of India for the Mediterranean powers.
By these means he would give
to France the protectorate of the
Latin races, and guard alike against
Anglo-Saxon and Russian preponderance.
But his plan made no account,
or a false account, of the moral
and religious causes of the decline of
Latin races, and sought to elevate them
not as truly Catholic but as temporal
powers, and to use the church for a secular
end, instead of using the secular
power he possessed for a spiritual and
Catholic end. He committed over
again the error of his uncle, Louis
XIV., and Philip II., and has failed, as
he might have foreseen if he had understood
that the church must be served,
if at all, for herself, and that she serves
the secular only when the secular
serves her for her own sake.</p>

<p>The result of Napoleon's policy
has been not to elevate the Latin races
and to bring them to gravitate
around France as the great central
Latin power, but to weaken the power
of the church over them, to strengthen
the antagonism between their faith
and their politics, and to depress
them still more in relation to the Teutonic
and Slavonic races. The emperor
of the French, whether he had
or had not Catholic interests at heart,
has done them great injury. He
began by subordinating the spiritual
to the secular, when he should have
begun by subordinating the secular to
the spiritual. He would then have
secured the divine protection and
assistance, and been invincible. He
has, in reality, only defeated the end
he aimed at, and left the Latin races
in a more deplorable condition than
that in which he found them. As a
Catholic and as a Latin sovereign, he
has not been a success. The Protestant
and schismatical powers have
grown only by the faults and blunders,
the want of submission and fidelity
of the professedly Catholic powers;
not by any means, as they suppose,
by the errors and abuses of the ecclesiastical
administration, nor by any
positive virtue, even for this world, in
their heresy and schism. God, as we
have just said, is a jealous God, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[588]</a></span>
his glory he will not give to another.
The Latin races, so called, when in
power sought not his glory but their
own, and failed. But they may yet
recover their former power and splendor,
if not their commercial preponderance,
by rejecting the subtle paganism
which has enervated them, the
infidel politics they have adopted; by
restoring to the church her full freedom
and independence as the spiritual
order, and by subordinating the
secular to the spiritual order; that is,
by making themselves really and truly
Catholic.</p>

<p>In France there was, at an early
day, an attempt made to reconcile
paganism in politics with Catholicity
in religion, in what is called Gallicanism,
which, however, only served to
systematize the antagonism between
church and state, and to render it all
the more destructive to both. We look
upon Gallicanism, as expressed in the
four articles adopted at the dictation
of the government by the assembly
of the French clergy in 1682, and
which had shown itself all along from
Philip the Fair, the grandson of St.
Louis, which broke out in great violence
with Louis XII., and his <i>petit</i>
council of five cardinals at Pisa, acted
on by the <i>politiques</i> of Henry IV., and
formulated by the great Bossuet under
Louis XIV., as the most formidable
as well as the most subtle enemy
the church has ever had to contend
with.</p>

<p>The essence, the real virus, so to
speak, of Gallicanism is not, as so
many suppose, in the assertion that
the dogmatic definitions of the pope
are not irreformible&mdash;though that is a
grave error, in our judgment&mdash;but in
the assertion of the independence of
the state in face of the spiritual order.
No doubt Bossuet's purpose in drawing
up the four articles was to prevent
the French government from
going farther and carrying away the
kingdom into open heresy and schism;
but the Subtle secularism to which
he gave his sanction, especially as
sure to be practically understood
and applied, is far harder to deal with
than either heresy or schism, and it
seems to us far more embarrassing to
the church. It forbids the Catholic
to be logical, to draw from his Catholic
principles their proper consequences,
or to give them their legitimate
application; takes away from
the defences of faith its outposts, and
reduces them to the bare citadel, and
proves an almost insurmountable obstacle
to the church in her efforts to
reach and subdue the world to the
law of God. It withdraws the secular
order from its rightful subjection
to the spiritual order, and denies that
religion is the supreme law for nations
as well as for individuals, and for
kings as well as for subjects.</p>

<p>The principal fault we find with
the author, as may be gathered from
what we have said, is that he appears
to see in the antagonism between pagan
politics and Christian, or in the
original and inextinguishable dualism
asserted by Gallicanism, no cause of
the deterioration of Catholic nations,
or of the partial success in old Catholic
populations of Protestant missions
in unmaking Catholics, if not
in making Protestants. He seems
to accept the one-sided asceticism
which places the goods of this life in
antagonism with the goods of the
world to come, and, though he does
not avow Gallicanism, originated by
paganism in the state, he does not disavow
it, or appear to be aware that it
has any influence in detaching the
people from the church, by making
them Catholics only on one side of
their minds, and leaving them pagan
on the other.</p>

<p>The enemies of the church understand
this matter far better, and they
look upon a Gallican as being as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[589]</a></span>
good as a Protestant. James I., the
English Solomon, declared himself
ready to accept the church, if allowed
to do it on Gallican principles. Protestants
have very little controversy
with out-and-out Gallicanism. They
feel instinctively that the Catholics who
assert the independence, which means
practically the supremacy, of the secular
order, and bind the pope by
the canons which the church herself
makes, are near enough to them; and
if they are not separated from the
church, it is all the better, because
they can better serve the Protestant
cause in her communion than they
could if out of it. It is the Papal,
not the Gallican church they hate.</p>

<p>We do not agree, if we may be
permitted to say so, with the author
as to the superiority of Protestant
nations, or that they are likely to retain
for any great length of time the superiority
they appear now to have, nor
do we accept, as we have already intimated,
the one-sided asceticism which
supposes any necessary antagonism
between this world and the next.
The antagonism grows out of the
error of placing this world as the end
or supreme good, when it is, in fact,
only a medium. We as Christians
renounce it as the end we live for;
but if we so renounce it, and live only
in Christ for God, who is really our
supreme good, we find this world in
its true place with all its goods; and
a really Catholic nation that holds
the spiritual and eternal supreme,
and subordinates the secular to it,
will have a hundred-fold more of the
really good things of this life, than a
nation that subordinates the spiritual
to the secular, and seeks only material
goods. We believe, and the author
proves it, that there is even now
more real wealth and well-being in
Catholic than in Protestant nations;
though we agree with the author,
that if it were not so, it would be no
argument against the church.</p>

<p>The question of tolerance and intolerance,
and of civil and religious
liberty, as related to Catholic and
Protestant nations respectively, will
form the subject of a future article.
In the mean time we commend again
to our readers the work we are reviewing.</p>

<h2>UNTYING GORDIAN KNOTS.</h2>


<h3>I.<br />

LADY SACKVIL'S JOURNAL.</h3>

<p><i>Venice, April 3d, 185-.</i> Arrived
this afternoon, and was received by
Flora at the station in an embossed
gondola with crimson awnings. Ah
me! the delicious glow of a new sensation.
By what blessed exception
was Venice reserved to me for the
thirty-first year of that stagnation we
call life, and for the second year of
dowagerhood? As we floated up to
Beldoni Palace, the blood of nineteen
flowed in my veins. But in the
marble court, perfumed with orange-blossoms
exhaling youth and hope,
the twins rushed out upon me, crying,
"Auntie!" Bah! I was again
myself, smothered in crape and bombazine,
with the heart of a jade-stone
and the circulation of a crocodile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[590]</a></span></p>

<p>As we stood beneath the fig-trees
in the garden, Flora whispered, "Look
at the middle window of the third
story." I looked, and beheld a brown-haired
woman, in a soft blue dress,
pushing aside a mass of passion-vine,
and watching us. A pretty picture
enough, made warm and glowing in
the last rays of sunset! "Who is
it?" "Nicholas Vane's wife. I wrote
you of his marriage two years ago.
They have taken an apartment we
do not use, and we are constantly together.
You remember that George
owes his success in life to Mr. Vane,
and he has always been like an elder
brother to Nicholas."</p>

<p>"She's rather pretty, is she not?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly pretty, but excessively
nice. George respects her immensely."</p>

<p>"George, George, George!" the
point of every moral and adornment
of every tale. George does not respect
<em>me</em> immensely; but I am not
sure that I value his opinion less for
that reason&mdash;heaven help me!</p>

<p>Well, if Nicholas Vane makes
his wife half as wretched as he made
me ten years ago, I pity her. I have
always wished for an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclaircissement</i>
with him on the subject of my marriage
with Sackvil. Perhaps it may
come now.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>4th.</i>&mdash;Created a revolution in the
household to-day; persuaded Flora
to have the Erard "grand" moved
into a great old barn of a room seldom
used, where one can write and
practise without interruption. She
had intended to give up one of her
prettiest rooms to me; but I've taken
a fancy to this one, which will be too
desolate to tempt any one to share
my solitude.</p>

<p>George is charmed to have me establish
myself at such a distance from
the rest of the family. He at once
ordered in orange-trees and ivies
to adorn my dungeon&mdash;a delightful
thought; but the dreary waste is fast
becoming a blossoming oasis. I am
writing now by the jalousied window,
half listening to the dip of oars as
the gondolas go lazily by in the afternoon
light.</p>

<p>A glorious piano-tuning this morning,
much to Flora's disgust. "Let
me send to Lupi's for a tuner, dear,"
she entreated, as I produced fork and
key from the depths of a show work-basket.
"It looks so masculine."</p>

<p>"It should be <em>feminine</em> to bring
harmony out of discord," I answered.
"No piano of mine shall be intrusted
to a hireling."</p>

<p>I talked and tuned, tuned and talked&mdash;not
simultaneously but in strata&mdash;and
had possessed myself of the interior
history of the Vane family by
the time the piano answered my
searching ears harmoniously.</p>

<p>Mary Terence was the daughter
of a clever author, of some pretensions
to literary fame, but better
known in Boston as a brilliant talker.
She was left an orphan at nineteen,
poor and unprotected. Vane, who
had been one of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">habitués</i> of her
father's house, admired her sweet
devotion to the crotchety old man.
She was a Catholic, too; and though
Nicholas never cared much for his
religion himself, he was always fond
of seeing other people practise it,
as I remember painfully. But, however
it happened, through religion or
love, or caprice, or whatever, he married
the young thing, and fancies
there was never seen her equal.</p>

<p>The piano tuned, I betook myself
to practising <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Variations Sérieuses</i>, and
Saran's variations in the same style,
but founded on a theme far nobler
than the one Mendelssohn has taken.
Saran is capable of great things, but
will probably fail to accomplish them,
as this period of our century especially
discourages development. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[591]</a></span>
excite hopes and disappoint them
appears to be the summit of youthful
ambition, at least in the musical
world.</p>

<p>I was feeling very happy at the
piano; keys cool and smooth; nerves
impressionable but not impressed;
my ivy-garnished dungeon excellent
in its acoustic effects; Flora, in a senseless
sort of way, a sympathetic listener.
Now and then a servant came
to her for orders, but her voice is one
that harmonizes with stillness. Flora
is surely the sweetest, calmest, most
beautiful simpleton I have ever known.</p>

<p>Mendelssohn and Saran having tired
me, Chopin came to the rescue&mdash;mazurkas,
preludes, nocturnes. Why
did I play so well? Why was that
scherzo on the music-desk, and why
do its leaves turn so inconveniently?
As I came within two bars of the
close of the third page, a hand turned
it deftly. I knew the hand of old,
and its rare faculty for turning music
well. With difficulty I repressed a
start of surprise, for I had thought
myself alone with Flora. But the
agony of recollection quivered in my
nerves, impressed now as well as impressionable.
I had not believed
myself susceptible of such emotion,
or capable of such repression of feeling,
if once aroused.</p>

<p>The scherzo ended, I paused, but
for a moment could not summon
courage to break the silence that
followed. At last I turned to leave
the piano. Vane was sitting behind
me on the right. His lips parted
painfully in a smile as he greeted
me. Strange! What was it to either
of us but a glance into a past we
would both destroy if that were possible;
a furtive peep into a magic
mirror we thought broken long ago.</p>

<p>The brown-haired nymph of the
passion-vine was half reclining on a
lounge with the happy, musing look
of one who seldom muses. I had
meant to take the initiative with her,
accepting her as Flora's friend, and
gradually admitting her to intimacy.
To my surprise, I found myself responding
gratefully to her pleasant
welcome, and wishing in my hidden
soul she might find something in me
to like. Where lies her power? As
yet I cannot tell. Vane is very little
changed in ten years; lines deepened
but not altered. There is evidently
a charming relation between him and
his wife. She is the stronger of the
two in character, I fancy&mdash;a simple,
genuine person, what more I do not
yet know.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Nicholas Vane's library overlooked
the garden of Palazzo Beldoni.
The dimensions of the room, the
windows curtained with vines in the
month of April, the glowing sunlight
that forced its way in between swaying
branches, all spoke of Italy;
but New England comfort held a
cozy reign within doors; husband
and wife were occupied together before
the great-study table covered
with plans of fortifications; she in
making extracts from books of reference,
he in working out the minor
details of a design.</p>

<p>"How odd that I should have forgotten!"
Mary said suddenly, pausing
in her work with a look of surprise
and recollection. "Flora charged
me to tell you that Lady Sackvil
has written to say that she is coming
here. She will arrive this afternoon
in all probability, and I was to have
told you of it yesterday. However,"
she added after a pause, "you don't
seem to take much interest in my
great piece of news, so the delay has
done no harm."</p>

<p>"Amelia Grant is coming&mdash;Lady
Sackvil, I mean!" Nicholas said slowly,
but without pausing in his work.
"Very well, I hope you will like her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[592]</a></span></p>

<p>"It never occurred to me not to
like her," Mary answered. "In the
first place, she is Flora's sister; in
the second place, she is a very fascinating
woman; in the third place,
she is a riddle I hope to solve; in the
fourth place&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In the fourth place," exclaimed
Vane, throwing down his pencil with
one of those short laughs that quench
enthusiasm and kindle wrath at the
same moment; "in the fourth place,
my beloved &OElig;dipus, she is a sorceress
who will read you at sight. Amelia
Grant is the mirror of the person she
is with; when you fancy you are deciphering
her, you will be simply gazing
at a reflection of yourself&mdash;no unpleasant
sight, I acknowledge," he
added kindly, seeing that his rough
answer had brought the color to her
cheeks; "but it will not solve you
the riddle. Look here, child. I
am sorry Lady Sackvil is coming
here. She is a worldly, heartless woman;
full of ability, full of attraction;
but let me tell you this: if eating
your little innocent heart could afford
her an afternoon's entertainment, she
would not hesitate to do it."</p>

<p>He paused, rose and went to the
window. Mary remained at the table,
making sketches upon the baize
cover with her pen-handle.</p>

<p>"She must play for us, though,"
said Captain Vane, coming out of a
brown study and returning to his
seat. "She was the cleverest amateur
I have ever heard; and they say
Lord Sackvil indulged every whim
and carried her from Leipsic to Weimar,
and from Weimar to Berlin,
as her fancy suggested. She went
through a conservatory course at
Leipsic, and graduated most creditably.
Yes, she is astonishingly clever,
beyond dispute, and capable of great
self-devotion to her art. Of all the
persons I have known, men or women,
she is the most impressionable,
mobile, sympathetic, dramatic." And
again he merged into a reverie, while
Mary continued the ungrateful task
of drawing on the table-cover.</p>

<p>"Miss Grant had a great many
lovers, I suppose," she said at length.</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;yes&mdash;probably&mdash;perhaps
not. Just look at plan four,
and give me the length of line A-Q."</p>

<p>"One inch&mdash;three inches&mdash;six feet.
If you don't answer my question, I
shall not answer yours," said Mary,
laying her head down on the table.</p>

<p>Vane laughed, and looked out the
reference himself.</p>

<p>"She was married at twenty, you
goose; so it is not probable that she
had many declared lovers."</p>

<p>"What sort of man was Lord
Sackvil?"</p>

<p>"Lift up your head and go to work
and I will tell you&mdash;there. Lord
Sackvil was a clever, kindly man of
about forty-five, rich but fond of
diplomatic life. He came to Washington
on a special mission. Amelia
met him in society, mirrored his cleverness,
and kindliness, and diplomacy,
and married him after an engagement
of three weeks."</p>

<p>"Was the marriage a happy one?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;I never asked&mdash;I
don't care. Stop asking questions;
I'm sick of the subject."</p>

<p>"I verily believe she has come. I
hear voices in the garden," cried
Mary, springing from her seat and
running to the window. "Yes; it
must be Lady Sackvil, talking with
Flora under the trees. There, she
turned and looked at me. Oh! do
come here; she is very lovely."</p>

<p>"Mary, come here," said Vane
sharply. "Don't stand staring at
what does not concern you. There,
I've upset the inkstand. Now you
must come and help me."</p>

<p>"If you had upset the universe, I
should leave you to wipe it up yourself.
Why, my dear, I never expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[593]</a></span>
to know a live countess. I really
must look at her."</p>

<p>"Mary, come to me," said Vane
sternly, rising from his seat.</p>

<p>She came slowly toward him, and
stood looking up in his face with an
expression half of fun, half of amazement.</p>

<p>"I had not supposed you capable
of such babyish conduct," he said,
the blood rushing to his face.</p>

<p>"I have been very silly," Mary
said. "O Nicholas! you don't know
how silly I have been. I will never,
never behave so again&mdash;or think such
thoughts again," she added, looking
at him with an expression of absolute
sincerity and trustfulness. "I will all
my life trust you as you trust me."</p>

<p>"Do no such thing," he answered
hastily. "I am a man like half the
men in the world, and women like
you are very rare. My darling," he
said tenderly, "I love you; and I revere
you too&mdash;words which should be very
precious to a wife. Love may pass,
but reverence never. You are my
preserver in this world; you are my
strength, my patience, my all, God
help me! When I look into those
sweet, truthful, innocent eyes, they
give me all the strength I need for
life. Mary, never distrust me&mdash;never,
never distrust me, for I love and honor
you."</p>

<p>"Thank God for that!" she answered
softly. "But please don't
place your dependence on me. If I
had strength to give you, you should
have it if my very life had to pay for
the gift. But you cannot live vicariously.
You cannot receive strength
through me. I do not regret behaving
so foolishly to-day merely because I
have displeased you. If I am silly, you
had better know it. But I am afraid
you will think that confessing my faults
does me so little good that you will
be less than ever inclined to confess
your own."</p>

<p>"Make yourself quite easy on that
point," said Captain Vane, smiling.
"I will not judge things good in
themselves by your malpractices. But
let me speak to you very seriously, my
dear child. I love you tenderly, and
I love no one else in the world; but
if your suspicions had been correct,
you took the worst means in the world
to mend matters. Suspicions are excessively
irritating to a man, and none
the less so, you may be sure, when
they are well-grounded. And now I
freely forgive you all your sins toward
me, real and imaginary, and I think
if Angelo were to come and wash
away that pool of ink on the <i>parquet</i>,
all traces of this terrible passage of
arms might be effaced."</p>

LADY SACKVIL'S JOURNAL.</h3>

<p>Flora came into the room to-day,
while Josephine was dressing my hair.
My cap was lying on the dressing-table.
She took it up and examined it
thoughtfully. "Milly," she said at
last, "do me a favor. Give up wearing
caps. I cannot bear to have your
lovely hair covered. Besides, the
usual time for wearing close mourning
is passed; and I am convinced that
common rules of etiquette should be
followed in these matters. If you
continue to wear black beyond the
usual period, you will lay it aside some
day because your grief is diminished,
and that is not a pleasant idea."</p>

<p>Flora is a wise woman, within a
very narrow range. And so the caps
are laid aside. I do it with a kind
of regret. I remember fancying,
when I first adopted them, that I had
assumed unworldliness with them. I
do not wish to make the smallest
sacrifice to duty, but no one enjoys
<em>feeling</em> good more than I do. My
hair <em>is</em> beautiful. It looks so nicely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[594]</a></span>
in great smooth rolls fastened with
an ivory comb. I think I should go
mad if I were ugly; if I were not
sure of attracting any one I care to
attract&mdash;except George Holston.
But never mind his disapproval! It
is pleasanter to be disliked than disregarded,
at least to an egotist like myself.
To-night we had good music.
Only the Vanes were here, Flora, and
I. It was interesting to introduce
them to certain Schumann songs they
had not seen; Franz songs of which
they had never even heard; then
Chopin, as the moonlight streamed in
at the great window by the piano,
making candles unnecessary. "More,
more," said Mrs. Vane, when I paused.
"No more of that kind," said
Nicholas, laughing. "I need rebuilding
at present." So we had glorious
John Sebastian Bach, ending with an
organ prelude and fugue arranged by
Liszt. Vane listened, looking out
of the window upon the canal. Mrs.
Vane looked transfigured, like one
who had found a great calmness and
strength. I envied her, and yet
what should I do with calmness and
strength if I had them? Throw
them into the great pool of life and
watch the bubbles rise to the surface.
Nothing can add to Flora's serenity.
She rolled up her crochet work, laid
it away in a blue velvet sarcophagus,
and said, "Come into the other room
and we will have chocolate." When
we were alone, she asked, "Did you
ever notice how beautifully Nicholas
Vane's hair grows on his forehead?
And he has the most expressive eye-lids
I ever saw. You must look at
them some time." I promised to do so.</p>

<p>I am arranging a Schumann quartette
for the piano. I find that Mrs.
Vane knows very little of his music.
How enchanting transcription is!
One finds in it, I am confident, some
of the delights of creation. It is only
eleven; I can have two good hours
of work before going to bed.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>"Nicholas, did you ever tell your
wife of your engagement to Amelia
Grant?" asked George Holston, abusing
the occasion of a visit from his
adopted brother by asking unpleasant
questions.</p>

<p>Vane knocked the ashes off his
cigar and answered curtly, "No."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because it was a disagreeable subject;
because the matter was dead
and buried years before I saw Mary;
because I didn't choose to speak of it."</p>

<p>"I think you made a mistake."</p>

<p>"I don't."</p>

<p>"I do; and I will tell you why,
though you don't wish to hear. A
man can't put too many barriers between
himself and temptation. You
are now brought unexpectedly into
daily intercourse with Amelia. Long
after actual love dies out, personal influence
continues dangerous. If you
had told your wife of your former
connection, it would have acted as a
useful check upon you, unconsciously,
of course."</p>

<p>"I need no check," answered Vane
in a tone of annoyance, "beyond my
love for Mary, and my distrust of
Lady Sackvil. Mary knows I had
an old love affair, but does not know
with whom. You need not disturb
yourself. I know Amelia Grant of
old."</p>

<p>"I doubt it. You exaggerate her
faults. She is by no means deficient
in good qualities, if she chose to use
them. She is a woman ruined by bad
training; educated systematically to
selfishness, vanity, self-will. She is
the most worldly woman of her years
I have ever known; but her most
dangerous trait, as accompanying so
many faults, is the yearning for better
things that makes her interesting.
She thinks I dislike her. On the contrary,
I find her very attractive, though
I am determined to do nothing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[595]</a></span>
induce her to prolong her stay with
us."</p>

<p>"I don't know any thing about her
capacities for good," Vane remarked
dryly. "I know that we had not
been engaged twenty-four hours before
she was receiving Lord Sackvil's
attentions freely. At the end of
three days of befooling, I put an end
to the farce and left the coast clear
for his lordship. Flora knows all
about this, of course?"</p>

<p>"Evidently not. They were never
together during their girlhood. Besides,
Amelia never reveals any thing
discreditable to herself, you may be
sure. Keep out of her way, Vane;
she has gifts which are especially attractive
to you. But, by Jupiter! it
is rather an insult to fancy that any
one can fascinate you after your wife,
who is nearer perfection than any woman
I ever saw."</p>

<p>"Upon my word!" said Vane, glad
of a diversion, "these are agreeable
sentiments. I think if any body has
ground for jealousy, it is poor me. I
have not the slightest doubt that
Mary will eventually be canonized,
but I'll thank you to defer all sentiments
of veneration until then."</p>

<p>At this moment a servant announced
that Mrs. Holston and Lady Sackvil
were in the gondola waiting for Captain
Vane.</p>

<p>Nicholas took his hat and rose.
"Keep your eyes and your wisdom
to yourself, George," he said, in answer
to Holston's glance of amusement.
"It is a bad thing to be wiser
than your day and generation."</p>

<p>"So Cassandra found," replied
Holston; "but she was right, for all
that."</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>"Lay her down by me, Debby,"
said Mrs. Vane to the comfortable-looking
old body who was serving as
nurse to a second generation. "Lay
her beside her own little mamma.
Was she very good? Did Padre
Giulio think her lovely? Didn't she
cry the least bit while he was pouring
the water?"</p>

<p>"Just enough, mum, to let the old
Adam out," answered Debby, tucking
up mother and child energetically.
"As for the Paddry, he thought
she was a perfect pink; and he'd had
the chill took off the water, thanks
be to praise! It seems only yesterday,"
continued Debby contemplatively,
"I was a holdin' Mr. Nicholas
to be christened. He roared loud
enough for two generations, I recollect,
and now he's a cap'n in the
army. Well, we're all agin'. Now,
mum, I'll trust her with you a little
while till I can get that gruel made.
That Jovanny puts sorrel into it the
minute my back's turned. Now you
can take just as good care of baby,
Miss Vane, as if I was here, and
don't you go a tirin' yourself. Mr.
Nicholas lays all the blame on me if
your cheeks burn."</p>

<p>As the door closed behind the
nurse, Mary nestled the baby close,
and gave herself up to the ecstasy
of her new joy. We will follow her
thoughts as if they had been spoken.
Happiness like hers seldom finds vent
in words.</p>

<p>"I need no book of meditation
with you beside me, baby. I gave
you to God before your birth; I
brought you into the world to be a
saint, and, so help me heaven, I will
never stand between you and Him,
no matter what the struggle may cost
me. O holy little head! glorified by
the waters of baptism, with this kiss
I offer you to God, that he may fill
you with pure thoughts always tending
to heaven. Sweet little mouth,
speak comfort to every living creature.
Sweetest eyes, look heavenward;
and when you turn to earth,
may you see it strewn with roses as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[596]</a></span>
has been to me. Tender, pure feet,
may you never be stained with the
world's clay; walk firmly, bravely,
steadfastly, where the Infant Jesus
trod before you&mdash;yes, sweet, though
it should be on thorns, my tender,
precious one. And O little lovely
hands! work for God, work for his
poor and suffering ones, work for neglected
altars. O God! O God! it is
too sweet, too sublime, the possession
of this soul which I am to train for
thee. Make me as unflinching as
Queen Blanche, steadfast as St. Monica,
wise as St. Paula. May my child
and I revere each other, remembering
the Child Jesus and his Mother!
When I stand at thy judgment-seat,
dear Lord, may this plead for me,
that never by example or omission
have I caused my child to desist
from following thee."</p>

<p>Turning her head upon the pillow,
Mary saw her husband standing by
the bedside, looking at her and the
child. His eyes were full of tears as
he stooped and kissed her.</p>

<p>"This is the happiest day of my
life," she said as he sat down by her;
"the day of our baby's christening.
And do you know that I chose for it
the anniversary of the day when I
found out that you loved me."</p>

<p>"Tell me about that day."</p>

<p>"Won't nurse be here in a minute?"</p>

<p>"No; I have come in her stead,
as bearer of apologies. Giovanni has
done or left undone something with
regard to your dinner, I believe. And
now for the day when you made that
wonderful discovery. Come, I should
think the time for blushing about it
was over."</p>

<p>"It was the day before I was
to leave Boston," Mary explained.
"Almost every thing in the house
had been sold at auction. Oh! it
was so dismal! Only my room and
the library were comparatively untouched.
I was sitting on my trunk,
counting the money that was left after
poor papa's debts were paid."</p>

<p>"How much was there?"</p>

<p>"Just ten dollars. Enough to pay
my fare to Drewsville and leave me
within a few dollars of absolute dependence.
I hated the idea of going
to live with my Aunt Jane. But that
was not what I was thinking of, nor
my poverty, even while I counted my
money."</p>

<p>"What were you thinking of, dear?"</p>

<p>Her cheek flushed brightly. "I
had never loved any one before, you
know, Nicholas," she said apologetically.
"I did not know what it was,
or perhaps I could have helped it.
I knew there was a reason why it was
agony for me to leave Boston, and I
did not dare to try to find out what
the reason was. I knew there was a
pain within me harder to bear than
the grief for my father's death, but
that I must not even think of it. But
oh! when they told me that you were
in the library waiting to see me, then
I knew what the pain was, then I
knew what the agony was. Do you
wonder that I chose the anniversary
of that day? That day when we
stood together in the old house beside
the empty fireplace, and you asked
me to leave solitude and dependence
and homesickness, and be your
wife."</p>

<p>"Has it been all you thought it
would be?"</p>

<p>"All, and more than all," she
answered simply. And in his heart
he protested that she should never be
less happy in her love. As he left her
with the nurse, his heart was full of
wonder that so pure and true a creature
had been intrusted to his keeping.
Outside the door a note was
handed to him, one of Mrs. Holston's
perfumed, rose-colored billets, and
he stepped back into his wife's room
to read it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[597]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is the matter?" she asked,
seeing a look of annoyance or perplexity
on his face. He handed her
the note, and she read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Nicholas</span>: We are going to
Torcello to-morrow, and must have you
with us to expound the mysteries of the old
church, the arabesques, etc. We leave at
ten, and shall be gone all day. Don't say no
to yours very faithfully,</p>

<p class="signature">
F. R. H.<br />
</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;My sister says, 'Oh! yes. We
must have him; he is so <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">gemüthlich</i>.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>The reason for a refusal was simple
enough. His going would leave his
wife for a whole day to Debby's tender
but garrulous mercies; but this
was not for her to see or say. An
undefined distrust of Lady Sackvil,
which she believed to be quite groundless
made her urge his acceptance of
the invitation. He went to Torcello,
and all day long, in and out of measure
with the oars, these words rung
in his ears:</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">"All too good<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For human nature's daily food."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is a bad sign when one feels out of
harmony with one's best influences.</p>

<p>Mrs. Holston required her husband's
attendance, and Captain Vane
must do the honors of the island to
her sister. He was a man of artistic
perceptions and of accurate knowledge;
and Lady Sackvil's capacities
were of precisely the kind to draw
these out. Here was the great danger.
Mary, though intelligent and
sympathetic, could never be any thing
more than a good listener; Amelia
aroused every faculty within him to
full life. The day at Torcello did
more harm than many months could
undo.</p>

<h2>CHURCH MUSIC.</h2>

<p class="center">II.</p>


<p>"I do not believe in giving the
best music to the devil," said a friend
while holding with us an amicable
discussion on the subject which forms
the heading of this paper.</p>

<p>"You quote John Wesley, the
founder of the Methodist sect," we
replied. "Nevertheless, we agree
both with him and you. We do not
believe in giving any music whatever
to the devil."</p>

<p>"I would say," returned our friend,
"that the best music ought to be
given to God."</p>

<p>"Most assuredly," said we; "and
the poorest too. Why not?"</p>

<p>"I mean," our friend explained,
"that in the public worship of God
the best music should be used that
can be obtained."</p>

<p>"You reëcho our own sentiments,"
we rejoined. "But will you please
to define what you call <em>the best</em>?"</p>

<p>"Oh! nothing simpler," replied
our friend. "That music is the best
which is the most agreeable."</p>

<p>We murmured something about
"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de gustibus</i>," when our friend prudently
added, "to the occasion."</p>

<p>"And the occasion is&mdash;" we suggested.</p>

<p>"Is divine worship," continued
our friend. "Where the soul is instructed
by the divine truths the
holy offices of the Church impart,
and inspired with sentiments now of
prayer, now of praise, now of holy
joy, now of penitence, now of lamentation,
and so forth."</p>

<p>"Well said!" we exclaimed. "You
have again spoken our own mind.
But have you ever heard such music?"</p>

<p>"I have heard some very charming
music in my time," answered our
friend cautiously.</p>

<p>"Exactly answering to your definition?"</p>

<p>"Well, no. I cannot say <em>exactly</em>
answering to my definition."</p>

<p>"We have been more fortunate
than you," said we. "It has been
our lot to hear very charming music,
exactly answering to your definition."</p>

<p>"Where?" demanded our friend
earnestly.</p>

<p>"In many churches and monasteries
of Europe," we replied.</p>

<p>"What was its style and character?"
inquired our friend.</p>

<p>"The Gregorian Chant, pure and undefiled."</p>

<p>Our friend honorably closed the discussion
by reiterating his definition
and regretting his lack of experience.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In a former article we endeavored
to bring before our readers such
proofs of the statement we made, that
the use of modern music in the ritual
service of the Church was both
improper and illegal, as we thought
a very slight examination of the subject
would suggest. These proofs
were, however, not requisite, since it
is a patent fact that such music is
an innovation on the universal traditionary
use of the Gregorian chant;
an innovation, to judge from the
countries where it has crept in and
supplanted the old ritual song, that
is the result of a religious taste vitiated
by the influences of a spirit which,
if not precisely Protestant, is, to say
the least, worldly, anti-Christian, and
therefore anti-Catholic. If there be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[599]</a></span>
any, then, who prefer music of this
character to the authorized chant, it
is necessary for them to show good
reasons <i>for the liberty they take in
using it</i>, or why an immediate return
should not be made to what is, at
any rate, lawful and ordained, if it be
nothing more. In England, where
the ancient Catholic spirit is again
reviving, and a marked return to the
old paths is observable both in and
out of the Church, the subject of
church music has received an attention
and awakened an amount of investigation
second only to that devoted
to the dogmas of faith. And
we may here remark that this recent
study of the church chant is in no
sense conducted in the spirit of simple
antiquarian research&mdash;as it were,
to bring to light buried fragments of
a beautiful or useful institute characteristic
of a former age, for the admiration
of the curious&mdash;but in the express
intent of reinstating the ancient
church song to its rightful place in
the holy sanctuaries of sacrifice and
prayer.</p>

<p>That the Church has no notion of
giving up the Gregorian chant, but,
on the contrary, that she earnestly
desires its complete restoration in
those countries where it has fallen
into disuse, we hold to be entirely
beyond question. Whatever concessions
to the poverty of resources,
or to peculiar local circumstances,
for the occasional use of modern
music, the hierarchy may think it
prudent to make, is a subject for the
consideration of those who believe
themselves to be in such a position
as to need these concessions. What
is certain is, that the Church by the
mouth of her pastors has directed the
universal use of the Gregorian chant,
and as universally condemned the use
of our modern music.</p>

<p>Knowing, however, that the healing
of every sore takes time as well
as medicine, we admit that in many
places this much-needed reformation
cannot be instantaneously made.
With us in the United States, the
clergy, as a body, have but a slight
acquaintance, either theoretically or
practically, with the church chant;
and knowing, as we do from experience,
what false and barbaric executions
of it they have been condemned
to suffer in the course of their ecclesiastical
education, and from which
they have been naturally led to form
their judgments concerning it, we do
not wonder at the wide-spread prejudice
that exists against its use, and
the opposition to its introduction that
is met with, even at their hands.
That our laity have never given expression
to their own sentiments in its
regard is simply due to their complete
ignorance and total inexperience of
the whole subject. All fears, therefore,
of offending the people or of
alienating them from the solemn offices
of the Church, on account of the
banishment of florid music and the
introduction of plain chant, are, as
yet, groundless.</p>

<p>Esteeming it as a matter of great
moment, and urged by oft-repeated
solicitations on the part of their hierarchy,
the clergy in England and
Ireland have, for several years past,
been devoting their energies to carry
out the wishes of their superiors, and
devise some means to ameliorate the
condition of church music, acknowledged
to have, with them as with us,
gradually degenerated since the Reformation
of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>As far back as 1849, an effort was
made, with this end in view, to supply
proper singers in the churches, at
the head of which was the Cardinal,
then Bishop Wiseman. The vicars-apostolic
in synod had decreed,
"<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">F&oelig;mineæ voces ne audiantur in
choro</span>," hoping to gradually induce
a return to the established discipline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[600]</a></span>
of the Church. The present Archbishop
of Westminster, referring to this
in a letter, says,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Unfortunately, this decree has not been
carried out. I can only suppose that the
causes which brought in this deviation have
prevailed to obtain its toleration until such
time as we shall be able to do better. A
sudden order to remove women singers,
while as yet we have no boys trained to
take their places, would be inconvenient
and inconsiderate. I have not thought it
right to issue any such order. But all that
I can effect by the strongest expression of
desire and persuasion I shall endeavor to
effect."</p></blockquote>

<p>In a circular letter to his clergy, dated
May 8th, 1869, the archbishop prohibits
the employment of women singers
in all choirs to be newly formed.</p>

<p>We can well understand the end
had in view by this order for the exclusion
of female voices <i>from the choir</i>.
To us it is, in effect, an order for the
exclusion of all figured music, and
the restoration of plain chant. The
archbishop, however, seems to allow
the possibility of the composition
of "masses which, while they admit
the full compass and perfection of modern
musical science, exclude all that
is secular or theatrical, by retaining
the gravity and majesty of our ecclesiastical
and sacred tradition." This
is, however, only a concession; for he
had just before written, "When once
tried by experience, the grave, sweet,
majestic, intellectual <i>music of the
Church</i> will win all who are now in
favor of a less ecclesiastical style."</p>

<p>The hope expressed by Archbishop
Manning, that masses would be composed
for male voices only, and of
sufficiently grave character to suit the
services of the Church, was suggested,
doubtless, by some quite respectable
essays of this kind made on the Continent,
and offered to the Congress
of Malines at its late sessions, as well
by the labors in this direction of the
Rev. Canon Oakeley, to whom his
letter on this subject was addressed.
This reverend gentleman has been the
rector of a London parish for eighteen
years, and has never admitted a
female into his choir, although the
perfection of the musical department
in his church has received many high
encomiums. He supplies the soprano
parts by boys' voices, to the cultivation
of which he has devoted a
great deal of energy. The character
of his church music is as follows: At
High Mass, whatever is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de rigueur</i> for
the Sunday or festival is sung strictly
according to the Roman Gradual,
save those parts which may be ranged
under the title of Ordinarium
Missæ, namely, the Kyrie, Gloria,
Credo, Sanctus, and Agnus Dei. These
portions are not as a rule chosen
from the Gregorian chant, but are
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">morceaux</i> of selected modern music.
His Vesper and Compline service is
wholly Gregorian, as given in the
Vesperale Romanum. We believe
that, encouraged by his success in this
partial reformation, many priests in
Great Britain have followed his example.
We shall have occasion to
speak of this matter and give in another
paper some extracts of the
canon's opinion of the feasibility and
effectiveness of boy singers.</p>

<p>Taking the hint thrown out by his
grace the Archbishop of Westminster,
several skilled musicians have
already published a number of masses,
revised and corrected to suit the
late "Instructions" given by the
cardinal vicar to Roman composers
and singers, with a view to restrain
the attempts made even there to introduce
modern music. We do not
pretend to criticise these simplified
masses in this place. All we desire
to do is to call attention to the significance
of the movement toward musical
reformation. Whether second-rate
musical compositions are better
than the authorized chant, we think is
questionable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[601]</a></span></p>

<p>The original masses, composed in
the same intent, which competed for
the handsome prizes offered by the
late Catholic Congress of Malines, possess
much artistic merit; perhaps a
little too much, if intended for popular
use.</p>

<p>Wholly converted, as we are, in
heart and mind, to the exclusive
use of plain chant, we nevertheless
commend these well-meant efforts.
They are efforts in the right direction,
and similar ones, we doubt not, must
be made with us before the ancient
discipline of the Church concerning
her chant will prevail.</p>

<p>Something, at least, can be done,
and without delay. We cannot see
what possible excuse we have any
longer to offer for not singing the
Introit, the Gradual, Offertory, and
Communion at High Mass. These
parts of the Mass are quite as essential,
in the mind of the Church, as
the Kyrie, the Credo, the Sanctus, or
the Agnus Dei. If we are able to
procure the execution of most difficult
compositions for these latter portions,
we are surely quite as well able
to procure the chanting of the former.
It may be said that, if these now neglected
parts be sung as they should
be, and can only effectively be, in
Gregorian chant, it is possible one of
these different styles of music would
suffer much by contrast with the other.
To this we agree; but which
one will be the sufferer, our objector
and ourself might think differently.
Such a mixture has, however, been
considered, on the whole, preferable
by some in England who have
adopted it. Says a writer in <cite>The
Dublin Review</cite>, "We may remark
that if it be true that a constant recurrence
of the same unison masses,
Sunday after Sunday, would tax the
patience of our people, so, on the
other hand, that limited round of figured
masses to which it has been the
fashion to confine the choirs of almost
all our churches, is found by experience
to be, if any thing, more
tiring still." The writer adds, "We
ought to <em>enlarge</em> our stock of mass
music." We think it were better to
render passably the stock we already
possess. He continues, "We consider
that where success has attended
the efforts of clergy and choirs, to
render the services of the Church
noble, edifying, and attractive, it has
been by the combination we have
described; and to take one instance&mdash;it
is to this, and to the ecclesiastical
feature of a choir of boys and men
chanting Vespers, etc., in their proper
place in church, that we attribute
the fact that the church over which
Canon Oakeley presides has become
the centre of so much interest. And
when we mention that solemn Vespers
and Benediction are sung in this
Church, on all days of devotion, with
as much correctness and beauty as
on Sundays, and that a considerable
number of the faithful always assist on
such occasions, we shall have given
a specimen of the results which may
be expected to follow elsewhere, if
a like arrangement be adopted."</p>

<p>We know that there is always difficulty
in changing one's customs, but
it is the mark of Catholic zeal never
to shrink before any cost or sacrifice
where plain duty, the glory of God,
and the honor of the Holy Church
are in question. All must admit that
the custom of omitting any ceremony
or rite essential to the due celebration
of High Mass, or any other function,
is a bad custom&mdash;a custom to be discontinued
the moment it is in our
power to do so. The bishops assembled
in the late Plenary Council of
Baltimore made a special decree concerning
the due performance of the
Vesper service. What difficulty is
there here in obeying this decree both
in its letter and spirit? There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[602]</a></span>
enough books already published to
supply the singers with the proper
music for the entire service. Harmonized
versions of the psalms, antiphons,
and anthems have been
made for the use of those singers and
organists who are, as yet, ignorant
of plain chant, and accustomed only
to modern musical notation. If any
thing be wanting in these, the demand
for better and more convenient books
would soon be met with the supply.
Apart from their openly profane character,
we do not see what possible
plea can be put in for singing what
is called "Musical Vespers"&mdash;for the
most part, musical performances in
which it would be wholly impossible
to recognize the Vesper office, as
strictly ordained and enjoined by the
Church. The office of Vespers, according
to the Roman rite, is what
we are supposed to sing. We do not
hesitate to say that no "Musical
Vespers" ever sung in this country
were in conformity to that rite. Were
we to announce that fact to our music-loving
Protestant friends, who frequent
our churches at Vesper time,
to enjoy the beautiful "Vesper service,"
it might possibly prove a little
startling; and if they were at the
pains to inquire of what character
the service was which they saw and
heard, what answer could we honestly
make, but that it was a musical performance
of garbled portions of the
Vesper office, gotten up to answer
for the same, with a view of pleasing
the audience? Not only in High
Mass, then, but also in Vespers, there
is some amelioration possible to all,
the results of which will not only
bring our Church services more into
conformity with the spirit of the Universal
Church, and the decrees concerning
the due celebration of divine
worship issued by our hierarchy, but
we are fully assured will prove most
acceptable to the faithful, and contribute
no little to their edification.</p>

<p>We have indulged in the foregoing
somewhat desultory remarks before
entering upon the special purpose of
this paper, in hopes to direct the attention
of our readers to the gravity
of the subject in question, and to
show that we are very far from being
singular in its discussion. Whatever
may be the merits of our modern music,
and they certainly are of a very
high order, when considered from the
point of artistic combination, and the
expression of certain sentiments of
the soul, we hold, nevertheless, that
the Gregorian chant is the <i>true song
of the Catholic Church</i>. That it deserves
this title on the score of authority,
which has distinctly and universally
sanctioned it, we think we
have sufficiently proved; and as well
that other music has been as distinctly
condemned and rejected. We desire
now to examine the character of the
church chant, in its more intimate relations
with the ritual, and its unrivalled
religious expression, that its intrinsic
merits may be more clearly
understood and more heartily appreciated.</p>

<p>In the first place, the Church never
enjoins any thing without good
reason; and her reasons are grounded
not only in the conclusions of human
science, but in the perceptions
of a divine inspiration. We do not
hesitate to give the title of "divine"
to her sacred Liturgy and Office, because
we believe they were compiled
with the assistance of the Holy
Ghost. Is it unreasonable to suppose
that her chant, proceeding, as it
does, from the same source, the work
of the same hands and hearts to
whom she committed the labor of
the composition and compilation of
the words, and together accepted by
her, should have had the same divine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[603]</a></span>
aid? The question is well put by
one who has devoted much time and
thought to the subject of church
music:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Can we believe that the divine assistance
can have failed her so far that her
work, a discordant jumble of notes, should
not be fit to be sung by us in our country
and century? How different were the feelings
and the belief of the people during the
ages of faith! The monks and other holy
men who wrote those sacred chants, set
themselves to work sometimes after months
of holy meditation and of watching, of fasting
and of prayer; and then they composed
those melodies, so little appreciated now, because
so little known; but to the correct
religious taste of our pious ancestors in the
faith, so full of heavenly harmony that they
sometimes thought, and not always without
reason, the angels themselves had dictated
them."<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>That the Gregorian chant is yet, as
it was in former times, the true musical
expression of her Divine Office,
and of those portions of the liturgy
of the Holy Mass, and various public
functions, appointed to be sung, is
plain from the fact that, in despite of
all the development of the <i>musica
ficta</i> in the hands and with the influence
of its composers and lovers,
the Church still obstinately adheres to
those ancient melodies. What can
we say but that, as the Church is the
best judge of her own language of
prayer and praise, so she must equally
as well be of the form of its expression?</p>

<p>But, as we said before, the Church
never acts without reason. If she
accepts this form of chant in the first
place, it is because such a form of
melody is appropriate, and well becoming
her inspired language of prayer.
If she retains it through so many
ages, and has no thought of changing
it now, it is because the same reason
still holds good.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable points
in the character of the Gregorian chant
is the fact that it has partaken, possibly
by association, of the "perennial
freshness" which is so strongly marked
in the celebration of the rites and
ceremonies of the Church. To every
people, of all ages and countries,
these rites and ceremonies possess a
dramatic power of the highest order.
Ancient yet ever new, they never
weary by repetition as fast and festival
recur in the ecclesiastical year.
On this an English writer says,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The very ruggedness of the Gregorian
modes serves to impart to them a character
of durability. These simple melodies, as
we well know from the instance of the Vesper
Psalms, to mention no other, somehow
never pall upon the ear, and have, in fact, a
perennial freshness which we can only account
for by the circumstance of their having
a variety of scale which modern melodies
do not possess. This, too, is proved
by the well-known fact that the most beautiful
chants of the modern school (and we
ourselves are fain to add also the most beautiful
motets, Anthems, Glorias, Credos, etc.)
become unendurable by constant repetition;
and for this reason we find that even dissenters
have been fain to adopt the old chant
in their services."</p></blockquote>

<p>This is, to say the least, a very
strong practical confirmation of the
wisdom of the Holy Church in preserving
a treasure so precious that
even time does not waste it, or use
tarnish its beauty.</p>

<p>A second reason assigned by the
same writer, we give for what it is
worth. It possesses, indeed, no little
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vraisemblance</i>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We may look upon it in its plaintive if
not mournful character in fact, as a kind
of <i>pilgrim's song</i>, by which it would seem as
if the Church would have us remember,
even in the midst of our festal joys, that we
are the '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Exules filii Hevæ, gementes et flentes
in hâc lacrymarum valle</i>.' It is, we
may say, the grave, sweet, pathetic note
which the Church puts into the mouths of
her children, lamenting with the Psalmist
that 'their sojourning is prolonged;' the
plaintive accent in which they confess that
they are strangers upon earth, and that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[604]</a></span>
'seek another, even a heavenly city.' And
so Father Faber sings in his well-known
hymn&mdash;itself a kind of wayfarer's song&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'While we toil on, and soothe ourselves with weeping,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till life's long night shall break in endless love.'"<br /></span>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p>This is by no means a quaint conception
of modern fancy. St. Paschasius
Radpert, a monk of the abbey of
Old Corby, who lived about the year
800, says,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There is no song to be found without a
tone of sadness in it; even as here below
there are no joys without a mixture of sorrow;
for songs of pure joy belong only to
the heavenly Sion, but lamentation is the
property of our earthly pilgrimage."</p></blockquote>

<p>To us, however, the Gregorian
chant is the true song of the Church,
chiefly because it is essentially choral
in character; by which we mean that
its melodies, so simple in construction,
so massive in form, and its
grave and majestic rhythm, fit it eminently
for execution by large bodies
of singers, called in church parlance
the <i>schola</i>, or choir.</p>

<p>In the discipline of the early church
it was supposed that all the congregation
of the faithful present at the
Holy Sacrifice responded to the salutations
and solemn invitations of the
priest at the altar to unite with him
in prayer and acts of adoration.
We have before us a very old reproduction
of an ancient manuscript, entitled,<span lang="gr" xml:lang="gr">
&#7977; &#934;&#949;&#8054;&#945; &#955;&#949;&#953;&#964;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#947;&#8055;&#945;

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Missa Apostolica;
seu, Divinum Sacrificium S. Apostoli

authority, to be the Mass of St. Peter.
At the close of the Offertory, we read
as follows; we quote the Latin version
given side by side with the Greek:</p>

<blockquote  lang="la" xml:lang="la">

<p>"<i>Deinde sacerdos voce clara dicit.</i></p>

<p>"Dominus vobiscum.</p>

<p>"<i>Populus.</i> Dignum et justum est."</p></blockquote>

<p>The priest continues to chant the
preface. At the close of it the people
sing the Sanctus, and answer
<i>Amen</i> when the priest has pronounced
the words of consecration. The
entire <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pater noster</i> is given to the
people, and they respond to the
usual salutations made after the communion.
A side rubrical note, referring
to the parts assigned to the populus
or people, says, "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Populi vox est
et cantorum</i>."</p>

<p>This manner of celebrating High
Mass will seem to many of our readers
as strange and obsolete; but such
is precisely the manner in which one
can yet hear the Holy Sacrifice in
many towns and villages on the continent
of Europe, in the year of our
Lord eighteen hundred and sixty-nine;
and we need hardly say with
what sublime and soul-stirring effect.</p>

<p>We do not think it at all probable
that this old form of congregational
accompaniment of the Mass ever can
be universally revived. Yet it must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[605]</a></span>
be acknowledged that no more complete,
intelligent, or edifying expression
of the Great Eucharistic Rite
could possibly be desired.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Shall we ever see the day," asks a writer
in the old <cite>Dublin Review</cite>, "when, on
entering a Catholic church during service
time, we shall be struck, not with the dampening
spectacle of a congregation partly
composed of unbelievers in the act of enjoying
the pleasure of a Sunday concert,
while the remainder, with closed books in
their lap, or by their side, wait patiently or
impatiently till the prolonged and a hundred
times repeated <i>Amen</i> of the Gloria or the
Creed deigns to come to an end, but with the
refreshing sight of an unmixed body of true
worshippers, learned and ignorant, high
and low, rich and poor, unostentatiously led
by a select choir, engaged in heartily singing
the praises of Him in whose house they
are assembled? To so consoling and truly
Catholic a state of things should all our reforms
tend; for it will only be when it is
established that we shall be able to taste the
sweetness, as well as delight in the beauty
and feel the grandeur of that congregational
singing which so many desire, but which is
incompatible with an encouragement in
churches of the music of <i>Don Giovanni</i>, <i>Fidelio</i>,
<i>Lodoiska</i>, <i>Il Barbière</i>, and <i>Faust</i>."</p></blockquote>

<p>Were this revival of congregational
singing in the mind of the Church,
there could be no question about the
form of melody to be applied. No
one would think of looking elsewhere
than to plain chant as the only practical
and fitting resource in that event.</p>

<p>But, as in past times there was
always the select <i>schola</i> or choir to
whom the choral selections of the
divine offices were committed, so
at the present day it would seem to
be that which the Church aims mainly
at preserving. Indeed, as Dr. Lootens
well observes, the very architectural
dispositions of our churches,
when constructed according to the
ritual, suppose such a body of singers,
who, being the coadjutors of the
sacred ministers, are supposed to possess
a quasi-ecclesiastical character,
and appear in the sanctuary properly
vested as <i>clerici</i>, or clerks, and whose
demeanor, as well as singing, is of
that grave and decorous character
which beseems the house of God and
the presence of the Holy Sacrament.
The learned prelate says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A Protestant meeting-house is built to
preach in; the nearer the minister is to the
people, the better he is heard. <em>Our</em> churches
are, first of all, places of worship. Nothing
so affects the visitor who enters one
of our churches in the old country as the
mysterious depth of their sanctuaries. We
allude here not merely to the Gothic cathedrals,
but to all kind of churches, no matter
to what particular order of architecture they
belong. Architects, in those ancient times,
would as soon have thought of planning
a church without a chancel, (choir,) as of
building one without a roof."</p></blockquote>

<p>We also might well say that when
any Catholic from the Continent visits
Protestant England and enters one
of those ancient cathedrals, once the
glory and pride of Catholic England,
now fallen into the hands of strangers
who know not their meaning nor sacred
uses; and when he sees those
mysteriously deep sanctuaries, whose
stalls are no longer filled, as of yore,
with the devout white-robed clerics,
or it may be with cowled monks,
chanting the divine hours of prayer,
or responding to the sacrificing priest,
but with a few fashionably dressed
ladies and gentlemen looking at each
other across the once consecrated
place, hallowed by the footsteps of
saints, and praying to be delivered
"from all error, heresy, and schism,"
(save the mark!) what an indescribable
pain must wring his soul; how
involuntarily the plaintive words of
the Psalmist must rise upon his lips,
"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Super flumina Babylonis, illic sedimus,
et flevimus, cum recordaremur
Sion!</i>"</p>

<p>Yet, let him come to our land and
visit <em>our Catholic</em> churches&mdash;but we
anticipate; it is not of the proper
place for the choir, but of the choir
itself we wish to speak.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[606]</a></span></p>

<p>A select choir of clerks, or singers
vested in cassock and surplice, who,
ranged in the sanctuary, chant <i>in
chorus</i> the Asperges, the Introit, Kyrie,
Gloria, Gradual, Credo, Offertory,
Sanctus, Agnus Dei, Communion, and
the responses of High Mass, and the
antiphons, psalms, versicles, etc., at
Vespers, is what the ritual supposes
and expressly demands. A choir of
mixed voices gathered in a gallery at
the extreme end of the church, either
hidden behind curtains or exposed to
view, has neither been ever supposed
or sanctioned by the ritual, much
less the omission of nearly one half
of what is ordered to be sung. When
we look at the actual state of things
as they are in vogue amongst us, and
honestly look the ritual of the Holy
Church in the face, does not our
memory sometimes remind us of the
reproach of Almighty God to the negligent
priests of the old law?&mdash;"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non
servastis præcepta sanctuarii mei</i>;" a
reflection which is not ours, but very
pertinently made by the zealous American
bishop whose words we have
already quoted.</p>

<p>If, as has been well said, "Our present
defective knowledge and appreciation
of the liturgy is one of the indications
of an enfeebled faith among
a Catholic people," so we do not hesitate
to affirm that a reasonable knowledge
of, and constant participation
in the divine offices of the Church is
practically necessary to an intelligent
faith in the great mysteries of religion,
and the only means of keeping alive
and nourishing true Catholic devotion.
Prayer said in union with the
Church is both the light of the understanding
and the fire of divine love for
the heart.</p>

<p>One of the directors of the seminary
of St. Sulpice, in Paris, in a recent
publication, entitled, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Saint Office
considéré au point de Vue de la Piété</i>,
significantly remarks:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"Quand on voit la piété se refroidir en tant
d'endroits, il est naturel de craindre qu'on
ne l'envoque le bon Dieu avec tant de ferveur,
que le feu sacré ne languisse dans son
sanctuaire. C'est le moment de se demander
si les adorateurs ne seraient devenus plus
froids en devenant plus rares, <em>si le silence des
temples n'a pas amené le sommeil des âmes</em></span>."</p>

<p>When one sees piety growing cold in so
many places, it is but reasonable to fear that
God is invoked with so little fervor because
the sacred fire is dying out in his sanctuary.
It is time to ask ourselves if the worshippers
have not become less devout in becoming
less attentive at the services of the church;
if the silence of our temples of religion has
not brought on the sleep of souls.</p></blockquote>

<p>The slightest examination of the
offices of the Church will show how
well they are adapted to instruction
in doctrine, and for the illustration
of the Gospel record and the historic
acts and interior life of Christianity.
We have not the time in this place,
nor is it necessary, to adduce proofs
of this. They whose interest in this
matter we aim at arousing have a
daily reminder of its truth.</p>

<p>That these holy offices are the
fountain-head of solid, popular devotion
is equally indisputable. We
have nothing to replace them, nor do
we care to have. We have plenty of
so-called "popular devotions," admirably
adapted for their special purposes;
but it must be confessed that
<i>popular devotion</i> is far below that
standard of spirituality which the
Church aims at inspiring; and which
it is not only possible to attain, but
which in ages gone by, whose grade
of refinement and intellectual culture
we affect to despise, was the normal
standard of Catholic piety. From
whence did the people draw this
strong and healthy nourishment of
the spiritual life? The answer will be
found in the fact that the people were
educated from childhood in the liturgy,
and they were not, as now, for
the most part spectators, but participators
at the celebration of the solemn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[607]</a></span>
instructive, and devout offices of the
Church.</p>

<p>The accomplished author of the
remarkable work on <i>Christian Schools
and Scholars</i> thus writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The fact is that, in one respect, the rude,
ignorant peasantry of the middle ages were
a great deal more learned than the pupils of
our modern schools. In a certain sort of
way, every child was rendered familiar with
the language of the Church. From infancy
they were taught to recite their prayers, the
antiphons, and many parts of the ritual of
the Church, in Latin, and to understand the
meaning of what they learnt; and hence
they became familiar with a great number of
Latin words, so that a Latin discourse would
sound far less strange in their ears than in
those of a more educated audience of the
same class in the present day. In many
cases, indeed, the children who were taught
in the priest's, or parochial school, learned
grammar, that is&mdash;the Latin language; but
all were required to learn the church chant,
and a considerable number of Latin prayers,
and hymns, and psalms. This point of
poor-school education deserves more than
a passing notice. Its result was, that the
lower classes were able thoroughly to understand
and heartily to take part in the
rites and offices of Holy Church. The faith
rooted itself in their hearts with a tenacity
which was not easily destroyed, even by
penal laws, because they imbibed it from
its fountain source&mdash;the Church herself. She
taught her children out of her own ritual,
and by her own voice, and made them believers
after a different fashion from those
much more highly educated Catholics of
the same class who, in our day, often grow
up almost as much strangers to the liturgical
language of the Church as the mass of
unbelievers outside the fold. Can there be
any incongruity more grievous than to enter
a Catholic school, rich in every appliance of
education, and to find that, in spite of the
time, money, and method lavished on its
support, its pupils are unable to understand
and recite the church offices, and are untrained
to take part in church psalmody?
The language of the Church has, therefore,
in a very literal sense, become a dead language
to them, and it is from other and far
inferior sources that they derive their religious
instruction. Thus they are ignorant
of a large branch of school education, in
which the children of a ruder and darker
age were thoroughly trained; no doubt, on
the other hand, they know a great many
things of which children in the middle ages
were altogether ignorant; and the question
is simply to determine which method of instruction
has most practical utility in it.
Without dogmatizing on this point, we may
be permitted to regret that through any defect
in the system of our parochial schools,
Catholic congregations should in our own
days be deprived of the solemn and thorough
celebrations of those sacred offices which in
themselves comprise a body of unequalled
religious instruction; and that, in an age
which makes so much of the theory of education,
we should have to confess our inability
to teach our children to pray and sing
the prayers of the Church as the children
of Catholic peasants prayed and sang them
six hundred years ago. The English schools
of that period enjoyed the benefit of no
other inspection than that of the parish
priest and the archdeacon, 'the eye of the
bishop,' as he was called; and if their pupils
knew little about 'monocotyledons,'
the 'crustacea,' or grammatical analysis, they
were able to recite their Alma Redemptoris
and their Dixit Dominus with hearty, <em>intelligent</em>
devotion.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
They knew the order of
the church service, and could sing its psalms
and antiphons in the language of the church,
and to her ancient tones."</p></blockquote>

<p>The last words of this most interesting
extract will spare us the trouble
of insisting at any great length
upon the point chiefly in question.
The sacred offices of the Church, to
whose due celebration and to their
intelligent participation in them the
faith and piety of our ancestors is in
great measure to be ascribed, and the
peculiar and inimitable melodies, yet,
happily, undivorced from their language
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[608]</a></span>
of prayer, ever formed one inseparable
whole.</p>

<p>A revival of those offices in the
spirit of their ancient fidelity to the
ritual is, as all must allow, a revival
of Gregorian chant. The project of
substituting in its place a selection
of solos, duets, etc., either culled from
threadbare compositions of the two
last centuries, notorious for their sensuousness
of style and over-wrought
"word-painting," or such melodies of
the modern schools as our present
masters are able to produce, would be
unhesitatingly ridiculed on all sides.</p>

<p>Far be it from us to be guilty of
the presumption of questioning the
wisdom of the Church in permitting
to the clergy the individual and private
recitation of the Divine Office;
but it is beyond dispute that so much
of it as is enjoined to be performed
publicly, <i>in choir</i>, on Sundays and festivals,
is not absolved by the <i>bravura</i>
singing of some "choice musical selections"
in an organ-gallery, and the
private recitation of the real office
meanwhile by a lonely celebrant in
the sanctuary. Moreover, the people
are thereby greatly hindered in their
devotions and deprived utterly of
the spiritual fruit the sacred office so
abundantly affords. If we gave the
people a chance, we would very soon
see how joyfully they would sing their
Credo, and heartily chant their Dixit
Dominus, as of old. "I do not like
the Vespers in &mdash;&mdash; street," a well-instructed
servant was lately overheard
to say; "it is nothing but a
concert of four opera-singers, and I'm
all astray while it's going on. Nobody
seems to make it out but the
Protestant ladies and gentlemen, who
do nothing but talk about it all the
time. Give me the singing at Father
&mdash;&mdash;'s church, where all the
clergy sing, and where I can sing in
the Tantum Ergo myself at benediction,
if I like."</p>

<p>What we are arguing for is a strict,
rubrical celebration of High Mass and
Vespers, the two public offices enjoined
upon the clergy in this country.
When the rubrics for these offices are
observed to the letter, we shall have
no fear for the fate of plain chant,
which has proved itself by the experience
of so many centuries to be
the only adequate and satisfying expression
of the spirit of prayer that
breathes through all the solemn ritual
service of the Holy Church.</p>

<p>The words of the pious and erudite
Benedictine monk, Dom Gueranger,
Abbot of Solesmes, are again ringing
in our ears. We cannot refrain from
closing our article with a quotation
from the preface to his <i>Liturgical Year</i>,
the beauty of which will be a sufficient
apology for its length:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The prayer of the Church is the most
pleasing to the ear and heart of God, and
therefore the most efficacious of all prayers.
Happy, then, is he who prays with the
Church, and unites his own petitions with
those of this Spouse, who is so dear to her
Lord that he gives her all she asks. It
was for this reason that our Blessed Saviour
taught us to say <i>our Father</i>, and not <i>my Father</i>;
<i>give us, forgive us, deliver us</i>, and not
<i>give me, forgive me, deliver me</i>. Hence, we
find that, for upward of a thousand years, the
Church, who prays in her temples seven
times in the day, and once again during the
night, did not pray alone. The people kept
her company, and fed themselves with delight
on the manna which is hidden under
the words and mysteries of the divine liturgy.
Thus initiated into the sacred cycle
of the mysteries of the Christian year, the
faithful, attentive to the teachings of the
Spirit, came to know the secrets of eternal
life; and without any further preparation, a
Christian was not unfrequently chosen by
the bishops to be a priest, or even a bishop,
that he might go and pour out on the people
the treasures of wisdom and love which
he had drunk in at the very fountain-head.</p>

<p>"But for now many past ages, Christians
have grown too solicitous about earthly
things to frequent the holy <i>vigils</i> and the
mystical <i>hours</i> of the day. Long before the
rationalism of the sixteenth century became
the auxiliary of the heresies of that period
by curtailing the solemnity of the divine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[609]</a></span>
service, the days for the people's uniting
exteriorly with the prayer of the church
had been reduced to Sundays and festivals.
During the rest of the year, the solemn and
imposing grandeur of the liturgy was gone
through, and the people took no share in it.
Each new generation increased in indifference
for that which their forefathers in the
faith had loved as their best and strongest
food. Social prayer was made to give way
to individual devotion. Chanting, which is
the natural expression of the prayers and
even of the sorrows of the Church, became
limited to the solemn feasts. That was the
first sad revolution in the Christian world.</p>

<p>"But even then Christendom was still
rich in churches and monasteries, and there,
day and night, was still heard the sound of
the same venerable prayers which the Church
had used through all the past ages. So
many hands lifted up to God drew down
upon the earth the dew of heaven, averted
storms, and won victory for those who were
in battle. These servants of God, who
thus kept up an untiring choir that sang the
divine praises, were considered as solemnly
deputed by the people, which was still Catholic,
to pay the full tribute of homage and
thanksgiving due to God, his Blessed Mother,
and the saints. These prayers formed
a treasury which belonged to all. The faithful
gladly united themselves in spirit to
what was done. When any affliction, or
the desire to obtain a special favor, led them
to the house of God, they were sure to
hear, no matter at what hour they went,
that untiring voice of prayer which was for
ever ascending to heaven for the salvation
of mankind. At times they would give up
their worldly business and cares, and take
part in the office of the church, and all still
understood, at least in a general way, the
mysteries of the liturgy.</p>

<p>"Then came the <i>Reformation</i>, and, at the
onset, it attacked the very life of Christianity&mdash;it
would put an end to the sacrifice of
man's praise of his God. It strewed many
countries with the ruins of churches; the
clergy, the monks, and virgins consecrated
to God were banished or put to death; and
in the churches which were spared the divine
offices were not permitted. In other
countries, where the persecution was not so
violent, many sanctuaries were devastated
and irremediably ruined, so that the life
and voice of prayer grew faint. Faith, too,
was weakened; rationalism became fearfully
developed; and now our own age seems
threatened with what is the result of these
evils&mdash;the subversion of all social order.</p>

<p>"For, when the Reformation had abated
the violence of its persecution, it had other
weapons wherewith to attack the Church.
By these, several countries, which continued
to be Catholic, were infected with that
spirit of pride which is the enemy of prayer.
The modern spirit would have it that
<em>prayer is not action</em>&mdash;as though every good
action done by man were not a gift of God;
a gift which implies two prayers: one of
petition, that it may be granted; and another
of thanksgiving, because it is granted!
There were found men who said, <i>Let
us abolish all the festival days of God from
the earth</i>; and then came upon us that calamity
which brings all others with it, and
which the good Mardochai besought God to
avert from his nation, when he said, <i>Shut
not, O Lord, the mouths of them that sing to
thee!</i></p>

<p>"But, by the mercy of God, <i>we have not
been consumed</i>; there have been left remnants
of Israel; and the number of believers
in the Lord has increased. What is it
that has moved the heart of our God to
bring about this merciful conversion? Prayer,
which had been interrupted, has been resumed.
Numerous choirs of virgins consecrated
to God, and, though far less in number,
of men who have left the world to spend
themselves in the divine praises, make <i>the
voice of the turtle-dove heard in our land</i>.
This voice is every day gaining more power;
may it find acceptance from our Lord, and
move him to show the sign of his covenant
with us, the rainbow of reconciliation! May
our venerable cathedrals again reëcho those
solemn formulæ of prayer which heresy has
so long suppressed! May the faith and munificence
of the faithful reproduce the prodigies
of those past ages, which owed their
greatness to the acknowledgment, which all,
even the very civic authorities, paid to the
all-powerfulness of prayer!</p>

<p>"For a long time a remedy has been
devised for an evil which was only vaguely
felt. The spirit of prayer, and even prayer
itself, has been sought for in methods, and
prayer-books, which contain, it is true, laudable,
yea pious thoughts, but, after all,
only human thoughts. Such nourishment
cannot satisfy the soul, for it does not initiate
her into the prayer of the Church. Instead
of uniting her with the prayer of the
Church it isolates her. Of this kind are so
many of those collections of prayers and reflections
which have been published, under
different titles, during the last two hundred
years, and by which it was intended to edify
the faithful, and suggest to them, either for
hearing mass, or going to the sacraments,
or keeping the feasts of the church, certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[610]</a></span>
more or less commonplace considerations
and acts, always drawn up according to the
manner of thought and sentiment peculiar
to the author of each book. Each manual
had consequently its own way of treating
these important subjects. To Christians already
formed to piety, such books as these
would, indeed, serve a purpose, especially
as nothing better was offered to them; but
they had not influence sufficient to inspire
with a relish and spirit of prayer such as
had not otherwise received them.</p>

<p>"But this liturgical prayer would soon
become powerless were the faithful not
to take a real share in it, or, at least, not
to associate themselves to it in heart. It
can heal and save the world, but only on
the condition that it be understood. Be
wise, then, ye children of the Catholic
Church, and get that largeness of heart
which will make you pray the prayer of your
mother. Come, and buy your share in it,
fill up that harmony which is so sweet to
the ear of God. Where would you obtain
the spirit of prayer if not at its natural
source? Let us remind you of the exhortation
of the apostle to the first Christians:
<i>Let the peace of Christ rejoice in your hearts&mdash;let
the word of Christ dwell in you abundantly,
in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing
one another in psalms, hymns, and
spiritual canticles, singing in grace in your
hearts to God</i>."</p></blockquote>

<h2>HINTS ON HOUSEKEEPING</h2>

<p class="center">BY A GRANDMOTHER.</p>


<p>To one who has long been accustomed
to a retired and solitary life,
an occasional glimpse of the busy
world and its ways, a peep "through
the loopholes of the retreat," has a
relish and an interest scarcely to be
appreciated by the actual participants
in the turmoil and bustle of those
scenes.</p>

<p>In the quiet routine of rural life,
undisturbed by great excitements, and
to a great measure removed from the
influences of stirring events, it is almost
impossible to keep pace with
the changes that are constantly taking
place in the great outer world. I
think this must be more especially
true of our American society than of
any other nation. We are such a
restless race, so impatient of monotony,
so eager for excitement and variety,
that what is most in vogue to-day
is forgotten to-morrow, and the most
earnest pursuits of the present are
liable to be rapidly superseded by
others of a widely different nature.</p>

<p>After an absence of only a few
months from the social circle with
which it is my delight occasionally to
mingle, I often find myself much in
the predicament of poor Rip Van
Winkle, after his long repose in
"Sleepy Hollow," and dare not, upon
my reappearance, open my lips until
I have listened long enough to catch
the key-note, as it were, of the topics
at present engaging attention, lest my
remarks and inquiries may appear as
ill-timed and excite as much surprise
as did those of that redoubtable victim
of vagrancy and the broomstick.</p>

<p>Among all the changes that have
come over our American world, since
we who are now grandmothers could
call ourselves young, there are none
more utterly astounding&mdash;perhaps because,
having long claimed our careful
attention, they are more familiar
and interesting to us&mdash;than those embraced
in the household and home
economy. Now, although I am not
disposed to undervalue the improvements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[611]</a></span>
of modern times, or to decry
the advance of modern ideas in other
departments, I am wholly unwilling
to yield the palm to modern housekeeping.
In spite of every advantage
furnished by the superior appliances
of these days, and every facility offered
by the inventive genius of our
people in labor-saving machinery
adapted to each department of domestic
life, I insist that our housekeepers
are inferior in all the qualities
that contribute to the comfort of home
to their mothers, and that their mothers
were less efficient than their
grandmothers. There has been a
gradual but steady decline in the art
of housekeeping, and a more rapid
but equally constant increase in the
expense thereof. Indeed, this last
item looms up in dimensions and
glares upon us with an aspect nothing
less than appalling to dames like myself,
who cherish antiquated notions
on these subjects.</p>

<p>"Henry, why in the world do you
not marry?" I said the other day to
a highly-esteemed young friend, whom
I had known from his childhood, and
who is richly endowed, as I well know,
with every quality necessary to make
a home happy. "Why in the world
do you not marry? It is a positive
wrong to society, that so much domestic
virtue as you possess should
remain unappropriated. You are now
well established in business, with every
prospect of success, and you really
ought to be thinking of making a
home for yourself."</p>

<p>"I wish I dare indulge such an aspiration,"
he replied with something
very like a regretful sigh; "but, to
tell you the truth, such a step as taking
a wife to myself under my present
circumstances would be ruinous. My
business is indeed, as you say, well
established, and&mdash;within certain, not
very extensive, limits&mdash;prosperous.
By close attention and strict fidelity
to its interests, diligent industry, and
careful economy, I realize annually a
very comfortable income; not large,
but, under these conditions, quite
sure; as years advance, this will probably
increase slowly and surely.
Now, if I were to marry, just imagine
what a load of expense would be incurred
at once! You know as well
as I the manner of life I should be
required to adopt, by any young lady
of the class among whom I should
look for a wife; and I really am not
in a position to incur such a burden
now, nor can I hope to be for a long
time to come."</p>

<p>This was said in a tone of despondency
and deep feeling, and I could
not but sympathize with my young
friend, compelled thus reluctantly to
suppress the dearest aspirations of
youth; nor could I avoid deploring
the exigencies that constrain the greater
portion of worthy young men in
our country, to relinquish the hope
of a happy home of their own, which
would be their strongest stimulant to
exertion and their best shield against
temptation.</p>

<p>It is long since I have been in the
habit of witnessing the gambols of the
gay world; but I happened not long
since to peep in upon a sort of fandango
at the house of one of my
friends, and, bless my heart, what
costumes! My surprise would beggar
description. I happened to be
standing near the mistress of the
house, and remarked to her that I
was not aware this was to be a <em>fancy
party</em>.</p>

<p>"And it is not," she replied.</p>

<p>"But you do not mean to tell me,"
I exclaimed in dismay, "that these are
the ordinary costumes for full dress at
parties?"</p>

<p>"Of course they are. Why not?"
she very innocently answered.</p>

<p>I ventured no further remark or inquiry,
but retired with my own quiet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[612]</a></span>
cogitations into a silent corner. Presently
a sprightly young lady of whom
I am very fond, and who is foolish
enough to cherish a great fancy for
me, came tripping up to my retreat,
her face all shining with gayety and
goodness. "Tell me, my dear," said
I, "why you young ladies wear your
pockets outside your dress, and in
such an inconvenient place, and why
you wear your skirts pinned up at a
party, just as we used to wear them
when about our housework?"</p>

<p>"Oh! those are not our pockets;
they are <i>paniers</i>; and it is the present
style to loop up the skirts this way."</p>

<p>"But, my child, can you tell me
how many superfluous yards of silk
are required to make skirts in this
way, and to furnish these festoons?"</p>

<p>"We do not count by yards," said
she, laughing; "but this is not an
expensive dress. It cost only <em>eighty
dollars</em>, the making and all!" And
she glided away to join her young companions.
So much for the philosophy
of a young girl in a simple country
village!</p>

<p>"No wonder," thought I, "that
Harry does not dare to marry!"</p>

<p>Now here was this dear girl&mdash;lovely,
accomplished, beautiful, intelligent,
and fascinating&mdash;a perfect charm in
society, after her fashion; but a wife?
Why a man might as well marry a
butterfly!</p>

<p>There is certainly something sadly
"out of joint" in the times. The jarring
and jolting of domestic machinery
betrays loose screws, if not more
fatal defects, somewhere in its construction.
The subject is attracting
general attention, eliciting general
complaint, and calling forth the best
energies of many minds in its discussion.
Much talent has been engaged
in the consideration of evils and defects,
which it is asserted pervade
every branch of domestic economy
and every part of society. Remedial
measures which have recently been
proposed are also attracting much
notice.</p>

<p>Not long ago a learned judge, lamenting
the modern defects in female
education, concluded with the consoling
remark, "Yes, our girls are badly
educated; but our boys will never
find it out!"</p>

<p>Ah my learned friend! you see
our young Henrys, though they may
not detect the cause, are fully alive to
the consequences.</p>

<p>What are these defects, what their
remedy, and what the proper</p>


<h3>WORK FOR WOMEN.</h3>

<p>Now, it seems to me that every
mother who is blessed with a daughter
should begin with the first dawn
of reason to instil into that daughter's
mind the consciousness that she has
something to do&mdash;that there is <em>work</em>
awaiting every step of her advancing
progress from childhood to youth,
from youth to womanhood, and from
womanhood to old age.</p>

<p>The patronage of boarding-houses,
which are entirely antagonistic to the
first idea of a home, should be discarded.
The daughter should be required
to participate daily with her
mother in household cares and duties,
even while pursuing her studies.</p>

<p>Herein lies the difference between
"modern ideas" and the antique <i>régime</i>.
Here is the fault of the "century,"
so deplorable in its results, so
widely lamented; and here&mdash;by the
most culpable neglect to rear our
daughters in a manner to fit them for
the high responsibilities and duties of
<em>home</em>&mdash;has the equilibrium between
the "producer and consumer," so
much talked of, been lost.</p>

<p>Education, like charity, should begin,
be carried on, and be perfected at
home, or it can be nothing elsewhere.
The duties of women as "producers,"
in modern times, are identical with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[613]</a></span>
those of their grandmothers; and it is
only in the family, within the dear
and sheltered nook of home, that
they can find profitable and legitimate
exercise.</p>

<p>Under the ancient system&mdash;and it
certainly could show as noble results
as the modern mode has been able to
achieve&mdash;the wife was the queen of a
little kingdom, and her highest ambition
was to rule within its sacred precincts
wisely and well. If the resources
and revenues were scanty, her
study was so to manage the expenditures
as to leave a margin on the credit
side for future emergencies, or for increase
of capital. If God gave her
children, she accepted the inestimable
boon with heartfelt thanksgivings,
took up the holy office with all its tender
cares and duties, as the crown of
her glory, and presided with matronly
dignity over the best and highest interests
of the young immortals committed
to her keeping, training her
little ones diligently "in the way in
which they should walk." She welcomed
gracefully whatever adjuncts
were furnished by schools and books,
but never dreamed of abating her maternal
vigilance, or trusting to these
as substitutes for home culture. Her
children were daily questioned, their
proficiencies praised, their deficiencies
or indolence in their studies reproved.
Consequently she did not fall into that
other dream, too common in these
days, of going out from home to find
something to do, because schools and
systems had taken her children off her
hands, and removed them beyond the
scope of her jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Schools did not release her from
the duty of watching over the development
of their intellects. Sewing-machines
did not stitch their garments;
trained servants in every department
were not at hand to perform
the housework indifferently well.
Verily, between one interest and another,
our grandmothers had work
enough to do!</p>


<h3>WAS IT PROFITABLE?</h3>

<p>We think any young wife and mother
who will ask this question with
sincerity and thoughtfulness, arousing
the energies of her mind to the importance
of considering it well and arriving
at a true conclusion, will give an
affirmative reply. There is no sphere
in which a woman can be so profitable
a "producer" as at home, and
that simply by practising the old-fashioned
virtues of "looking well to
the ways of her household, and eating
not the bread of idleness." By regulating
carefully the consumption, she
becomes the most efficient and lucrative
"producer."</p>

<p>When every woman will accept
this truth in its widest sense, and act
accordingly, then, and not before,
will the balance-sheet between "producers
and consumers" be adjusted.
Then will the toiling husband be
matched by the industrious and frugal
wife. Then will he return after
the toils of the day, not to a palace
glittering in cold splendor, and rivalling
in the chilly magnificence of gew-gaws
and trinkets a jeweller's show-window,
but to a cozy and cheerful
home, where "books that are books"
abound, where the smile of an intelligent
companion greets his return, and
a sympathizing friend is ever ready to
enter into all his cares and perplexities,
to assist with wise counsels, and
encourage with brave words.</p>

<p>It is certain that there is great need
of a thorough change in the domestic
discipline of the homes in our country,
if a tithe of what is predicated as
to existing evils be true. If our young
women have really, as a general rule,
become so frivolous in their characters,
so fond of their ease, and so expensive
in their habits, that our prudent
young men dare not assume the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[614]</a></span>
burden of a family, or, in doing so,
can have no assurance that they are
providing for themselves the comforts
and the blessings which should be
embraced in the sacred inclosure of
home, the consequences to society
must be utterly ruinous. The family
is the foundation of society, and only
in well-ordered and happy homes can
its well-being and stability be established
and sustained.</p>


<h3>NIL DESPERANDUM.</h3>

<p>Deplorable as are the pictures which
are drawn, discouraging as are the
statements we daily hear of domestic
confusion and misery, it is not to be
admitted or believed that our American
women are so swallowed up in
a vortex of fashion and folly, or so
enfeebled by habits of indolence, that
they cannot be awakened from their
fatal dream.</p>

<p>There is really in our national character
too much intelligence, though
it may be slumbering; too much energy,
though it may be dormant through
apathy, to permit us to sink hopelessly
and helplessly into social chaos.
It is only necessary to awaken the
public mind to the importance of the
subject, and to arouse American women
to united and persevering efforts
to retrieve the past, and bring about
a better state of affairs in the future,
and the work of reform is on the sure
road to accomplishment. This is the
only "<em>coöperative</em>" agency from which
we may hope for beneficial results.
No new plans or patent machinery
will enable the wife, the mother, the
housekeeper, to shirk her duty or
transfer the irksome task to other
shoulders. She must simply "seek
out the old paths, and walk therein,"
humbly, diligently, at whatever sacrifice
of her own ease or endurance of
painful trials, which must always be
the heritage of the true woman, but
which, met and endured in the true
womanly spirit, are richer than earthly
treasures, and will secure rewards
more unfailing than earthly glories.</p>

<p>In no other way can this painful
domestic problem ever find a fitting
solution.</p>

<p class="center">TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN OF CONRAD VON BOLANDEN.</p>

<h2>ANGELA.</h2>


<h3>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

AVOWALS.</h3>

<p>In the same deep valley where the
brook rippled over the pebbles in its
bed, where the mountain sides rose
up abruptly, where the moss hung
from the old oaks, where Klingenberg
plucked the tender beard of the
young professor of history, took
place the meditated attack of the
doctor on the poison of materialism
which was destroying the body and
soul of Richard.</p>

<p>Slowly and carefully the doctor advanced,
as against an enemy who will
defend his position to the last. But
how was he astonished when, upon being
attacked, Frank showed no disposition
to defend that most highly-vaunted
doctrine of modern science&mdash;materialism.
This was almost as puzzling
to the doctor as the eternity of
matter. Tired of skirmishing, the
doctor set to work to close with the
enemy and strike him down.</p>

<p>"I have looked only cursorily at
the writings of the materialists; you
have studied them carefully; and you
will oblige me much if you would
give me the foundation on which the
whole structure of materialism rests."</p>

<p>"The materialistic system is very
simple," answered Frank. "Materialists
reject all existence that is not
sensibly perceptible. They deny the
existence of invisible and supersensible
things. There is no spirit in man
or anywhere else. Matter alone exists,
because matter alone manifests its
existence."</p>

<p>"I understand. The materialist
will only be convinced by seeing and
feeling. As a spirit is neither spiritual
nor tangible, then there is none. Is
it not so, friend Richard?"</p>

<p>"You have included in one sentence
the whole of materialism," said
Frank coolly.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand," said Klingenberg
hesitatingly, "how the materialists
can make assertions which are
untenable to the commonest understandings.
Why, thought can neither
be seen nor felt; yet it is an existence."</p>

<p>"Thought is a function of the
brain."</p>

<p>"Then it is incomprehensible how
the sensible can beget the supersensible.
How matter&mdash;the brain&mdash;can
produce the immaterial, the spiritual."</p>

<p>Richard was silent.</p>

<p>"At every step in materialism I
meet insurmountable difficulties," continued
the doctor. "I know perfectly
the organization of the human
body, as well as the function and purpose
of each part. The physician
knows the purpose of the lungs, heart,
kidneys, and stomach, and all the noble
and ignoble parts of the body.
But no physician knows the origin of
the activity of the organism. The
blood stops, the pulse no longer beats,
the lungs, kidneys, nerves, and all the
rest cease their functions. The man
is dead. Why? Because the activity,
the movement, the force is gone.
What then is this vivifying force?
In what does it consist? What color,
what taste, what form has it? No
physician knows. The vivifying principle
is invisible, intangible, perfectly
immaterial. Yet it exists. Therefore
the fundamental dogma of materialism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[618]</a></span>
is false. There are existences
which can neither be felt, tasted, nor
seen."</p>

<p>"The vivifying principle is also in
animals," said Richard.</p>

<p>"Certainly; and in them also intangible
and mysterious. Materialism cannot
even stand before animal life; for
even there the vivifying principle is an
immaterial existence."</p>

<p>"The materialist stumbles at the
existence of human spirit, because he
cannot get a conception of it."</p>

<p>"How could this be possible?"
cried the doctor. "The conception is
a picture in the mind, an apprehension
of the senses. Spiritual being is
as unapproachable by the senses as the
vivifying principle, of which also man
can form no conception. To deny
existence because you cannot have a
conception of it, is foolish. The blind
would have the same right to deny
the existence of colors, or the deaf
that of music. And who can have
a conception of good, of eternity, of
justice, of virtue? No one. These
are existences that do not fall under
the senses. To be logical, the materialist
must conclude that there is
nothing good, nothing noble, no justice;
for we have not yet seen nor felt
nor smelt these things. Virtuous actions
we can, of course, see; but these
actions are not the cause but the consequence,
not the thing working but
the thing wrought. As these actions
will convince every thinking man of
the existence of virtue and justice,
so must the workings of the spirit
prove its existence."</p>

<p>"Precisely," replied Frank. "Materialism
only surprises and captivates
one like a dream of the night. It
vanishes the moment it is seen. I
read the works of Vogt and Büchner
only for diversion; my object was
perfectly gained."</p>

<p>"You read for diversion! What did
you wish to forget?"</p>

<p>"Dark clouds that lowered over
my mind."</p>

<p>"Have you secrets that I, your old
friend and well-meaning adviser, should
not know?"</p>

<p>Frank was confused; but his great
respect for the doctor forced him to
be candid.</p>

<p>"You know my views of women.
When I tell you that Angela, the well-known
Angel of Salingen, has torn
these opinions up by the roots, you
will not need further explanation."</p>

<p>"You found Angela what I told
you? I am glad," said Klingenberg.
And his disputative countenance
changed to a pleasant expression. "I
suspected that the Angel of Salingen
made a deep impression on you. I
did not guess; I read it in large characters
on your cheeks. Have you
made an avowal?"</p>

<p>"No; it will never come to that."</p>

<p>"Why not? Are you ashamed to
confess that you love a beautiful
young lady? That is childish and simple.
There is no place here for shame.
You want a noble, virtuous wife.
You have Angela in view. Woo her;
do not be a bashful boy."</p>

<p>"Bashfulness might be overcome,
but not the conviction that I am unworthy
of her."</p>

<p>"Unworthy! Why, then? Shall I
praise you? Shall I exhibit your noble
qualities, and convince you why
you are worth more than any young
man that I know? You have not
Angela's religious tone; but the strong
influence of the wife on the husband
is well known. In two or three years
I shall not recognize in the ultramontane
Richard Frank the former materialist."
And the doctor laughed
heartily.</p>

<p>"It is questionable," said the young
man, "whether Angela's inclination
corresponds to mine."</p>

<p>"The talk of every true lover,"
said the doctor pleasantly. "Pluck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[619]</a></span>
the stars of Bethlehem, like Faust's
Grethe, with the refrain, 'She loves,
she loves not&mdash;she loves.' But you
are no bashful maiden; you are a
man. Propose to her. Angela's answer
will show you clearly how she
feels."</p>

<p>The doctor was scarcely in his
room when Richard's father entered.</p>

<p>"All as you foretold," said Klingenberg.
"Your son is cured of his
hatred of women by Angela. The
materialistic studies were not in earnest;
they were only a shield held up
against the coming passion. The love
question is so absorbing, and the sentiment
so strong, that Richard left
me near Frankenhöhe to hasten over
there. I expect from your sound
sense that you will place no obstacles
in the way of your son's happiness."</p>

<p>"I regret," said Frank coldly, "that
I cannot be of the same opinion with
you and Richard in this affair."</p>

<p>"Make your son unhappy?" said
Klingenberg. "Do you consider the
possible consequences of your opposition?"</p>

<p>"What do you understand by possible
consequences?"</p>

<p>"Melancholy, madness, suicide, frequently
come from this. I leave to-morrow,
and I hope to take with
me the assurance that you will sacrifice
your prejudice to the happiness
of Richard."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Among the numerous inhabitants
of Siegwart's yard was a hen with a
hopeful progeny. The little chicks
were very lively. They ran about
after insects till the call of the happy
mother brought them to her. Escaped
from the shell some few days
before, they had instead of feathers
delicate white down, so that the pretty
little creatures looked as though
they had been rolled in cotton. They
had black, quick eyes, and yellow
feet and bills. If a hawk flew in the
air and the mother gave a cry, the
little ones knew exactly what it meant,
and ran under the protecting wings
of the mother from the hawk, although
they had never seen one&mdash;had never
studied in natural history the danger
of the enemy. If danger were near,
she called, and immediately they were
under her wings. The whole brood
now stopped under the lindens. The
little ones rested comfortably near
the warm body of the mother. Now
here, now there, their little heads
would pop out between the feathers.
One smart little chirper, whose ambition
indicated that he would be the
future cock of the walk, undertook to
stand on the back of the hen and pick
the heads of the others as they appeared
through the feathers.</p>

<p>Angela came under the lindens,
carrying a vessel of water and some
crumbs in her apron for the little
ones. She strewed the crumbs on
the ground, and the old hen announced
dinner. The little ones set to work
very awkwardly. The old hen had
to break the crumbs smaller between
her bill. Angela took one of the
chickens in her hand and fondled it,
and carried it into the house. The
hen went to the vessel to drink and
the whole brood followed. It happened
that the one that stood on her
back fell into the water, and cried
loudly; for it found that it had got
into a strange element of which it had
no more idea than Vogt and Büchner
of the form of a spirit. At this critical
moment Frank came through the
yard. He saw it fluttering about in
the water, and stopped. The old hen
went clucking anxiously about the
vessel. And although she could
without difficulty have taken the
chicken out with her bill, yet she did
not do it. Richard observed this
with great interest; but showed no
desire to save the little creature, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[620]</a></span>
at the last gasp floated like a bunch
of cotton on the water.</p>

<p>Angela may have heard the noise
of the hen, for she appeared at the
door. She saw Frank standing near
the lindens looking into the vessel. At
the same time she noticed the danger
of one of her little darlings, and hastened
out. She took the body from
the water and held it sadly in her
hands.</p>

<p>"It is dead, the little dear," said
she sadly. "You could have saved
it, Herr Frank, and you did not do it."
She looked at Frank, and forgot immediately,
on seeing him, the object
of her regrets. The young man stood
before her so dejected, so depressed
and sad, that it touched her heart.
She knew what darkened his soul.
She knew his painful struggle, his
great danger, and she could have
given her life to save him. She was
moved, tears came into her eyes, and
she hastened into the house.</p>

<p>Siegwart was reading the paper
when his daughter hastened in such
an unusual way through the room and
disappeared.</p>

<p>This astonished him.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Angela?" he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>There was no answer. He was
about to go after her when Frank entered.</p>

<p>"I can give you some curious news
of the assessor," said the proprietor
after some careless conversation.
"The man is terribly enraged against
me and full of bad designs. The reason
of this anger is known to you."
And he added, "Angela is in the
next room, and she must know nothing
of his proposal."</p>

<p>Frank nodded assent.</p>

<p>"About ten paces from the last
house in Salingen," continued Siegwart,
"I have had a pile of dirt thrown
up. It was now and then sprinkled
with slops, to make manure of it.
Herr Hamm has made the discovery
that the slops smell bad; that it
annoys the inhabitants of the next
house; and he has ordered it to be
removed."</p>

<p>Richard shook his head disapprovingly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Herr Hamm will come
to the conclusion that, in the interest
of the noses, all like piles must be removed
from Salingen."</p>

<p>"But that is not all," said Siegwart.
"It has been discovered that the common
good forbids my keeping fowls,
because my residence is surrounded
by fields and vineyards, where the
fowls do great damage. The Herr
Assessor has had the goodness, accompanied
by the guards, to examine
personally the amount of destruction.
So I have got instructions either to
keep my fowls confined or to make
away with them."</p>

<p>"Mean and contemptible!" said
Frank.</p>

<p>Angela came into the room. Her
countenance was smiling and clear as
ever; but her swollen eyes did not
escape Richard's observation. She
greeted the guest, and sat down in
her accustomed place near the window.
Scarcely had she done this,
when Frank stood up, went toward
her, and knelt down before the astonished
girl.</p>

<p>"Miss, I have greatly offended you,
and beg your pardon."</p>

<p>Siegwart looked on in surprise&mdash;now
at his daughter, who was perplexed;
now at the kneeling young man.</p>

<p>"For God's sake! Herr Frank,
arise," said the confused Angela. She
was about to leave the seat, but he
caught her hand and gently replaced
her.</p>

<p>"If I may approach so near to
you, my present position is the proper
one. Hear me! I have deeply offended
you. I could with ease have
saved a creature that was dear to you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[621]</a></span>
and I did not do it. My conduct
has brought tears to your eyes&mdash;hurt
your feelings. When you went away
to regain your composure, and to show
your offender a serene, reconciled
countenance, it made my fault more
distressing. Forgive me; do not consider
me hard and heartless, but see
in me an unfortunate who forgets himself
in musing."</p>

<p>She looked into Frank's handsome
face as he knelt before her, in such
sadness, lowering his eyes like a guilty
boy, and smiled sweetly.</p>

<p>"I will forgive you, Herr Frank, on
one condition."</p>

<p>"Only speak. I am prepared for
any penance."</p>

<p>"The condition is, that you burn
those godless books that make you
doubt about the noblest things in
man, and that you buy no more."</p>

<p>"I vow fulfilment, and assure you
that the design of those books, which
you rightly call godless, is recognized
by me as a crime against the dignity
of man&mdash;and condemned."</p>

<p>"This rejoices no one more than
me," said she with a tremulous voice.</p>

<p>He stood up, bowed, and returned
to his former place.</p>

<p>"But, my dear neighbor, how did
this singular affair happen?" said the
proprietor.</p>

<p>Frank told him about the death of
the chicken.</p>

<p>"The love of the hen for her chickens
is remarkable. She protects them
with her wings and warns them of
danger, which she knows by instinct.
How easy would it have been for the
hen to have taken the young one
from the water with her bill&mdash;the
same bill with which she broke their
food and gave it to them. But she
did not do it, because it is strange
to her nature. This case is another
striking proof that animals act neither
with understanding nor reflection.
Acts beyond their instinct are impossible
to them. This would not be
the case, if they had souls."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The old servant stood with an
empty basket before the library of the
son, as he had stood before that of the
father. Büchner, Vogt, and Czolbe
fell into the fire. Jacob shook his
head and regretted the beautiful binding;
but the evil spirits between the
covers he willingly consigned to the
flames.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Again the cars stopped at the station;
again the two gentlemen stood
at the open window of the car to receive
their returning friends. The
travellers took a carriage and drove
through the street.</p>

<p>"Baron Linden has indeed gone
headlong into misery," said Lutz humorously.
"Eight days ago the young
pair swore eternal fidelity. It was
signed and sealed. Until to-day no
one could know that they were on the
brink of misery."</p>

<p>Richard remembered his remark
on the former occasion, and wondered
at his sudden change of opinion.</p>

<p>"I wish them all happiness," said he.</p>

<p>"Amen!" answered Lutz. "Richard,
however, considers happiness in
matrimony possible. So we may
hope that he will not always remain
a bachelor. How is the Angel of
Salingen? Have you seen her since
that encounter with the steer?"</p>

<p>"The angel is well," said Richard,
avoiding the glance of his friend.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by the 'Angel
of Salingen'?" said the father.</p>

<p>"Thereby I understand the unmarried
daughter of Herr Siegwart, of
Salingen, named Angela, who richly
deserves to be called the 'Angel of
Salingen.'"</p>

<p>Frank knit his brows darkly and
drummed on his knees.</p>

<p>"And the encounter with the
steer?" continued he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[622]</a></span></p>

<p>The professor related the occurrence.</p>

<p>"Ah! you did not tell me anything
of that," said the father, turning to
Frank. "An act of such great courage
deserves to be mentioned."</p>

<p>The carriage passed into the court
of a stately mansion. The servant
sprang from his seat and opened the
carriage-door. The professor looked
at his watch.</p>

<p>"Herr Frank, will you allow your
coachman to drive me to the university?
I must be at my post in ten
minutes. I cannot go on foot in that
time."</p>

<p>"With pleasure, Herr Professor."</p>

<p>"Richard," said the other friend,
"shall we meet at the opera to-night?"</p>

<p>"Scarcely. I must to-day enter
upon my usual business."</p>

<p>"Come, if possible. The evening
promises great amusement, for the
celebrated Santinilli dances."</p>

<p>The accustomed routine of business
began for Richard. He sat in the
counting-room and worked with his
habitual punctuality. Nevertheless
invidious spirits lured him toward Salingen,
so that the figures danced before
his eyes, words had no meaning,
and he was often lost in day-dreams.
The watchful father had observed this,
and was perplexed.</p>

<p>Richard's plan of studies also underwent
a change. He left the house
regularly at half-past five and returned
at half-past six. The father, desiring
to know what this meant, set the
faithful Jacob on the watch.</p>

<p>"Herr Richard," reported the spy,
"hears mass at the Capuchins."</p>

<p>Frank drummed a march on his
knees.</p>

<p>"So, so!" he hummed. "The ultramontanes
understand proselytizing.
They have turned the head of my
son. If I live long enough, I may
yet see him turn Capuchin, build a
cloister, and go about begging."</p>

<p>When Herr Frank entered the
counting-room, he found his son busy
at work. He stood up and greeted
his father.</p>

<p>"I have observed, Richard," he
began after a time, "that you go out
early every morning. What does it
mean?"</p>

<p>"I have imposed upon myself the
obligation of hearing mass every
morning."</p>

<p>"How did you come to take that
singular obligation upon yourself?"</p>

<p>"From the conviction that religion
is no empty idea, but a power that
can give peace and consolation in all
conditions of life."</p>

<p>"It is evident that you have breathed
ultramontane air. This church-going
is not forbidden&mdash;but no trifling
or fanatical nonsense."</p>

<p>"It is my constant care, father, to
give you no cause of uneasiness."</p>

<p>"I am rejoiced at this, my son; but
I must observe that a certain gloomy,
reserved manner of yours disturbs me.
Your conduct is exemplary, your industry
praiseworthy, your habits regular;
but you keep yourself too much
shut up; you do not give evening
parties any more. You do not visit
the concert-hall or theatre. This is
wrong; we should enjoy life, and not
move about like dreamers."</p>

<p>"I have no taste for amusements,"
answered Richard. "However, if
you think a change would be good, I
beg you to permit me to take a run
out to Frankenhöhe for a couple of
days."</p>

<p>"And why to Frankenhöhe? I
do not know any amusement there
for you."</p>

<p>"I have planted a small vineyard,
as you know, and I would like to see
how the Burgundies thrive."</p>

<p>Herr Frank was not in a hurry to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[623]</a></span>
give the permission. He thought and
drummed.</p>

<p>"You can go," he said resignedly.
"I hope the mountain air will cheer
you up."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Herr Siegwart had remarked the
same symptoms in his daughter that
Herr Frank had in his son; but Angela
did not give way to discontent.
She was always the same obedient
daughter. The poor and sick of Salingen
could not complain of neglect.
But she was frequently absent-minded,
gave wrong answers to questions, and
sought solitude. If Frank was mentioned,
she revived; the least circumstance
connected with him was interesting
to her. Her sharp-sighted
father soon discovered the inmost
thoughts and feelings of his daughter.
He thought of Herr Frank's ill-humor
toward him, and was disposed to regret
the hour that Richard entered
his house.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Burgundies at Frankenhöhe
were scarcely looked at. The young
man hastened to Salingen. He
found the landscape changed in a few
weeks. The fields had clothed themselves
in yellow. The wheat-stalks
bent gracefully under their load.
Everywhere industrious crowds were
in the fields. The stalks fell beneath
the reapers. Men bound the sheaves.
Wagons stood here and there. The
sheaves were raised into picturesque
stacks. The sun beamed down hot,
and the sweltering weather wrote on
the foreheads of the men, "Adam, in
the sweat of thy brow thou shalt eat thy
bread."</p>

<p>In the proprietor's house all was
still. The old cook sat beneath the
lindens, and with spectacles on her
nose tried to mend a stocking which
she held in her hand. She arose and
smiled on Richard's approach.</p>

<p>"They are all in the fields. We
have much work, Herr Frank. The
grain is ripe, and we have already gathered
fifty wagon-loads. I am glad
to see you looking so much better.
The family will also be glad. They
think a great deal of you&mdash;particularly
Herr Siegwart."</p>

<p>"Give them many kind greetings
from me. I will come back in the
evening."</p>

<p>"Off so soon? Will you not say
good-day to Miss Angela? She is in
the garden. Shall I call her?"</p>

<p>"No," said he after a moment's
reflection; "I will go into the garden
myself."</p>

<p>After unlatching the gate, he would
have turned back, for he became nervous
and embarrassed.</p>

<p>Angela sat in the arbor; her embroidery-frame
leaned against the table,
and she was busily working. As
she heard the creaking of footsteps on
the walk, she looked up and blushed.
Frank raised his hat, and when the
young woman stood up before him in
beauty and loveliness, his nervousness
increased, and he would gladly have
escaped; but his spirit was in the fetters
of a strange power, and necessity
supplied him with a few appropriate
remarks.</p>

<p>"I heard that the family were absent;
but I did not wish to go away
without saluting you, Miss Angela."</p>

<p>She observed the bashful manner
of the young man, and said kindly,
"I am glad to see you again, Herr
Frank," and invited him to sit down.
He looked about for a seat; but as
there was none, he had to sit on the
same bench with her.</p>

<p>"Do you remain long at Frankenhöhe?"</p>

<p>"Only to-day and to-morrow.
Work requires dispatch, and old custom
has so bound me to my occupation
that the knowledge of work to be
done makes me feel uneasy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[624]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you work every day regularly
in the counting-room?"</p>

<p>"I am punctual to the hours, for
the work demands regularity and order.
There are every day some hours
for recreation."</p>

<p>"And what is the most pleasant
recreation for you?"</p>

<p>"Music and painting. I like them
the best. But of late," he added hesitatingly,
"unavoidable thoughts press
on me, and many hours of recreation
pass in useless dreaming."</p>

<p>Angela thought of his former mental
troubles and looked anxiously in
his eyes.</p>

<p>"Now, you have promised me,"
she said softly, "to forget all those
things in those bad books that disturbed
your mind."</p>

<p>"The fulfilment of no duty was
lighter or more pleasant to me than
to keep my promise to you, Angela."</p>

<p>His voice trembled. She leaned
over her work and her cheeks glowed.
The delicate fingers went astray;
but Frank did not notice that the
colors in the embroidery were getting
into confusion. There was a long
pause. Then Frank remembered the
doctor's final admonition, "Be not
like a bashful boy; put aside all false
shame and speak your mind;" and he
took courage.</p>

<p>"I have no right to ask what disturbs
and depresses you," said she, in
a scarcely audible voice and without
moving her head.</p>

<p>"It is you who have the best right,
Angela! You have not only saved
my life, but also my better convictions.
You have purified my views,
and influenced my course of life. I
was deeply in error, and you have
shown me the only way that leads to
peace. This I see more clearly every
day. The church is no longer a
strange, but an attractive place to me.
All this you have done without design.
I tell you this because I think
you sympathize with me."</p>

<p>He paused; but the declaration of
his love hovered on his lips.</p>

<p>"You have not deceived yourself
as to my sympathy," she answered.
"The discovery that one so insignificant
as myself has any influence with
you makes me glad."</p>

<p>"O Angela! you are not insignificant
in my eyes. You are more than
all else on earth to me!" he cried.
"You are the object of my love, of my
waking dreams. If you could give
me your hand before the altar in fidelity
and love, my dearest wishes would
be realized."</p>

<p>She slowly raised her head, her modest
countenance glowed in a virginal
blush, and her eyes, which met Richard's
anxious look, were filled with
tears. She lowered her head, and
laid her hand in that of the young
man. He folded her in his arms,
pressed her to his heart, and kissed
her forehead. The swallows flew
about the arbor, twittered noisily, and
threatened the robber who was trying
to take away their friend. The sparrows,
through the leaves of the vines,
looked with wonder at the table where
Angela's head rested on the breast of
her affianced.</p>

<p>They arose.</p>

<p>"We cannot keep this from our
parents, Richard. My parents esteem
you. Their blessing will not be
wanting to our union."</p>

<p>Suddenly she paused, and stood silent
and pale, as though filled with a
sudden fear. Richard anxiously inquired
the cause.</p>

<p>"You know your father's opinion
of us," she said, disturbed.</p>

<p>"Do not be troubled about that.
Father will not object to my arrangements.
But even if he does, I am of
age, and no power shall separate me
from you."</p>

<p>"No, Richard; no! I love you as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[625]</a></span>
my life; but without your father's consent,
our union wants a great blessing.
Speak to him in love; beg him, beseech
him, but do not annoy him on
account of your selfishness."</p>

<p>"So it shall be. Your advice is
good and noble. As long as this difficulty
exists, I am uneasy. I will
therefore go back. Speak to your
parents; give them my kind greeting,
and tell them how proud I shall feel
to be acknowledged as their son." He
again folded her in his arms and hastened
away.</p>

<p>The old cook still sat under the lindens,
and the stocking lost many a
stitch as Frank, with a joyous countenance,
passed her without speaking,
without having noticed her. She
shook wonderingly her old gray head.</p>

<p>Angela sat in the arbor. Her work
lay idly on the table. With a countenance
full of sweetness she went to
her room, and knelt and prayed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Herr Frank looked up astonished,
as Richard, late in the evening, entered
his chamber.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, father," said he joyfully
and earnestly; "something has
happened of great importance to
me, and of great interest to you. I
could not delay an explanation, even
at the risk of depriving you of an
hour's sleep."</p>

<p>"Well, well! I am really interested,"
said Herr Frank, as he threw
himself back on the sofa. "Your explanation
must be something extraordinary,
for I have never seen you thus
before. What is it, then?"</p>

<p>"For a right understanding of my
position, it is necessary to go back to
that May-day on which we went to
Frankenhöhe. Your displeasure at
my well-grounded aversion to women
you will remember."</p>

<p>With childish simplicity he related
the whole course of his inner life and
trials at Frankenhöhe. He described
the deep impression Angela had made
upon him. He took out his diary
and read his observations, his stubborn
adherence to his prejudices, and
the victory of a virtuous maiden over
them. The father listened with the
greatest attention. He admired the
depth of his son's mind and the
noble struggle of conviction against
the powerful influence of error. But
when Richard made known what had
passed between himself and Angela,
Herr Frank's countenance changed.</p>

<p>"I have told you all," said Richard,
"with that openness which a son
owes to his father. From the disposition
and character of Angela, as you
have heard them, you must have learned
to respect her, and have been convinced
that she and I will be happy.
Therefore, father, I beg your consent
and blessing on our union."</p>

<p>He arose and was about to kneel,
when Herr Frank stopped him.</p>

<p>"Slowly, my son. With the exception
of what happened to-day, I am
pleased with your conduct. You
have convinced yourself of the injustice
of your opinion of women. You
have found a noble woman. I am
willing to believe that Angela is a
magnificent and faultless creature, although
she have an ultramontane father.
But my consent to your union
with Siegwart's daughter you will never
receive. Now, Richard, you can
without trouble find a woman that
will suit you, and who is as beautiful
and as noble-minded as the Angel of
Salingen."</p>

<p>"May I ask the reason of your refusal,
father?"</p>

<p>"There are many reasons. First,
I do not like the ultramontane spirit
of the Siegwart family. Angela is
educated in this spirit. You would
be bound to a wife whose narrow
views would be an intolerable burden."</p>

<p>"Pardon, father! The extracts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[626]</a></span>
from my diary informed you that I
have examined this ultramontane spirit
very carefully, and that I was
forced at last to correct my opinions
of the ultramontanes&mdash;to reject an unjust
prejudice."</p>

<p>"The stained glass of passion has
beguiled you into ultramontane sentiments;
and further, remember that
Siegwart is personally objectionable
to me." And he spoke of the failure
of the factory through Angela's father.</p>

<p>"Herr Siegwart has told me of
that enterprise, and, at the same time,
gave me the reasons that induced
him to prevent its realization. He
showed the demoralizing effects of
factories. He showed that the inhabitants
of that neighborhood support
themselves by farming; that the religious
sentiment of the country people
is endangered by Sunday labor and
other evil influences that accompany
manufacturing."</p>

<p>"And you approved of this narrow-mindedness
of the ultramontane?"
cried Frank.</p>

<p>"Siegwart's conduct is free from
narrow-mindedness. You yourself
have often said that faith and religion
had much to fear from modern manufactories.
If Siegwart has made great
sacrifices, if he has interfered against
his own interest in favor of faith and
morality, he deserves great respect
for it."</p>

<p>"Has it gone so far? Do you
openly take part with the ultramontane
against your father?"</p>

<p>"I take no part; I express frankly
my views," answered Richard tranquilly.</p>

<p>"The views of father and son are
very different, and we may thank
your intercourse with the ultramontanes
for it."</p>

<p>"Your acquaintance, father, with
that excellent family is very desirable.
You would soon be convinced that
you ought to respect them."</p>

<p>"I do not desire their acquaintance.
It is near midnight; go to rest, and
forget the hasty step of to-day."</p>

<p>"I will never regret what has taken
place with forethought and reflection,"
answered Richard firmly. "I
again ask your consent to the happiness
of your son."</p>

<p>"No, no! Once for all&mdash;never!"
cried Frank hastily.</p>

<p>The son became excited. He was
about to fly into a passion, and to
show his father that he was not going
to follow blind authority like an inexperienced
child, when he thought of
what Angela said, "Speak to your
father in love;" and his rising anger
subsided.</p>

<p>"You know, father," he said hesitatingly,
"that my age permits me to
choose a wife without reference to
your will. As the consent is withheld
without valid reasons, I might
do without it. But Angela has urgently
requested me not to act against
your will, and I have promised to
comply with her wishes."</p>

<p>"Angela appears to have more
sense than you. So she requested this
promise from you? I esteem the
young lady for this sentiment, although
she be a child of Siegwart,
who shall never have my son for a
son-in-law."</p>

<p>The young man arose.</p>

<p>"It only remains for me to declare,"
said he calmly, "that to Angela,
and to her alone, shall I ever belong
in love and fidelity. If you persevere
in your refusal, I here tell you,
on my honor, I shall never choose
another wife."</p>

<p>He made a bow and left the room.
It was long past midnight, and Herr
Frank was still sitting on the sofa,
drumming on his knees and shaking
his head.</p>

<p>"An accursed piece of business!"
said he. "I know he will not break
his word of honor under any circumstances.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[627]</a></span>
I know his stubborn head.
But this Siegwart, this clerical ultramontane
fellow&mdash;it is incompatible;
mental progress and middle-age darkness,
spiritual enlightenment and stark
confessionalism&mdash;it won't do. Angela
certainly is not her father. She is
an innocent country creature; does
not wear crinoline, dresses in blue
like a bluebell, has not a dainty stomach,
and has no toilette nonsense.
The nuns, together with perverted
views of the world, may, perhaps,
have taught her many principles that
adorn an honorable woman; but&mdash;but&mdash;"
And Herr Frank threw himself
back grumbling on the sofa.</p>

<p>On the following day Richard wrote
Angela a warm, impassioned letter.
The vow of eternal love and fidelity
was repeated. In conclusion, he spoke
of his father's refusal, but assured her
that his consent would yet be given.</p>

<p>Many weeks passed. The letters
of the lovers came and went regularly
and without interruption. She
wrote that her parents had not hesitated
a moment to give their consent.
In her letters Richard admired her
tender feeling, her dove-like innocence
and pure love. He was firm in his
conviction that she would make him
happy, would be his loadstar through
life. He read her letters hundreds
of times, and these readings were his
only recreation. He spoke not another
word about the matter to his father.
He kept away from all society.
He devoted himself to his calling, and
endeavored to purify his heart in the
spirit of religion, that he might approach
nearer to an equality with Angela.
The father observed him carefully,
and was daily more and more
convinced that a spiritual change was
coming over his son. Murmuringly
he endured the church-going, and
vexedly he shook his head at Richard's
composure and perseverance,
which he knew time would not
change. The more quietly the son
endured, the more disquieted Herr
Frank became. "Sacrifice your prejudices
to your son's happiness," he
heard the doctor saying; and he felt
ashamed when he thought of this advice.</p>

<p>"What cannot be cured must be
endured," he was accustomed to say
for some days, as often as he went
into his room. "The queer fellow
makes it uncomfortable for me; this
cannot continue; days and years pass
away. I am growing old, and the
house of Frank must not die out."</p>

<p>One morning he gave Richard
charge of the establishment. "I have
important business," said he. "I will
be back to-morrow."</p>

<p>The father smiled significantly as
he said this. Richard heard from
the coachman that Herr Frank took
a ticket for the station near Frankenhöhe.
He knew the great importance
to him of this visit, and prayed God
earnestly to move his father's heart
favorably. His uneasiness increased
hourly, and rendered all work impossible.
He walked up and down the
counting-room like a man who feared
bankruptcy, and expected every
moment the decision on which depended
his happiness for life. He
went into the hall where the desks of
the clerks stood in long rows. He
went to the desks, looked at the writing
of the clerks, and knew not what
he did, where he went, or where he
stood.</p>

<p>The next day Herr Frank returned.
Richard was called to the library,
where his father received him with a
face never more happy or contented.</p>

<p>"I have visited your bride," he began,
"because I had a curiosity to
know personally the one who has
converted my son to sound views of
womankind. I am perfectly satisfied
with your taste, and also with myself;
for I have become reconciled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[628]</a></span>
with Siegwart, and find that he is as
willing to live with his neighbors in
harmony as in discord. You now
have my blessing on your union. The
marriage can take place when you
please; only it would please me if it
came off as soon as possible."</p>

<p>Richard stood speechless with emotion,
which so overcame him that tears
burst from his eyes. He embraced
his father, kissed him tenderly, and
murmured his thanks.</p>

<p>"That will do, Richard," said Herr
Frank, much affected. "Your happiness
moves me. May it last long.
And I do not doubt it will; for Angela
is truly a woman the like of whom
I have never met. Her character is
as clear and transparent as crystal;
and her eyes possess such power, and
her smile such loveliness, that I fear
for my freedom when she is once in
the house."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Crisp, cold weather. The December
winds sweep gustily through the
streets of the city, driving the well-clad
wanderer before them and sporting
with the weather-vanes. A carriage
stops before the door of the
Director Schlagbein. Professor Lutz
steps out and directs the driver to
await him.</p>

<p>Emil Schlagbein, Richard's unhappy
married friend, had moved his
easy-chair near the stove and leaned
his head against its back. He looked
as though despair had seized him
and thrown him into it. Hasty steps
were heard in the ante-room, and Lutz
stood before him.</p>

<p>"Still in your working-clothes, Emil?
Up! the tea-table of the Angel of
Salingen awaits us."</p>

<p>"Pardon me; my head is confused,
my heart is sad; grief wastes my life
away."</p>

<p>"War&mdash;always war; never peace!"
said Lutz. "I fear, Emil, that all the
fault is not with your wife. You are
too sensitive, too particular about
principles. Man must tolerate, and
not be niggardly in compliance. Take
old Frank as a model. With Angela
entered ultramontanism into his house.
Frank lives in peace with this spirit&mdash;even
on friendly terms. Angela reads
him pious stories from the legends of
the saints. He goes with her to church,
where he listens with attention to the
word of God. He hears mass as
devoutly as a Capuchin; not to say
any thing of Richard, who runs a
race with Angela for the prize of piety.
Could you not also make some
sacrifice to the whims of your wife?"</p>

<p>"Angela and Ida&mdash;day and night!"
said the director bitterly. "The two
Franks make no sacrifice to female
whims. They appreciate her exalted
views, they admire her purity, her unspeakable
modesty, her shining virtues.
The two Franks acted reasonably
when they adopted the principles
that produced such a woman. Angela
never speaks to her husband in defiance
and bad temper. If clouds gather
in the matrimonial heaven, she
dissipates them with the breath of
love. Is the sacrifice of a wish wanted?
Angela makes it. Is her pure
feeling offended by Richard's faults?
She kisses them away and raises him
to her level. My wife&mdash;is she not
just the opposite in every thing? Is
she not quick-tempered, bitter, loveless,
extravagant, and stiff-necked?
Has she a look&mdash;I will not say of
love&mdash;but even of respect for me?
Do not all her thoughts and acts look
to the pleasures of the toilette, the
opera, balls, and concerts? O my
poor children! who grow up without
a mother, in the hands of domestics.
How is any concession possible here?
Must not my position, my self-respect,
the last remnant of manly dignity
go to the wall?"</p>

<p>"Your case is lamentable, friend!
Your principles and those of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[629]</a></span>
wife do not agree. Concession to
the utmost point of duty, joined with
prudent reform in many things, may,
perhaps, bring back harmony and a
good understanding between you.
You praise Angela: follow her example.
She abominates the air of
the theatre. The opera-glasses of the
young men levelled at her offend
her deeply, and bring to her angelic
countenance the blush of shame.
Her fine religious feeling is offended
at many words, gestures, and dances
which a pious Christian woman should
not hear and see. Yet she goes to
the opera because Richard wishes
it. Her husband will at last observe
this heroism of love, and sacrifice the
opera to it. What Angela cannot
obtain by prayers and representations,
she gains by the all-conquering
weapons of love. In like manner
and for a like object yield to your
wife. She is, at least, not a firebrand.
Love must overcome her stubbornness."</p>

<p>Schlagbein shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>"A father cannot do what is inconsistent
with paternal duty," said
he. "Shall I join in the course of
my wife? Whither does this course
lead? To the destruction of all family
ties, to financial bankruptcy&mdash;to
dishonor. For home my wife has no
mind, no understanding. My means
she throws carelessly into the bottomless
pit of pleasure-seeking and love of
dress. She does not think of the future
of her children. Every day brings to
her new desires for prodigality. If her
wishes are fulfilled, ruin is unavoidable.
If they are not fulfilled, she sits
ill-humored and obstinate in her room,
and leaves the care of the house to
her domestics, and the children to the
nurses. How often have I consented
to her vain desire for show, only
to see her extravagant wishes thereby
increased. She is without reason."</p>

<p>The unfortunate man's head sunk
upon his breast. Lutz stood still
without uttering a word.</p>

<p>"Yes, Angela is a noble woman,"
continued Emil, "she is the spirit
of order, the angel of peace and love.
Just hear Richard's father. He revels
in enthusiasm about her. 'My Richard
is the happiest man in the world,'
said he to me lately. 'I myself must
be thankful to him for his prudent
choice. Abounding in every thing,
my house was empty and desolate
before Angela came; but now every
thing shines in the sun of her orderly
housekeeping, of her tender care. Although
served with fidelity, I have
been until the present almost neglected.
But now that the angel hovers
over me, observes my every want, and
with her smile lights my old age, I
am perfectly happy.' Has my wife
a single characteristic of this noble
woman?"</p>

<p>"Angela is unapproachable in the
little arts that win the heart and drive
away melancholy," said Lutz. "A few
weeks ago, Herr Frank came home one
day from the counting-room all out
of sorts. He sat silently in his easy-chair
drumming on his knee. Angela
noticed his ill-humor. She sought
to dissipate it&mdash;to cheer him; but she
did not succeed. She then arose, and,
going to him, said with unspeakable
affection, 'Father, may I play and
sing for you the "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Lied der Kapelle?</span>"'
Herr Frank looked in her
face, and smiled as he replied, 'Yes,
my angel.' When her sweet voice
resounded in the next room in beautiful
accord with the accompaniment,
which she played most feelingly, the
old man revived and joined in her
song with his trembling bass."</p>

<p>"How often we have twitted Richard
with his views of modern women,"
said Emil. "It was his cool judgment,
perhaps, that saved him from a
misfortune like mine."</p>

<p>Just then a carriage stopped before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[630]</a></span>
the house. Emil went uneasily to
the window, and Lutz followed him.
Bandboxes and trunks were taken
from the house. The professor looked
inquiringly at his friend, whose
hand appeared to tremble as it rested
on the window-glass.</p>

<p>"What does this mean, Emil?"</p>

<p>"My wife is going to her aunt's
for an indefinite time. She leaves
me to enjoy the pleasures of Christmas
alone. The children also remain
here; they might be in her way."</p>

<p>The professor pitied his unhappy
friend.</p>

<p>"Emil," said he, almost angrily,
"it is for you to determine how a
man should act in regard to the freaks
and caprices of his wife. But you
should not steep yourself in gall, even
though your wife turn into a river of
bitterness. Drive away sadness and
be happy. Do not let your present
humor rob you of every thing. Forget
what you cannot change."</p>

<p>A beautiful woman approached the
carriage. Schlagbein turned away
from the sight. Lutz observed the
departing wife and mother. She did
not look up at the window where her
husband was. She got into the carriage
without even saying farewell.
She sat in the midst of bandboxes,
surrounded by finery and tinsel; and
as the wheels rolled over the pavement,
the director groaned in his
chair.</p>

<p>"A happy journey to you, Xantippe!"
cried the angry professor.
"Emil, be a man. Dress yourself; forget
at the Angel of Salingen's your
domestic devil."</p>

<p>Schlagbein moved his head disconsolately.</p>

<p>"What have the wretched to do
in the home of the happy? There I
shall only see more clearly that I suffer
and am miserable."</p>

<p>Lutz, out of humor, threw himself
into the carriage. With knitted brows
he buried himself in one of its corners.
That professional head was
perplexed with a question which ordinary
men would have quickly seen
through, and settled. Frank's happiness
and Schlagbein's misery stood
as two irrefutable facts before the
mind of the professor. Now came
the question, Why this happiness, why
this misery? The dashing Ida he
had known for years; also her enlightened
views of life, and her flexible
principles, perfectly conformable
to the spirit of progress. Whence, then,
the dissoluteness of her desires, the
bitterness of her humor, the heartlessness
of the wife, the callousness of
the mother?</p>

<p>The professor continued his musing.
He gave a scrutinizing glance at the
marriages of all his acquaintances.
Everywhere he found a clouded sky,
and, in the semi-darkness, lightning
and thunder. Only one marriage
stood before him bright and clear in
the sunlight of happiness, in the raiment
of peace, and that was ultramontane.
That ultramontane principles
had produced this happiness and
peace, the professor's industrious mind
saw with clearness. He raised his
head and said solemnly, "Marriage
is an image of religion. It proceeds
from the lips of God, and is perfected
at the altar. The marriage duties
are children of the religious sentiment,
fetters of the divine law. Ida
was faithful and true so long as it
agreed with the longings of her heart.
But with the cooling of affection died
love and fidelity. She recognizes no
religious duty, because she has progressed
to liberty and independence.
From this follows with striking clearness
the incompatibility of Christian
marriage with the spirit of the age.
Marriage will be a thing of the past
as soon as intellectual maturity conquers
in the contest with religion.
Sound sense, liberty of emotion and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[631]</a></span>
inclination will supplant the terrible
marriage yoke."</p>

<p>The professor paused and examined
his conclusion. It smiled upon
him like a true child of nature. It
clothed itself in motley flesh, and passed
through green meadows and shady
forests. It pointed encouragingly to
the beasts of the field and the birds
of the air, long in possession of intellectual
maturity. Sensual marriages,
intended to last only for weeks or
months, danced around the professor.
Cannibal hordes, who extended to
him their brotherly paws and claws,
pressed about him. In astonishment,
he contemplated his conclusion; it
made beastly grimaces, knavish and
jeering, and he dashed into fragments
the provoking mockery.</p>

<p>In strong contrast to the animal
kingdom, stood before him again the
Christian marriage. He cunningly
tried to give his new conclusion human
shape; but here the carriage
stopped, and the speculation vanished
before the clear light in the house of
the "Angel of Salingen."</p>

<h2>THE LETTER OF MR. E. S. FFOULKES.</h2>


<p>The religious controversies of the
last three centuries have given birth
to many new and strange things, but
scarcely to any thing more wonderful
than the letter of Mr. E. S. Ffoulkes
to Archbishop Manning, entitled <i>The
Church's Creed or the Crown's Creed</i>.
It is hard to discern the precise mental
condition of the author, or the
temper with which he writes; while
the whole letter is a bundle of misstatements
and misunderstandings, calculated
to produce an impression only
upon the ignorant or prejudiced reader.
It has been used in this country
as an argument against the Catholic
Church by the advance-guard of
Episcopalians, whose sparse ranks are
daily depleted by conversions to
Rome. It has more than once happened
that individuals even in high
position have proved unfaithful, and
we know of one or two converts to the
church for whom the yoke of Christ
proved too heavy. Nothing is more
natural than to hold up these examples
to the doubtful and the wavering
as warnings. "Here is one who
has tried the Roman communion
and found it oppressive to his heart,
or irreconcilable with his views of
Christianity. Hesitate long before
you take the step which he found
occasion to regret." Such a warning
is not without effect upon minds so
tempted and anxious as are those
of Protestants, when, called by conscience,
they forsake the associations
of childhood and accept for the first
time, in the spirit of obedience, a
religion which God has revealed to
faith alone. We have known some
to be deterred from the great step by
such warnings, which are purely personal,
and hardly merit the name
of arguments. For surely individual
experiences are not to be taken as the
basis of any reasoning. They are
good only as far as the person concerned
may be deemed an infallible
criterion of right or wrong. Every
one is liable to mistake or positive
error, and while there have been a
few dissatisfied Catholics, and a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[632]</a></span>
few concerts who have regretted the
step they took, there have been many
more who have daily found new cause
to thank God for the peace they have
experienced in the old faith. If the
testimony of individuals is to be taken,
we have the preponderance of argument
in our favor. Defections from
our ranks will never even approximate
to an equality in moral weight
with the accessions, nor ever furnish
any plausible objection against the
invincible demonstration of the authority
of the church. We do not deny
that difficulties may be raised which
it may require time and patience to
remove, nor that there are oftentimes
trials which prove the sincerity of
every individual believer. But there
are no <em>logical</em> objections to the claims
of an authority which professes to be
divine, and gives to the honest mind
just grounds for its high pretensions.
The defection of Mr. E. S. Ffoulkes,
or of many others like him, is in itself
no argument whatever, and cannot be
taken as any thing conclusive against
us, any more than can the treason of
Judas Iscariot. If he, or any other
adversary, will try in a manly way to
confute the arguments by which we
substantiate our position, let us listen
with patience and candor, and
give to his reasonings the attention
which they merit. Has Mr. Ffoulkes
done this in the letter before us, and
what answer shall Catholics make to
his attack? The full and complete
replies which have been made to his
pamphlet in England may not have
reached many here whom his assertions
have surprised, and therefore it
may be well to give room in these
pages to a brief discussion of the
charges which he makes against the
Catholic Church.</p>

<p>They resolve themselves into the
following:</p>

<p>1. The pope allowed the civil power
to make an alteration in the creed&mdash;a
thing distinctly forbidden by the
Fourth General Council.</p>

<p>2. The pope afterward altered the
creed on his own authority.</p>

<p>3. He made use of the forged Isidorian
decretals to build up a power
which he did not possess in earlier
ages.</p>

<p>4. He even inspired the Crusades
for the purpose of putting down the
patriarchal sees of the east and exalting
his own dignity, thus showing himself
to be a man of blood.</p>

<p>5. The fruits of faith, on the testimony
of Mr. Ffoulkes's experience, are
greater in the Anglican Church than
they are in the Catholic communion;
therefore the former is more truly a
church than the latter.</p>

<p>The inferences to be drawn from
these charges, if they could be substantiated,
would be, that the pope
has been very wicked, and has made
himself liable to excommunication,
and that the see of Rome is to blame
for all the divisions of the church.
This produces a sad ecclesiastical dilemma;
for if the supreme pontiff be
excommunicated, who will take his
place, and where shall we find the
true body of Christ?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Rome," says Mr. Ffoulkes, "has abundantly
proved, during the last thousand
years, that she can be a negligent, hesitating,
fickle, self-seeking, hypocritical guide
to others, <em>even where the faith is concerned</em>."</p></blockquote>

<p>Let us examine these fearful charges,
one by one, and then perhaps we
may have time to notice some singular
assertions which are scattered
through the letter, though they have
nothing to do with the main argument.</p>

<p>1. "The Fourth General Council
set forth a creed in which the perfect
doctrine was taught concerning the
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Then
it decreed that it was lawful for nobody
to propose or teach others another
faith. Those who should dare
to do it, if bishops or clergy, were to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[633]</a></span>
be deposed; if laymen, to be anathematized."
Now, in violation of this
canon, one King Reccared, in Spain,
in the year 589, did ignorantly or
wilfully put the procession of the
Holy Ghost from the Son into the
Nicene Creed, and sing the addition
in his private chapel. After him it
appears that Charlemagne committed
the same offence, and the pope, though
he objected to the proceeding, did not
stop it. The conclusion, therefore, is
that, even though this doctrine be
true, the civil power, or "the crown in
council," defined it; and secondly, that
the Roman pontiff is worthy of deposition
because he winked at this disobedience
to a decree of the &oelig;cumenical
council. We consider this whole
charge as rather trivial, and as already
answered by the words of Mr. Ffoulkes
himself. He admits that the popes,
while always defending the doctrine as
true, did not approve the addition to
the creed in the way in which it took
place. It was, however, an expression
of an orthodox dogma which
came spontaneously from the people
and bishops, in which they were seconded
by their rulers. The papal
objection to the movement was manifestly
on the ground that additions to
the creed should come from the proper
authority, and that the precedent of
Reccared was dangerous in practice.
To say that the civil power was the
tribunal which settled this doctrine,
is to say something supremely ridiculous,
when the very words of the objector
show that the whole movement
came from the ecclesiastical body.
Catholics believe that the procession
of the Holy Ghost from the Son was
always a part of the deposit of faith,
and that its expression in the symbols
of the church was only the confession
of a dogma ever at least implicitly
professed. When the head of
the church by his supreme authority
placed this doctrine in the creed&mdash;which
he had, according to our belief,
an undoubted right to do&mdash;he did
not sanction the action of Reccared
or Charlemagne, although he certainly
gave his infallible approval to
the dogma. We think this proceeding
of the "crown in council" a very
harmless one. Would that Elizabeth
had been as innocent in regard to
the church which she established!</p>

<p>It seems, then, that the pope did
not allow the thing of which our objector
complains, and so charge the
first falls to the ground.</p>

<p>2. "The Roman pontiff, however,
did himself alter the creed, and thus
break the canon of the Council of
Ephesus." We admit the gravamen
of this accusation. The pope did, in
answer to the wish of the great majority
of the Christian world, place
the "<i>Filioque</i>" in the Nicene symbol,
or sanction its insertion. But three
questions arise, the reply to which
will settle very clearly the whole difficulty.
What is the true meaning
of the Ephesine canon to which Mr.
Ffoulkes so often refers? Is the doctrine
of the procession of the Holy
Ghost from the Son a true doctrine?
Did the pontiff go beyond his authority
in allowing its introduction into
the creed?</p>

<p>In the first place, we find that our
objector has put a singular and most
impossible construction upon the seventh
canon of the Council of Ephesus,
which forms the one string upon
which he harps with such a dissonant
monotony. He interprets that canon
to forbid any after definitions of faith,
and to altogether abdicate the infallibility
of the church. In his view the
Council of Chalcedon takes up the
same theme, and virtually renounces
for all time the power which Christ
left on earth to teach and decide in
questions of doctrine. It is evident
to any sane person that the church
could not have thus renounced its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[634]</a></span>
own gifts, and practically voted itself
out of existence. And facts beyond
all question prove that such an
idea never entered into the heads of
the fathers of Ephesus or Chalcedon.
The Roman pontiff, as the head of
the Catholic Church, and the councils
which have been assembled under
his direction, have ever dealt with
heresy as did the first five councils,
and have even made, as time rendered
it necessary, fresh definitions of
faith. By Mr. Ffoulkes's construction
of the canons, the popes and all the
western bishops have been deposed
and excommunicated since the Fifth
General Council.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>The simple truth is, that the Ephesine
canon only forbade any one to
bring in a faith <em>contrary</em> to the one
already defined, and never dreamed
of denying the office of the church to
do for future ages what the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ecclesia
docens</i> was then doing for its own
times. The words of the council are,
"It shall be lawful for no one to put
forth another faith than that defined
by the Fathers of Nice," "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alteram
fidem nemini licere proferre, præter definitam
a Sanctis Patribus qui in Nicæâ
cum Sancto Spiritu congregati fuerunt.</i>"
Any person not bewildered by religious
eccentricities can easily see that
this canon, in the first place, only refers
to any denial of the creed of
Nice; and, secondly, that it has in
view the actions of private individuals,
and in no way that of the church collectively
or its supreme ruler. Mr.
Ffoulkes then harps upon the creations
of his own fancy, and the legitimate
consequence of his conclusions
is the annihilation of the whole ecclesiastical
body, and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">reductio ad absurdum</i>.</p>

<p>But is the doctrine of the procession
of the Holy Ghost from the Son
true or false, according to authorities
which even our objector considers
adequate? Those who are best acquainted
with patristic theology tell us
that this doctrine was always taught
by both eastern and western fathers,
though the mode of expression might
differ. The Greeks afterward misunderstood
the Latin "<i>Filioque</i>" as if in
the act of spiration the Father and
the Son were as two distinct principles.
The Latins, however, objected
to the preposition "per," as if in the
eternal act the Son were only an instrument
or canal. The dogma that
the Holy Ghost proceeds eternally
from the Father and the Son as from
one principle, and in one action, was
unquestionably the belief of the early
church. Pope Hormisdas, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 521,
seventy years before the conversion
of Reccared, thus writes to the emperor,
"It is known to all that the Holy
Ghost proceeds from the Father
and the Son under one substance
of the Deity." The same doctrine is
clearly stated in the synodical epistle
of St. Cyril of Alexandria. There is
no necessity in this place to refer to
other authorities, which are very numerous.
The Roman pontiff, acting,
as Catholics believe, in his capacity
as the head of the church, allowed
this dogma to be confessed in the
Constantinopolitan creed; and afterward
the Synod of Florence, at which
Greek bishops were present, solemnly
defined it. The action in this matter
of the holy see is very simply stated.
It is hard to say at what precise time
the "<i>Filioque</i>" was first inserted in the
symbol of faith. It seems to have
been used in Spain in the time of
Reccared, and thence to have passed
into Germany, Gaul, and Italy.
The objection of the pope to its
introduction in the first instance was,
that it was done by private individuals
and without authority. Thus, St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[635]</a></span>
Leo III., while commanding the doctrine
to be taught, orders its ejection
from the creed only on this ground.
So much is taught us by Mr. Ffoulkes
himself. At last, when its use became
general and was demanded by
the consent of all, Benedict VIII.
gave to it his supreme sanction.</p>

<p>The question now arises, if the Roman
pontiff exceeded his authority in
this action? By the testimony of
fathers and councils, we are certain
that he only sanctioned the confession
of a doctrine received by the early
church, and solemnly defined by later
days as a part of the original deposit
of faith, and as contained in the revelation
of the mystery of the Holy
Trinity. Had he the right thus to act
in controversies of faith? If he had
not, then not in this instance alone,
but in many others has he gone beyond
the bounds of his authority, and
objectors might as well find fault with
every pope from St. Peter down as to
weary themselves over a single fact
of history. The popes have always
claimed the right thus to act, and the
Christian world has yielded it to them,
and Catholics believe that they have
it from Christ. According to the Catholic
doctrine, the papacy is essential
to the constitution of the church.
There could no more be a church
without the pope than a man without
ahead. Writers like Mr. Ffoulkes do
not seem to comprehend this, and so,
taking for granted that which should
be proved, indulge in much self-complacency.
We pass on, then, to examine
whether the Roman pontiffs
owe any of the power which they
exercised to the forged decretals of
Isidore.</p>

<p>3. It is now pretty well settled that
the Isidorian collection of canons had
their origin in France, and not at
Rome, and that they were framed not
in the interest of the holy see, whose
powers were unquestioned, but in the
interest of the bishops. The decretals
of the popes and of the &oelig;cumenical
councils formed the canon law of the
church; and the first code of canons
which received any kind of official
sanction at Rome was that of Dionysius
in the sixth century. Whenever
the need of a new rule was felt, the
pontiffs legislated by their decretals,
the originals of which were preserved
in the papal archives. That these
decretals had full authority, appears
by the epistles of Celestine I. and
Leo the Great, and from the preface
of Dionysius to his collection. The
false decretals of Isidore began to be
circulated about the year 853, and at
first attracted little attention. Pope
Nicholas I., in a letter to Hincmar of
Rheims, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 863, commanded that
"no one should dare to pronounce a
judgment except in accordance with
the canons of Nicæa, and of the
other councils, and in agreement with
the decrees of the Roman pontiffs
Siricius, Innocent, Zosimus, Celestine,
Boniface, Leo, Hilary, Gregory, and
others, saving in all things the rights
of the apostolic see."</p>

<p>He makes no reference to the decretals
of Isidore, which were then
gaining acceptance, and certainly never
thought of basing his authority
upon them. These decretals may be
reduced to three classes: first, the
genuine canons or decrees of popes;
second, those which were substantially
genuine; third, those which were
wholly spurious. "This last class,"
says the <i>American Cyclopædia</i>, "only
contained what already existed.
The evil done by this forgery was
to history and erudition, and not
to the discipline of the church."
They were in accordance with the
recognized ecclesiastical system, and
good counterfeits of the true decretals.
It was not wonderful, therefore,
that they should have gradually come
into use, as a genuine collection of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[636]</a></span>
the early code of the church. For
two centuries after their first appearance,
they remained neglected by the
popes, and apparently unknown to
them. With the exception of one or
two quotations by Hadrian II. and
Stephen IV., no one of the pontiffs
referred to them before the middle of
the eleventh century. After this period,
when they were generally received,
and no doubt was entertained of
their authenticity, the popes began to
quote them with the same freedom
as was used in the case of the Hadrianic
collection.</p>

<p>We remark, therefore, that the forgery
was neither favored nor patronized
by the Roman pontiffs; and secondly,
that the false decretals gave
to the pope no power which he did
not already possess, and that by universal
consent. For the proof of the
latter assertion we need only cite one
or two authorities.</p>

<p>In the first place, one must be endowed
with a marvellous credulity to
believe that a private collection of
canons could have had the power to
convert the bishop of Rome from a
pastor of a particular city or country
into the ruler of the whole church,
the possessor of prerogatives before
unknown to the Christian world. And
the marvel is increased when we
consider that this great change must
have taken place without any protest
by the patriarchs or councils who
were thus called upon to pay obedience
to a new ecclesiastical superior.
He that can believe this can believe
any thing, no matter how absurd it
may be. The truth is, that the false
decretals could not have obtained so
easy acceptance and universal recognition
if they had not been in accordance
with the received doctrine and
constitution of the church.</p>

<p>In the second place, the careful
study of the earlier &oelig;cumenical councils
will persuade any honest mind
that the papal supremacy was firmly
established in the heart of Christendom.
The Synod of Sardica solemnly
acknowledged the supreme authority
of the Roman pontiff; and in so
doing it did not constitute any new
order of things, but simply recognized
a fact of divine institution. No council
ever pretended to give any power
to the apostolic see, but simply to
enunciate, as belonging to the very
constitution of the church, the rights
and dignity given to St. Peter and his
successors from Christ. Four hundred
years before the forgery of the
decretals, Innocent I. writes, in accordance
with the canon law of his age,
"If weighty matters come to be discussed,
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">causæ majores</i>,) they are to
be referred to the apostolic see after
the judgment of the bishops, according
as the synod has established and
the holy custom requires." In thus
claiming the prerogatives of the Roman
see the pontiffs are all of one accord
from the earliest day. The code
of Justinian declares, "We do not allow
that any thing which concerns the
affairs of the church should pass unreferred
to his blessedness the Roman
pontiff, for he is the head of all the
holy priests of God." Thus, Gelasius
in his decree at the Council of Rome,
494, says, "The holy Roman Catholic
and Apostolic Church was placed
over all the churches by no synod, but
obtained the primacy by the voice of
our Lord and Saviour himself." "No
one ever," says Boniface I., "attempted
to lift up his hand against the
apostolic greatness, from whose judgment
there is no appeal whatever."
The Eighth General Council (869)
defined the supremacy of the Roman
see in the strongest terms, and the
formula of Pope Hormisdas was signed
by the Greek bishops and patriarchs.
In this formula it is distinctly
stated that "in the apostolic see the
true faith is ever preserved immaculate,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[637]</a></span>
and that "they who consent
not to this see are separate from the
communion of the Catholic Church."
The formula also quotes the words of
our Lord, "<i>Thou art Peter, and upon
this rock I will build my church</i>."
The Greek schism, however, required
the reassertion of this doctrine, and it
was accordingly defined as of faith
in the Fourth Lateran Council, a.d.
1215; again in the second of Lyons,
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1274, and again in the Council
of Florence, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1439. The language
of this latter synod is,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We define that the apostolic see and the
Roman pontiff hold the primacy in the whole
world, and that the Roman pontiff himself
is the successor of blessed Peter, the prince
of the apostles, the true vicar of Christ, the
head of the whole church, and the father
and teacher of all Christians; and that to him,
in the person of Peter, our Lord Jesus
Christ gave full power to feed, rule, and
govern the whole church, as is contained in
the acts of the &oelig;cumenical councils and the
sacred canons."</p></blockquote>

<p>In this definition the Greeks, who
were represented at this synod, fully
concurred.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
The year following, the
Patriarch Metrophanes, by an evangelical
letter, announced to the whole
oriental world the reunion of the
Greek and Latin churches, mentioning
at the same time the doctrines
defined in the decree of reconciliation.
The singular charges made by
Mr. Ffoulkes against the Council of
Florence and Pope Eugenius merit
perhaps a brief notice. He denies
the regularity of the council, and accuses
the pope of every kind of duplicity
to control and beguile the
Greek bishops. In reply to these accusations
it may be well to state what
we admit and what we deny. We
admit that the act of the twenty-fifth
session of Basle, which named Florence
as the place of assembly, was
not passed by the majority of the
votes, but by the minority. We admit
that the pope chose an Italian
city, and that he guaranteed to the
eastern bishops a safe-conduct home.
We deny that he exceeded the bounds
of his authority or acted with any cunning
or duplicity toward the Greeks,
who were anxious to promote a reunion,
and especially desirous to meet
the Latin bishops at the very place
which the papal legates designated.
The minority of the Council of Basle
comprised the best and most influential
prelates, while the majority was
composed chiefly of simple country
priests, and of servants of the bishops,
who had been admitted into the congregations
with the right of voting.
It is also Catholic doctrine that the
pope, who alone has the power to
call an &oelig;cumenical council, has the
right to transfer it, when called, from
one place to another. The reason
why Florence was chosen is evident
enough to any honest reader of history.
There was no "barter of temporal
and spiritual gains" between the
pope and the emperor. The eastern
bishops signed the decrees with perfect
willingness, and no constraint
was used with them. Even before
the interview between them at the
council many of them had pressed the
emperor to act in this matter of reunion,
and went so far as to declare
that, should he refuse to take part,
they would assume the responsibility
themselves. There is nothing which
Eugenius did which any pontiff
would not have done, who, under
the circumstances which surrounded
him, felt called to seek the peace and
salvation of the eastern churches.
All attempts to injure the credit or
authority of the Council of Florence
prove unavailing to any one who receives
facts as they are, without color
of prejudice.</p>

<p>4. It is, however, time to notice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[638]</a></span>
what Mr. Ffoulkes asserts in regard
to the Crusades. The pontiff who,
according to him, had built up an authority
upon forged decretals, sought
by means of the Crusades to "complete
by force the ecclesiastical aggrandizement
of the papacy." "He
attempted to subjugate the churches
of the east to that of Rome in the
way opposed to the canons, and this
was exactly what he completed on
the capture of Constantinople." The
answer to this charge, as far as the
animus of the pope was concerned,
has already been made. We have
shown how Innocent III. had no need
to build up a power which he already
possessed, and which his predecessors
for centuries had claimed and exercised.
Then it is simply untrue that
the popes had any idea of subjugating
the eastern churches in the encouragement
which they gave to the
Crusades. Let Mr. Ffoulkes refute
himself. In his <i>Christendom's Divisions</i>
he acknowledges that "for
two hundred years the east had been
calling upon the west for assistance,
and that the principal actors in these
wars advocated a great cause, and
one of the holiest struggles ever undertaken
in self-defence." There was
only one reason why the Christian
arms were turned against Constantinople,
and that was the necessity
of protecting the Crusaders against
treachery and destruction by Greek
perfidy. "There was a growing feeling
in Europe," says Mr. Ffoulkes,
"that the Greeks were at the bottom
of all the misfortunes of the Latins
in the east." Of Conrad's army sixty
thousand fell beneath the swords
of the Mussulmans through the treason
of the Greek guides. The emperor
made every effort to ensnare the
formidable army of Louis VII., and
forced the third Crusade, at great loss,
to get to the Holy Land by sea. Barbarossa
could hardly save his soldiers
from the insidious artifices which were
plotted against him. But let the historian
Gibbon, whose judgment is certainly
not partial to the Latins, decide
the matter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It was secretly and perhaps tacitly resolved,"
he says, "by the prince and people
(Greek) to destroy, or at least to discourage
the pilgrims by every species of injury
and oppression, and their want of prudence
and discipline continually afforded the pretence
or the opportunity. The western
monarchs had stipulated a safe passage and
a fair market in the country of their Christian
brethren; the treaty had been ratified
by oath and hostages, and the poorest soldier
of Frederic's army was furnished with
three marks of silver to defray his expenses
on the road. But every engagement was
violated by treachery and injustice, and the
complaints of the Latins are attested by
the honest confession of a Greek historian
who has dared to prefer truth to his country.
Instead of a hospitable reception, the gates
of the cities, both in Europe and Asia, were
closely barred against the Crusaders, and
the scanty pittance of food was let down from
the walls.... In every step of their
march they were stopped or misled; the
governors had private orders to fortify the
passes and break down the bridges against
them; the stragglers were pillaged and murdered;
the soldiers and horses were pierced
in the woods by arrows from an invisible
hand; the sick were burnt in their beds;
and the dead bodies were hung on gibbets
along the highways. These injuries exasperated
the champions of the cross, who
were not endowed with evangelical patience,
and the Byzantine princes, who had provoked
the unequal conflict, promoted the embarkation
and march of these formidable
guests."</p></blockquote>

<p>As far as Innocent III. is concerned,
it is evident from his letters that
he was wholly averse to the capture
of Constantinople, and that he accepted
the establishment of the new
empire only as a means of securing
the soil which had been hallowed by
the footsteps of our Lord. And when
he appointed Thomas Morosini in the
place of John Lamater, who had deserted
his see, he only used his supreme
authority as the head of the
church.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[639]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Innocent," says Mr. Ffoulkes, "was no
lawless invader of the rights of others, but
rather one of the most eminent and exact
canonists that ever adorned the chair of
Peter; and if he took the loftiest views of
the prerogatives of his see, it was because
he believed them to be thoroughly consonant
with law and equity."</p></blockquote>

<p>We think our objector must have
been driven for argument, and somewhat
demented, when he sought the
Crusades for witnesses against the
authority and conceded rights of the
Roman pontiff.</p>

<p>5. Now comes the conclusion,
which is not contained in the premises,
but which, as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex cathedra</i> assertion
of Mr. E. S. Ffoulkes, has all
the value of his personal experience.
He joined the Catholic Church some
years ago, and has not yet formally
renounced it, as far as we know, although
he has incurred an <i>ipso facto</i> excommunication
by obstinately sustaining
heretical propositions and refusing
submission to the judgment of the
holy see. He went often to confession
and communion until he was refused
permission to receive the sacraments.
He does not tell the world
that he purposes to leave us, though he
does say that he ought never to have
abandoned the English Church, whose
memories still expand his heart. He
charges the pope with being an usurper
by many means of fraud, and he
even seems to deny any patriarchal
jurisdiction in England. Being a
judge of the operations of the Holy
Spirit, he finds that converts do not
become any more pious by their submission
to Rome, and to his mind the
Protestant parsonage is "the perfect
ideal of practical Christianity." To
illustrate what a peculiar mind he
has, we will only add, as a piece of
curious information, that he draws
conclusions from what the Council
of Trent did not do. "Luther was
excommunicated, but the Confession
of Augsburg has not been yet anathematized."
"Queen Elizabeth was deposed,
but the council deliberately
abstained from affirming that the bishops
consecrated in her reign were
no bishops." "Even the Thirty-nine
Articles <i>escaped censure</i>." "Anglican
orders, if they have not been recognized
in practice, have never been declared
invalid; still less have the
grounds of their invalidity been set
forth." Our readers who know any
thing of ecclesiastical history may
judge whether Mr. Ffoulkes is sane
or not. What else did the Council
of Trent do but condemn the peculiar
tenets of Augsburg, and the doctrines
contained in the Thirty-nine
Articles? Can any thing be plainer
than this? How have Anglican orders
been passed over in silence, or even
delicately handled? Every child who
reads the Catholic catechism knows
that holy order is a sacrament that
cannot be reiterated without sacrilege.
Yet in every instance where an Anglican
minister has been advanced to
any order of the clergy, ordination has
been given, as to a mere layman,
and that without any condition whatever.
Such has been the invariable
practice of the church, and this upon
the highest authority, so that it has
passed into a universal rule. "Anglican
orders," he says, "have never
been declared invalid; still less have
the grounds of their invalidity been
set forth." We will quote him a decision
of the Holy Office and a decree
of the pope, bearing date April 17th,
1704. As he has found so many
things which are substantially untrue,
why did he not find this decree before
he ventured to publish his letter?
We give as nearly a literal translation
as possible:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the general Congregation of the Holy
Roman and Universal Inquisition, held in the
apostolical palace at St. Peter's, in the presence
of our most holy lord, Clement XI.,
by divine providence pope, and the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[640]</a></span>
eminent and reverend lords, the cardinals
of the holy Roman Church, the aforesaid
memorial having been read, our most holy
lord, the aforesaid pope, having heard the
sentiments of the same eminent personages,
decreed that the petitioner, John Clement
Gordon, be promoted from the commencement
to all, even the holy orders, and the
priesthood; and that, as he has not been fortified
by the sacrament of confirmation, he
be confirmed."</p></blockquote>

<p>Dr. Gordon was the Anglican bishop
of Galloway. He went to Rome,
and was there received into the communion
of the church. The whole
question of his orders was carefully
examined, and the above is the conclusion
of the supreme authority of
the Roman pontiff. "The grounds
of the invalidity of English orders
have never been set forth," says Mr.
Ffoulkes. Let us still further quote
the petition in the case of Dr. Gordon:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It cannot be granted that they (the Anglican
bishops) have received the ministry
from Catholics, since no evidence is produced
of successive ordination. Without this,
there remains no vestige of consecration
with these heretics, besides a ministry derived
from the people or a lay-prince.
Moreover, supposing even that some one of
them had received, by means of legitimate
succession, the episcopal ordination and consecration,
(which, however, is by no means
proved,) still, their orders must now be pronounced
invalid <i>through the defect of matter,
form, and due intention</i>."</p></blockquote>

<p>We presume the argument in this
case will have little weight with our
objector or his friends; but we trust
no one will say again that Rome has
never pronounced a judgment on the
question of Anglican orders. Still,
after the letter we are reviewing, as
well as many things we have seen
and heard in the ritualistic quarter,
we can never be taken by surprise
again. Should they tell us that the
pope is excommunicated by his own
decree, it will not ruffle our peace;
for in the Protestant religion each
man is an infallible pontiff, whose decisions
go beyond the domain of faith,
and rule in the field of history and
science. "If facts are not to our
liking in the past, let us rewrite them,
and make a history to suit ourselves,"
is the language of their acts.</p>

<p>We are not disposed to battle with
the personalities of Mr. Ffoulkes.
Perhaps he has an improper standard
by which to determine the degrees
of sanctity; and this is likely to be
the case if the "English parsonage
with its surroundings" is the norm
of perfection. Where men are as
mere men, we put one against another,
and set forth the hundreds of converts
in our own day with their experience
against Mr. E. S. Ffoulkes
and one or two others. Hundreds
can testify that they have seen more
of real piety and true devotion in the
Catholic Church than they had ever
dreamed possible before they knew
the only mother of saints. Words
are of little value, and assertions can
be bandied about from one mouth to
another. Deeds are the test&mdash;deeds
of self-denial, patience, and unselfish
charity.</p>

<p>As for the sincerity of those who
are seeking the truth, and are in fervor
at the first sight of the Catholic
faith, we have only to say that so long
as they are obedient to the heavenly
voice which calls every honest heart
to the one home of holiness, it is well
with their souls. When the crisis
comes, and the hour when action must
decide the forward or backward march
of the intellect, moved and enlightened
by grace, then is God chosen for
ever, or renounced. Then grace may
linger around the heart which it loved,
and only slowly withdraw, leaving
still the attractions of nature, and
the good gifts which are only for
time, and bear no fruit in eternity.
We would not dare to judge where
grace ends and nature begins, for
both orders are singularly blended in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[641]</a></span>
this scene of probation. But one
thing we do know&mdash;God is true, though
every man be a liar. He cannot fail
us; his revelation cannot pass away
into a fable. "The pillar and ground
of the truth" standeth firm. And
notwithstanding Mr. Ffoulkes's convictions,
we are not afraid to trust our
good works to the judgment of mankind.
Tares are mixed with the
wheat; the net of Peter incloses good
and bad fishes, and scandals must be
found even in the house of God; but
nevertheless, in quiet and unostentatious
beauty the true spouse of Christ is
ever bringing forth fruits which, though
unappreciated on earth, shall bloom
beyond the skies in the sunlight of
God's presence. Sacrifice is a law of
Catholic piety which takes its type
from Calvary and its inspiration from
the Sacred Heart. We live in a different
atmosphere from our Protestant
brethren, and self-denial is second
nature to us; self-denial practised so
spontaneously that the effort and the
trial are hidden in the graciousness
of the Christian life. No sect, and
no individuals, with some rare exceptions,
have caught the spirit of our
religion, which makes heroic virtue
easy, and hides real sanctity in many
hearts that beat only for God. If
Mr. Ffoulkes did not find that perfect
rest for his intellect and his heart
which he expected in the Catholic
Church, the reason of this is, that he
never submitted himself unreservedly
to her supreme and infallible authority
and guidance. Humility and obedience
are the touchstone of true Catholic
virtue, and in both these qualities
his writings and conduct show
him to be singularly wanting. We
wish for him a better mind, and the
grace of a genuine conversion, and
we trust that he may yet repair the
grievous wrong he has done to religion
by his unfilial and rebellious conduct
toward our holy mother the Catholic
Church.</p>

<h2>THE HISTORY OF THE IRISH LAND TENURE.</h2>


<p>Those who are not well acquainted
with the condition of things in Ireland
might easily suppose that the existence
of the odious Established Church was
the main cause of the dissatisfaction of
the Irish people, and that they would,
consequently, be satisfied with its disestablishment.
This, however, is an
error. The main grievance of the
Irish people remains unredressed.
There is still in the relation of landlord
and tenant in that country a
very prolific source of future difficulty.
So far only as the payment
of tithes subtracted from the scant
earnings of the peasantry, the church
establishment could be called an infringement
on the rights of property;
but its existence was looked upon
rather as an encroachment upon abstract
justice than as a source of
material oppression. The evils of
the land tenure, however, which had
their origin many centuries ago, and
which time has somewhat modified,
but not obliterated, are of a far more
serious and practical nature. The
landlord, by every test which can
be applied, has a legal right to his estates;
yet the situation weighs heavily
upon the tenant, and prostrates
the country. Laws which should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[642]</a></span>
compel a proprietor to dispose of his
property would be regarded as tending
to agrarianism, and as an infringement
upon private rights; but no
country can be prosperous, or its people
happy, while the great body of
the population is dependent upon the
power and caprice of a few landed
monopolists. As the record of the
past in this connection is an interesting
one&mdash;a long story, dating still further
back than the reign of Henry
II., and the latter part of the twelfth
century&mdash;we will review it briefly for
the benefit of those who have never
studied carefully or have forgotten
the great wrong which for centuries
has oppressed the Irish race.</p>

<p>In ancient times, in addition to the
four grand divisions of Leinster, Munster,
Ulster, and Connaught, there
was another, the property of the paramount
sovereign. As there does
not appear to have been any rule of
precedence, however, among the four
kings, except that of their ability to
repress their rivals by force of arms,
the territory must have been very frequently
in debate. These several
kingdoms were subdivided into a
large number of principalities, each
inhabited by a distinct sept, and governed
by its own chieftain, called a
carfinny, or toparch. These petty
chiefs were in their own dominions
independent; they created laws, administered
justice, made war or peace,
and so long as they did not encroach
upon the privileges of their superior
sovereign, were unmolested and unquestioned.
They were elective too;
and in this respect the primitive institutions
of Ireland were founded
upon that execrable system which
has distracted and destroyed every
kingdom in which it has been attempted.
The choice of toparchs was
limited, however, by the laws of tanistry
to noble families; and the tanist
was always selected upon the accession
and during the lifetime of the
ruling toparch. Under such a system
intrigue and conflict between the
septs, and between individuals of the
same sept, must have been perpetual;
and it is easy to see that the conditions
were prepared which would
make eventual subjugation by foreign
arms an easy task.</p>

<p>But we now come to a still more
obnoxious feature of the institutions
of Ireland under the Milesian rule;
and it will be no relief to the miseries
entailed upon this unfortunate island,
that the same peculiarity, modified
in other countries, existed very
generally during the feudal ages. The
property in each district was regarded
as the common possession of the
entire sept, but the distribution of the
shares was intrusted to the toparch.
The people themselves had absolutely
no property in the soil; that right
belonged exclusively to the chief, and
tenants were removed whenever it
suited his convenience or caprice.
There were many causes that could
lead to change. The death of the
old toparch and the accession of a
new one, the addition of new members
to the sept, or the death of those
already in the occupancy of a piece
of soil, were some of the many causes
that made the land tenure very
precarious; and the custom of inheritance
by gavelkind, which differed
from the system of England and
Wales, is thought to have perpetuated
the evil. Females were excluded,
and no distinction was made between
legitimate and illegitimate children.
The common people were divided
into freemen and betages. The former
had the privilege of changing their
sept; but the latter were common property
with the soil, and transferred
with it in every deed or sale. Under
a liberal government, and by the aid
of a good administration, the people
of Ireland might have been, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[643]</a></span>
course of seven hundred years, completely
extricated from this situation;
but, as we shall see in the sequel, it
has been the policy of the Norman
nobility in that country, if not of
the English government itself, to
maintain as far as possible the original
condition of things. Such were
the institutions of Ireland at the beginning
of the ninth century, when
the Danish monarch Turgesius overran
the entire island, and subjugated
the inhabitants to his authority. His
dominion was of short duration, however;
for at the battle of Clontarf,
fought on Good-Friday, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1014,
the celebrated Brien Boiroimhe gave
him a permanent leave of absence
from the five provinces, and a limited
monarchy in the seaports. But the
factions inherent in the Irish system
of government at that time placed
the national independence at the
mercy of a foreign aggressor, and the
ambition of the Norman element in
England soon marked the island as
a prize worthy an adventure at arms.</p>

<p>The immediate cause of the invasion
was the act of young Dermod
McMurchaid, King of Leinster, who
ran off with the beautiful Devorghal,
wife of O'Rourke, and princess of
Breffny. Having, by reason of this
outrage, been driven from his kingdom,
he invited Richard Strongbow,
Earl of Pembroke, and Robert Fitzstephen,
to his assistance. Thus the
dissensions among the Irish princes
opened the way for the adventure
of the Norman noblemen. A few
hundred Norman cavaliers, followed
by comparatively a handful of infantry,
were sufficient to secure a permanent
footing, an event most singular
when we take into consideration
the military record which those
people have made since that period.
But the Irish have always shown a
capacity to fight better in any other
cause than their own. True, the Norman
adventurers from England did
not succeed immediately in the subjugation
of the entire island. Their
dominion was limited to a small area;
but they found and used those elements
of discord among the native
rulers which made their situation impregnable
against those who still cherished
the idea of freedom and independence.
The Irish were worsted
in every considerable conflict; not so
much, perhaps, through the superiority
of their adversaries as by reason of
their own disunion.</p>

<p>The new rulers endeavored only to
consolidate their power, and made no
effort for the reformation of existing
institutions. If they found a large proportion
of the inhabitants in a condition
akin to serfdom, there was certainly
no motive why they should
desire to change the situation. It
only gave them more personal consideration
and power. Hence, we find
that Strongbow and his associates had
hardly established themselves in their
new dominions before they strove to
perpetuate the old customs of tenure
and descent. The distinction between
the new settlers and the natives was
carefully preserved; and the benefit
of English laws permitted only to Normans,
to the citizens of seaport towns,&mdash;who
were still, it is to be presumed,
in great part Danes&mdash;and to a few
who had received charters of denization
as a matter of personal favor.
Five septs only, say the historians,
were received within the English
pale, and the rest were all accounted
aliens or enemies, who, even down to
the reign of Elizabeth, had no rights
which an Englishman was bound to
respect.</p>

<p>The Great Charter, wrested from
King John, and confirmed by Henry
III., did not benefit Ireland. English
laws and jurisprudence were extended
over those portions of the island
known as the English pale, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[644]</a></span>
during the reign of King John the
lands subject to the crown were divided
into counties, sheriffs appointed,
and supreme courts of law established
in Dublin. But these improvements
were made rather as a convenience
for the English than for the protection
of the native inhabitants. During
the reign of Edward I., we read
that Lord De Clare, connected by
marriage with the Geraldines, then
the most powerful Norman house in
Ireland, was granted extensive domains
in Thomond. No regard was
paid to the rights of native possessors
in this transfer, and though a war, in
which the new proprietor was defeated
by O'Brien, an Irish chieftain, was
the result, no considerable advantages
seem to have been derived from the
conflict. At the close of the century,
we are told that all hopes of independence
were resigned, and eight
thousand marks offered to the king
for the rights of British subjects. No
doubt the cupidity of the monarch
would have been gratified by so profitable
a disposal of privileges, but
the favor was not granted by reason
of the opposition of the local aristocracy.
At the first constitutional parliament,
summoned in 1295 by Sir
John Wogan, several judicious acts
are said to have been passed; but we
are unable to see in what manner they
operated in favor of the native inhabitants.
After the war caused by the
invasion of Ireland by Edward Bruce,
in the year 1315, the exaction of
"coyne and livery" by the impoverished
barons first appears, and the
method of supporting an army by
quartering it on the people was instituted.
During a period of active
hostilities, and upon the territory of
an enemy, such an expedient may be
pardonable; but in a country regulated
by what was nominally a domestic
government it would be hard to perpetrate
an act of grosser tyranny.</p>

<p>To afford an idea of the situation
of the native inhabitants at this period,
we will instance the statute of
Kilkenny, passed in the year 1367,
by a parliament summoned by the
Duke of Clarence. This precious bit
of legal wisdom provides that marriage,
fosterage, or gossipred with the
Irish, or submission to the Irish law,
should be regarded as high treason,
and punished accordingly. This fosterage
or gossipred, of which the English
legislators were so fearful, was the
practice, traditional among the Irish,
of allowing the children of the nobility
to be nursed by the wives of the
peasantry; and the custom was
thought to encourage a sentiment of
reciprocal kindness between the lower
and the higher orders of the population.
The statute also declared
that if any man of English descent
should adopt an Irish name, be guilty
of speaking the Irish language, or
follow any of the customs of the country,
he should forfeit his estate, or
give security for better conduct. It
made penal the act of presenting an
Irishman to any benefice, or his reception
into any monastery. It also
forbade the entertainment of any native
bard, minstrel, or story-teller; <i>or
the granting of permission for an Irish
horse to graze in the pasture of a loyal
English subject</i>. To such a degree
had risen the follies of the dominant
race in Ireland in the last half of the
fourteenth century.</p>

<p>During the reign of Henry VII.
we begin to witness that struggle between
the Anglo-Irish nobility and
the crown which, in the end, without
improving the condition of the
masses, was the means of breaking
down many noble houses, and still
further adding to the distresses of the
country. In the parliament of 1494,
the act known as Poyning's law was
passed. Its enactment was secured
by Sir Edward Poyning, lord-deputy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[645]</a></span>
of the island, and its purpose was to
prevent the assembling of an Irish
parliament without the consent of the
king. It is easy to see in such an
act, however wise it might have been
considered, the dawn of fresh conflicts
of authority.</p>

<p>During the life of Queen Mary, we
have an instance of what fearful infamy
could be perpetrated under the
system of the Irish land tenure. The
septs of O'More and O'Carroll, two
chiefs who, under a previous reign,
had been arrested, thrown into prison,
and left there to perish, claimed that
their lands could not be justly forfeited
through the offence of their toparchs;
but that the ground was the property
of the clans, and inalienable save
through their own acts. An army
was the only response to this reasonable
claim, and the inhabitants were
forcibly ejected. But not this only.
The butcheries that signalized the act
were such as to make the event infamous
in history; and, in the language
of a native historian, "the fires
of the burning huts were slaked in the
blood of the inhabitants." O'Fally
and Leix, the territory occupied by
the unfortunate septs, were converted
into King's and Queen's counties, and
the principal towns were called Philipstown
and Maryborough, in commemoration
of the queen and her
husband. This transaction was one
of the first fruits of the coming supremacy
of the crown over the local
aristocracy.</p>

<p>We now come to the reign of Elizabeth,
a woman celebrated alike for
her capacity and her vices; and such
was her force of character, and the
consummate ability of her rule, that she
has impressed her policy upon the
history of Ireland more deeply than
any other sovereign. We have not
the space to attempt to follow the incidents
of this turbulent period; but
must be satisfied with a short statement
of the policy of Elizabeth as it
seems to have been developed in her
measures. When the queen was cautioned
against the turbulent and designing
character of O'Neill, an Irish
chief, and Earl of Tyrone, she is
said to have replied that she did not
care for his rebellion, as it would give
her possession of more lands with
which to reward her faithful servants.
Historians have endeavored to explain
away the meaning of this expression,
by attributing it to a desire to silence
the enemies of the Irish nobleman;
but since, from the beginning to the
end of her reign, the history of Ireland
proves that she acted as though determined
to better the instruction,
we have to conclude that in a spirit
of levity she had inadvertently unmasked
her deliberate policy. From
first to last it is only a story of rebellions
provoked for the purpose of destroying
some Irish nobleman, that
an English sycophant might be put
in possession of his estates.</p>

<p>The reign of James I., which began
in 1603, is regarded by English
historians as favorable to Ireland;
but how, it is difficult to understand.
In some respects the regulations of
this king were perhaps advantageous.
The introduction of English law over
the entire island, the abolition of tanistry
and gavelkind, and the more
general institution of courts of justice,
had public sentiment been healthy,
might have eventuated in great advantages;
but the spirit of religious persecution,
which was now becoming
implacable, served to keep alive the
animosity of the races, and all improvement
was more theoretic than
real. Previous to this time, patents
for English tenure had been granted
only to great lords and chieftains;
while their vassals, still retaining their
own laws and customs, owed no direct
allegiance to the crown. Under
the new regulation, estates were to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[646]</a></span>
descend by the course of common
law, and the people were placed within
its operation; but they had really
no more interest in the soil than formerly.
The king was merely substituted
for the toparchs, and while the
chiefs were humiliated, their subjects
were not made more independent.
The land held in demesne by the
chieftain was all that was left under
his absolute control, but his tenants
were subject to an annual rent.</p>

<p>Another project, which originated
in the fertile brain of Queen Elizabeth,
we believe, but which was not
successfully executed until the reign
of James I., deserves especial notice.
This was a plan for driving out the
native settlers, that their places might
be filled by adventurers from England.
Six counties out of the thirty-two into
which Ireland was then divided were
appropriated for carrying out the experiment,
and cut up into portions of
one thousand, fifteen hundred, and
two thousand acres each. The largest
of these estates were for undertakers
and servitors of the crown,
consisting of great officers of state,
and rich adventurers from England;
those of the second-class were for servants
of the crown in Ireland, and
might be peopled by either English
or Irish tenants; and those of the
third were for natives of the province,
when it suited the undertakers to
permit them to cultivate the soil. This
scheme of cruelty was followed by
another, of a still more atrocious character&mdash;the
search after defective titles.
In the long period of civil
commotions which preceded the reign
of James I., it is to be presumed that
many were occupying lands for which
they could not show a very clear claim.
If the crown could get possession of
property through the simple loss of
the proof on the part of the occupant
that he was entitled to his inheritance,
a source of great public profit
would be opened out. Eighty-two
thousand five hundred acres were by
this means apportioned to English
settlers, and the national exchequer
was correspondingly enriched. Yet in
spite of such transactions as these,
the reign of King James has been
pronounced a happy one for Ireland!</p>

<p>At the time of the accession of
Charles I., Ireland was treated simply
as a conquered province, not as
an integral portion of the British empire,
and its inhabitants still looked
upon as aliens and enemies. They
had no rights which the officers sent
by royal authority, and controlled by
cupidity, were obliged to respect, and
the very desire for the possession of
a piece of land inherited by a proprietor
of native descent was sufficient
reason for an act of attainder for treason
or a search after defective titles.
To such an extent was this latter species
of iniquity carried that, during the first
years of the reign of Charles I., and
under the administration of Stafford as
lord-deputy, more than a quarter of
a million of acres were wrested from
the real proprietors, and transferred
to the hands of English adventurers.
Even jurors who sat upon the causes
in dispute were imprisoned, and excessive
fines imposed, if they refused
compliance with the wishes of the
king's lieutenant.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, it was
only natural that the Irish should
look about for some means of redress.
Property was becoming daily less secure;
for the successful practice of
this species of plunder was a continual
encouragement to fresh outrage;
and there was no estimate of
the degree to which the injury might
be carried. But the remedies proposed
in the beginning were peaceful.
The lords and gentry met together
and drew up a bill of rights, and offered
to pay a large sum of money
for the royal assent. This measure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[647]</a></span>
known as the Charter of Graces, by
one of its provisions proposed to
limit the title of the king in lands to
sixty years. Changes also were asked
in the penal code, and a clause was
inserted forbidding the lord-deputy,
during his term of office, from coming
in possession of land either by
purchase or confiscation. The demands
were in every respect temperate,
and nothing more was asked
than a reasonable security for private
property, and such privileges as the
dignity and self-respect of the subject
would require. The king, when the
charter was first presented for his
signature, was inclined to look upon
its provisions with favor; but through
the influence, it is said, of Lord Strafford,
he was induced to withhold his
approval. But while this subject was
agitating with alternate hopes and
fears the minds of the Irish people,
a new measure, or rather an extension
of the old system, was planned by
the lord-deputy. The success of the
English colonization scheme, undertaken
in Ulster during the reign of
James I., had opened the way for
still another attempt at dispossessing
the native population of their lands;
and Connaught was selected as the
next field for operations. This second
experiment would probably have
proved as successful as the first, if the
inevitable fruit of so much tyranny
had not come to its maturity.</p>

<p>The uprising of the Irish population
in 1641 occurred under more
favorable auspices than any previous
one, and had they made a united
effort for absolute independence, England
could not have resisted the
forces which were brought into the
field against her. But the confederates,
as the Irish party was called,
were composed of elements too much
at variance among themselves to meet
with permanent success. The Anglo-Irish
inhabitants, or those of English
descent, who were looking simply to
the security of their property, and
exemption from the tyranny of local
officers, had no bond of union with the
native Irish, who sought the complete
recovery of their lost liberties and
the rehabilitation of their ancient institutions.
Here was a cause for faction
which their enemies readily understood,
and by which they as readily
profited. The Anglo-Irish were
afraid of the resumption of power by
the descendants of the native chieftains,
and it was natural that they
should seek to avoid such a result.
Nevertheless, led by officers whose
exile from their country in former
years had been the means of raising
them to eminence in the armies of
France, Spain, and Germany, the
confederates were very successful,
and obtained possession of almost
the entire island. The peasantry
came down from the mountains,
whither they had been driven years
before to give place to the English
colonists, and, without bloodshed,
again took peaceable possession
of their lost domains. Owen
O'Niel, an officer who had done eminent
service on the continent, was the
ruling spirit of the movement, and it
was through his management and address
that the confederacy was enabled
to maintain such formidable proportions.
But the various incidents
of that struggle, prolonged through
several years, and ending finally during
the dictatorship of Cromwell, belong
rather to history than to such
an article as this, and we must restrict
our attention to the results that
followed upon the triumph of the
English arms.</p>

<p>The troops that Cromwell had
brought into Ireland were the most
puritanical of his entire army. He
had probably at this period begun
to indulge in regal aspirations; and
hence he desired the removal from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[648]</a></span>
England of the more ultra republican
and radical of his followers.
It is likewise probable that he selected
this class of men because their
religious fanaticism would make them
more zealous in the cause. In the
final settlement of the country, as
Ulster and Connaught were already
the property of the colonists, and not
subject to confiscation, the two remaining
provinces of Munster and
Leinster had to satisfy the claims of
the army, and were accordingly portioned
out to the followers of Cromwell.
The property of the lords and
gentry who had joined the confederation
was ruthlessly confiscated. The
peasantry who had survived the long
war were reduced to a state akin to
slavery, and many indeed, by order
of Cromwell, were sold in the Barbadoes,
and in other dependencies of
Great Britain. About 200,000 people
in all, it is estimated, left the island,
of whom 40,000 entered the
various armies of continental Europe.
These comprised all classes; as to
the peasantry who remained, some estimate
may be formed of their privileges
when we state that they were
forbidden to leave their parishes, or
to assemble together for public worship,
or for any other purpose whatever.
The Cromwellian soldiers of
every grade, from privates to commanding
officers, had taken possession
of the estates; and these were
the new lords to whom allegiance
was due, and by whom it was most
rigidly exacted.</p>

<p>But the commonwealth was already
crumbling to pieces. The death
of Cromwell, and the dissatisfaction
caused by a government which was
aristocratic and despotic without being
regal, soon paved the way for the
accession of Charles II., and revived
the hopes of those who had been unjustly
deprived of their estates at the
close of the war. From first to last
the Anglo-Irish portion of the confederates
claimed that they had been
contending for Charles I., and only
against his enemies and the parliament.
Of the fact that they had
desired simply protection, and had
been more loyal than disloyal to the
throne, there was abundant evidence;
and it was to be presumed that the
new king would look with more favor
upon their claims than upon those
of their opponents. To the end of
recovering their property, therefore,
they began to petition the king in
great numbers. That there might
be a semblance of justice, a court of
claims was established for the ostensible
purpose of adjudication. But
it was soon evident that there was
no intention of dispossessing the new
proprietors; and when it was found
that, without the most gross and palpable
violations of right, it would be impossible
frequently not to decide in favor
of the former occupants of the confiscated
estates, the court was adjourned,
and was never allowed to hold another
session. Many thousands, by
this act, were irretrievably ruined. The
Duke of Ormond, prominent throughout
the rebellion, played an important
part, to the disadvantage of his countrymen,
in these transactions, and
added enormously to his own estates.
At the beginning of the rebellion his
property had been about nine tenths
encumbered; but by securing an act
transferring all encumbrances to the
king, and then obtaining a release from
his obligations in that quarter, he
freed himself from all his difficulties.</p>

<p>When James II. ascended the English
throne, about two thirds of the
private property of Ireland appears
to have been in dispute. The dispossessed
proprietors were still clamoring
for their rights, and the
Cromwellian settlers and the colonists
were as sturdily adhering to their
claims, and ready at any time to defend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">[649]</a></span>
their new possessions by either
legitimate or illegitimate means. The
reign of James from the beginning
was weak. The trifling rebellions
in Scotland and England which disturbed
the first years of his authority
were easily quelled, it is true; but
he seems to have been intoxicated by
his success, and led to the support of
measures which were not advised by
either prudence or good judgment.
The spirit of religious intolerance
was at this time most active and implacable.
It had been many years
since the separation of the English
Church from the Catholic authority,
and the time might have been thought
propitious for something like a recognition
of equality between religious
bodies; but James endeavored to
promote the interest of Catholicity
with a zeal that was not to be tolerated
by the Protestant bigotry of
the day, and many of his acts gave
great offence. Of this character
was the appointment of the Earl
of Tyrconnel, a Roman Catholic,
first to the command of the Irish
army, and afterward to the government
of Ireland itself. The Protestant
inhabitants of that country,
who knew by what a doubtful claim
they held their estates, could not fail
of taking the alarm and looking forward
to the day when there would be
an attempt made to dispossess them
of the disputed property. The event
proved, indeed, that their fears were
not groundless. The act of settlement,
the measure upon which the
Protestant proprietors depended for
the possession of their lands, became
immediately the subject in debate;
and it was soon evident that its repeal
was intended. To comprehend
fully the magnitude of such an undertaking,
it will be necessary to glance
at the situation of the island at this
period, and see to what an extent
the inhabitants of the country had
been plundered of their property.
The whole number of acres of land in
Ireland was estimated at above 10,400,000,
and of this amount 3,000,000
acres were unproductive. This would
leave about 7,000,000 acres of arable
and pasture land, and 5,000,000 of
these, during the reign of Charles I.,
were still in the hands of Catholic
proprietors. Then followed the revolution
with the irruption of Cromwell's
followers. The situation became
greatly changed. At the time of
the passage of the act of settlement,
only about 800,000 acres remained
in the hands of Catholic proprietors.
Of the remainder, 800,000 acres were
under the control of the government,
but leased to Protestants, and 3,300,000
had gone to reward the prowess
of the Protector's soldiers. This property
had now been in the hands of its
present occupants, or absentee landlords,
for nearly forty years. To repeal
the act which settled all this
broad inheritance upon the adventurers
was undoubtedly the intention
of James; and although this was not
the only charge which the British aristocracy
and people made against their
unpopular sovereign, it was a powerful
influence in the train of events
that seated the Prince of Orange on
the English throne.</p>

<p>Exiled from London, the unfortunate
James fled to Dublin. The Irish
parliament of 1689, which was summoned
by his authority, besides repudiating
the jurisdiction of the English
courts of law and of the English
parliament, and proclaiming the
independence of the Irish legislature,
repealed the act of settlement;
but, as the event proved, these acts
were the mere mockery of regal and
legislative enactments, and were not
productive of even a temporary advantage
to his adherents. The Prince
of Orange, now recognized as King
William of England, came in person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[650]</a></span>
to Ireland, and the two kings
confronted each other at the battle
of the Boyne. History has told the
story of the discomfiture and inglorious
flight of James, and of the prolonged
and desperate struggle which
the Irish afterward maintained against
their adversaries; until finally the treaty
of Limerick confirmed and strengthened
the English in their possessions.
Some concessions were made to the
Irish, it is true, but they were of a
character that affected religion more
than the tenure of property; and at
the final settlement, we are told, only
233,106 acres of land remained in
the hands of Catholic proprietors.</p>

<p>This was the last great event that
influenced to a considerable degree
the tenure of property in Ireland.
After a struggle of about five hundred
years, we find the island completely
at the feet of the conquerors, and the
descendants of the native inhabitants
with no inheritance, or next to none,
upon their own territory. We might
have heightened the picture by recounting
the assassinations and butcheries
of the various wars, the outrages
of military government, and the refined
cruelties of religious persecution;
but these things did not enter
into the purpose of this article, and
we have confined ourselves to simple
statements of facts in their relation
to the tenure of property. We have
endeavored to trace the means by
which the great bulk of the real estate
on the island has been transferred
from those whose descent entitled
them to a proprietary interest in the
soil to a class of foreign and frequently
absentee landlords, who manifest
no interest in the country or the people
save by the annual collection of
their tenant dues. It cannot have
failed to impress the reader that the
purpose of the English government,
from the beginning, has been to crush
out and destroy as far as practicable
the native inhabitants, and to supply
their place with a foreign population.
To this end only could have been
designed the various colonization
schemes that distinguished the reigns
of James I. and Charles II.; the different
edicts of expulsion, and the
readiness with which the English government
has always advanced the
wishes of those who contemplated a
voluntary expatriation from their native
country. But in despite of all
this, the proportional native population
of the island has steadily increased,
while in both Great Britain and
America the Irish people have become
a formidable power. Their
complaints and demands for redress
of grievances can no longer be passed
by in silent contempt. The land
question must be settled upon some
basis that will not merely place the
Irish peasantry upon the footing of
an independent tenantry, but will enable
every laborer to look forward to
the eventual possession of a portion
of the soil, that thus a fitting stimulus
and reward may be offered to thrift
and industry.</p>

<h2>AT THE CHURCH DOOR.</h2>


<p>A lovely afternoon in September
was drawing to its close; the shadows
were long upon the pavement,
and a gentle breeze brought the fragrance
of heliotrope and late roses
over the wall from a garden adjoining
a handsome house in the old and
well-known town of N&mdash;&mdash;. The
hall-door opened and shut behind a
young woman who walked rather
wearily down the steps and along the
street. It was evident that she was
not thinking of the sun, nor the breeze,
nor the sweet breath of the flowers;
she looked neither to the right nor to
the left, and yet her steps seemed
listless and without an aim.</p>

<p>Her dress was plain, plain almost
to poverty, and without the slightest
attempt at ornament, yet it would
have been impossible to pass her
without notice. She was tall and
graceful, and her features were very
handsome; but that was not what
would have attracted your attention;
there was a something which told she
was a lady&mdash;not perhaps in the truest
meaning of the word, as it may be
applied to a servant-girl or an apple-woman
whose instincts are refined
and Christian; but you felt that she
was well-born and well-bred, and
that her tastes were such as would
not well accord with her coarse dress
and shabby bonnet. True, if you
had been a close observer, you might
have seen that her boots were very
pretty, her gloves of the best kid, very
fresh and unworn at the finger-tips,
and it might have surprised you to
see that on her ungloved hand sparkled
a splendid ruby. But enough
for exterior description; the face,
though so fair, was clouded and preoccupied,
and as she walked she
drew a letter from her pocket and
glanced at its contents.</p>

<p>"He appoints seven o'clock to
meet me," she said to herself, "on
the stone seat outside the Catholic
church. A strange place to choose!
I wish it had been somewhere else!
Yet why should I care? What is
that church to me more than another?
And soon I shall give my promise that
it shall be less than every other. It
is a kind offer, a generous offer; but
I will not exchange you"&mdash;here she
gave a contemptuous twitch to her
dress&mdash;"for a better till my wedding
day. He and every one shall see
that I consider myself his equal, even
in these shabby clothes. O dear
me! how tired I am! How that
wretched child insisted on playing
discords with the pedal! I will not
go home, it is so far; but rest somewhere,
and think how I can accept
him most graciously. I might as
well sit on the stone seat here outside
the church; the shade of that tree
looks inviting."</p>

<p>Agnes&mdash;for that was the name of
the girl whose reverie we have put
into words for the benefit of our readers&mdash;had
come to the pretty church
where Mr. Redfern had appointed to
meet her. She sat down on the
bench outside, and we will take this
opportunity to tell who she was and
why she waited there.</p>

<p>Agnes Deblois was the only child
of Catholic parents; they were wealthy,
and as she was their idol, she was
surrounded with friends, comforts, and
pleasures; with every thing, in short,
that makes life bright and beautiful.
She had been carefully instructed and
trained in her religion by her excellent
and fond mother; and it was a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">[652]</a></span>
misfortune to her when this pious lady
died, leaving her daughter, at the age
of seventeen, to the care of a father
who was a negligent and unpractical
Catholic. Agnes was devoted to her
father, and, influenced by his example
and by the ridicule of her worldly
friends, she allowed herself gradually
to abandon her habits of piety and the
duties of her religion. After three
years, during which Agnes had been
engrossed by the engagements and
excitements of life "in society," her
father also died; when it was discovered
not only that he had lived beyond
his means, but that he was even
largely in debt. By selling house,
silver, and estate, Agnes was enabled
to satisfy all the creditors, and, finding
herself almost without a dollar,
she looked around for her friends,
whose protestations of devotion she
recalled, and to whose sympathy she
naturally turned. But she was shocked
at the change she found even in
those of whose fidelity she had felt sure.</p>

<p>She was offered assistance, it was
true, and even a home, yet with a
coldness and constraint which showed
she was considered in the light of
a burden. From being almost crushed
by the grief of her bereavement,
her spirit rose as the bitterness of her
situation became apparent, and she
very soon resolved to be indebted to
no one either for home or for bread.
Her education had been thorough
and superior; for music she had a
rare talent, and she found it easy to
obtain as many pupils as her strength
would allow her to attend to. She
threw herself into her new duties with
an ardor which arose from wounded
pride, but which was destined to grow
cool as the irksomeness of the daily
routine and unloveliness of the continual
presence of poverty wore upon
her. It was hateful to her to be
poor; to wear clothes which, however
neat and even pretty she might
make them, must still be plain and
cheap. So she gave up all attempt
at ornament, and took a bitter pleasure
in wearing what was coarsest and
most unattractive for her dress, though
allowing herself, as she was able, what
was best in such small articles as
gloves, and still wearing the handsome
jewels she had preserved from her former
life. For this she was greatly
blamed, and even reproved by those
who called themselves her friends, and
who were scandalized at the bad taste
of wearing dresses which a beggar
might despise with ornaments which,
it must be confessed, were handsomer
than their own; but Agnes paid no
attention, and went on her own difficult
and joyless path.</p>

<p>Formerly she had neglected her
religion from carelessness and human
respect; now she kept away from
church because she was always tired
and always sad, and because she no
longer cared for the faith of her mother
and of her own happy childhood.
But now a wonderful thing had happened
to her. She had come to this
beautiful and fashionable place in the
summer because her pupils were there,
and because, as she took pleasure in
saying, she wanted their money, and
at the house of the richest and proudest
of them all she had seen Mr. Redfern,
a man of immense wealth, who
had noticed her, found opportunities of
paying her attentions, and now had
asked her to marry him. She had his
letter in her pocket, and she took it
out once more as she sat outside the
church, and read a passage from it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The only thing I ask of you is this: that
you will give up, now and for ever, all interest
in the Romish Church."</p></blockquote>

<p>"A needless request," she said, and
laughed as she said it, while her heart
gave a leap as she thought of herself
at the head of Mr. Redfern's handsome
house, sitting in state behind his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">[653]</a></span>
high-stepping grays, or receiving the
keys from the hands of the obsequious
housekeeper.</p>

<p>A very old woman passed her and
entered the church, bowing herself
low as she crossed the sacred threshold.
Agnes watched her.</p>

<p>"I wonder if it is a pretty church
inside? I think I have heard that it
is pretty."</p>

<p>Feeling impatient at the slowly
passing time, she rose and walked
through the door, and up the middle
aisle. There were no doors to the
pews, and seeing one that was cushioned,
she entered it, sat down, and
leaning back, looked carelessly round
her.</p>

<p>It was indeed a pretty church; the
softened sunbeams streamed through
the stained glass of the Gothic windows,
and fell in purple and gold
lights on the stone floor, flickering as
the old elms outside moved gently to
and fro in the west wind. She saw
the old woman she had before noticed,
kneeling before a picture, then
leaving it with many bows and courtesies,
and going to another. What
was she about? Oh! she was saying
the stations. Agnes remembered
the stations&mdash;those fourteen grievous
steps in the Passion of our Lord from
his trial in Pilate's house to his burial
in the sepulchre, at the close of his
three hours' agony on the cross.</p>

<p>"Poor old thing! how her back
must ache. Why does she do it?
Why, she is crying, wiping her eyes
with her apron, and lifting her hands
to heaven! Is that for her own sorrows,
or those of her Saviour?"</p>

<p>Agnes was interested; she sat up
and looked about her.</p>

<p>"There are two little children coming
up the aisle. Do see them bob
up and down and cross themselves!
Oh! now they are saying their prayers."</p>

<p>Why should Agnes see them indistinctly?
Why impatiently brush
something from her eyes? Ah! the
picture of her childish days rose before
her, and she was for a moment
once more a little child....</p>

<p>What nonsense! She had other
things to think of now. She would
have a purple satin dress just the color
of that pretty light on the floor.
It was fading away; it must be near
sunset. At that moment came from
a choir of sweet young voices:</p>

<p>"Kyrie eleison! Christe eleison!"</p>

<p>She turned and saw the children
practising for their Sunday-school
Mass, led by an excellent tenor; and
leaning her head on her hand, she listened;
for so she thought the angelic
choirs must sound.</p>

<p>"Kyrie eleison! Christe eleison!"</p>

<p>She knew what those words meant.
Had she not often sung them herself
in days long past? Those dear old
days!</p>

<p>Disturbed by a slight noise, Agnes
glanced around; she saw an old and
venerable-looking man with gray hair,
whose long black dress fell to his feet,
come up the side aisle and enter a
confessional, round which silently gathered
a few women, kneeling till
their turns should come. A vague
fear took possession of her heart, and
she quickly rose to leave the church;
but something stopped her, and she
stood as if riveted to the earth.</p>

<p>What was it? Only a light, a feeble
flame, which shone in a vase
hanging before the high altar. She
had not noticed it before, the sun had
been so bright; but it was there all
the time, and would be there when
she had turned her back upon it.
Whose presence did the light reveal?
Who was it that waited day and night
upon that holy altar? Alone, unknown,
forgotten&mdash;yes, and betrayed.</p>

<p>She uttered no sound; but her
heart gave a great cry as she fell upon
her knees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[654]</a></span></p>

<p>"Kyrie eleison! Christe eleison!"
Those innocent voices still prolonged
the hymn, though what was their
need of mercy compared with hers?
But the thought came to her that perhaps
those invocations of God's mercy
by the little lambs of his fold
would ascend in his sight not for
them, but for her, for the strayed
sheep; and thinking thus, she felt herself
comforted. Kneeling motionless
with her head bowed on her hands,
she did not pray, nor weep, but only
<em>saw</em>.</p>

<p>She saw herself a little child robed
in white, one of a band of many little
ones, with her shining veil, a true
marriage garment, receiving at the
altar for the first time her God and
Saviour.</p>

<p>She saw herself again, still a child,
but older, kneeling again to receive
the bishop's hand on her forehead,
and hearing the sacred words, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Signo
te signo crucis</i>. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Confirmo te chrismate
salutis.</i><a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>She saw her mother lying pale and
faint, but with eyes full of light and
peace, and heard those dying words,
"My only child, remember that he
who is ashamed of the Son of Man
here, of him will He be ashamed before
His Father in heaven. Remember
that, and remember your best
Friend." Who was that Friend?</p>

<p>She saw herself not once, but many,
many times, blushing at the name of
her faith, hearing it despised and turned
into ridicule; at last denying it and
becoming a scoffer herself. Whom
had she denied and despised?</p>

<p>She thought of the friends who had
deserted her, and the answer came,
"Because I have deserted my best
Friend."</p>

<p>She remembered her weary labors
and thankless efforts, and a voice replied,
"But my yoke is sweet, and
my burden light."</p>

<p>She said to herself, "But there is
one who has offered me enough to
pay for all I have lost;" and once
more the Holy Ghost spoke to her
heart, "Come unto me, you that labor
and are burdened, and I will refresh
you."</p>

<p>That was meant for her; that was
what she wanted for her weary, troubled
soul. "For the life is more than
the meat, and the body more than the
raiment."</p>

<p>The voices of the children were silent
as she once more rose and looked
about her. There was no one
kneeling at the altar now; shadows
had fallen deeply upon the pavement;
she was alone in the church. No!
for yonder at the window stood the
priest, holding his breviary up high to
catch the fading light. What was he
waiting for? Who was it that waited
long, long hours in that holy tribunal
of penance for the straying, lost
sheep to come back to the fold? Her
every question was answered, and,
urged by an impulse she could not resist,
she rose and hurried to the confessional,
thinking as she cast an
imploring glance toward the priest,
"Will he see me? Will he come
and save me?"</p>

<p>She knelt trembling, scarcely daring
to breathe, till she heard his step approaching,
and in a moment the long
unheard, yet strangely familiar words,
"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dominus sit in corde tuo et in labiis
tuis, ut rite confitearis omnia peccata
tua</i>."<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>"Well, my child?"</p>

<p>Well may we let the curtain drop,
not to penetrate that sacred confidence.
O poor soul! thou art safe.
There are hymns of joy and thanksgiving
ascending to the eternal Father;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[655]</a></span>for we know "there is joy before the
angels of God upon one sinner doing
penance."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Half an hour later, as the clock
struck seven, Mr. Redfern stood at
the church door, and asked an old
woman whom, with beads in hand,
he met hobbling out, if she had seen
a young lady waiting there.</p>

<p>"No," she answered readily; "but
there was a beautiful lady inside, on
her knees before the holy Mother of
God. Bless her sweet face!"</p>

<p>With a terrible fear in his heart, he
entered the church, and stood beside
a form bowed before the altar dedicated
to the Immaculate Mother. He
touched her arm, and Agnes raised
her face, suffused with happy tears,
yet smiling. She looked at him bewildered&mdash;for
she had forgotten all
about him&mdash;as he said, in a whisper,</p>

<p>"Have you lost your senses?
Come with me. I want to speak to
you."</p>

<p>She rose obediently and followed
him to the door. The tall tree-tops
waved in the breeze, and the young
moon stood in the sky. She was still
silent, motionless, and he said in a
hoarse voice, that trembled in spite of
his efforts to control it,
"Are you coming with me?"</p>

<p>"No," she answered, "I must go
back; I cannot leave It yet."</p>

<p>"What do you mean? I came
for an answer to my letter. Have
you read it?"</p>

<p>She made a strong effort, and replied,
"Yes, I read it; but I have
found peace and my faith again, and
I forgot that you were coming. O
Mr. Redfern! for years I have been
ashamed of the Son of God; but I
did not remember, till to-day, that he
would be ashamed of me before his
Father. How could I bear that?
But now he has forgiven me, and
made me happy, oh! so happy. I
must go back to him." And she looked
at the door.</p>

<p>Mr. Redfern stood speechless for a
moment. "I could not have a papist
wife," he said slowly. "So this is
my answer, is it?"</p>

<p>But Agnes had already turned
away, and in a moment more was
kneeling again beneath that faithful
light, forgetting all but her love and
gratitude; and as the lamps were
lighted in the choir, the children's
glad and rapturous voices chanted,</p>

<p>"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gloria in excelsis Deo, et in terra
pax hominibus bonæ voluntatis.</i>"</p>

<h2>THE IMMUTABILITY OF THE SPECIES.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></h2>

<p class="center">III.</p>


<p>No alleged factor of evolution is
so capable of arresting the attention
of a physiologist as correlation of
growth. To this law we have before
often incidentally alluded. But as
we conceive that it furnishes strong
confirmation of our views, it behooves
us to extend to it a somewhat more
lengthy treatment.</p>

<p>The current impression is, that
every authenticated instance of variation
is so much added to the probabilities
of the evolution of the species;
and that the refutation of Darwinism
is rendered difficult just in
proportion to the number of proofs
of variability. It is natural, then,
that Darwin should accord prominence
to those factors which play a
part in inducing modification. Conspicuous
among these factors is correlation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">[657]</a></span>
the nearest approximation to
a law of all the colligations of facts
involved in Darwinism.</p>

<p>Correlation is a bond, <i>nexus</i>, or
connection subsisting between different
growths. Owing to it, a modification
seldom arises in any portion
of the organism without involving
a corresponding change in another
part. It is often not a little difficult
to determine which part first varies
and induces the modification of the
other. Frequently, characters simultaneously
vary, and are apparently
affected by some distinct cause. Correlation
is an important subject for
Darwin; for, owing to its operation,
varieties seldom differ from each other
by a single character alone. He declares
that "all the parts of the organism
are, to a certain extent, connected
or correlated together," and
that "of all the laws governing variability,
that of correlation is the most
important." Parts, however, differ
greatly with respect to the strength of
their connection. In some parts, the
tie is ever manifesting itself; in others,
it is seldom traceable. Each character,
when developed, tends to stimulate the
development of others. But, owing
to adversity of conditions, or to being
systematically suppressed by man,
these correlated growths lose all ability
to respond to this stimulus, and,
in consequence, fail to develop.</p>

<p>We intended to adduce quite a
number of facts from Darwin, in order
to enable our readers clearly to
understand the precise nature of correlation.
But want of space forces
us to change our mind. We do this
with less reluctance, when we consider
that those for whom this article is
more especially written have already
familiarized themselves with those
facts.</p>

<p>All the phenomena of correlation
show increase of growth corresponding
to increase, and decrease corresponding
to decrease. Now, the antithesis
to correlation is compensation
or balancement of growth. This alleged
law, as applied to species under
nature, was propounded by Goethe
and Geoffroy St. Hilaire. It implies
that the development of any one part
is attended with the reduction or starvation
of some other part. Not a
little diversity of opinion exists respecting
the validity of this law. Darwin
inclines to believe that compensation
occasionally occurs, but conceives
that its importance has been
overestimated.</p>

<p>We, however, are of opinion that
there is really no such law. That
correlation obtains, there is not the
slightest doubt. The instances of
correlation are innumerable; and
every one of them is a disproof of the
doctrine of compensation of growth.
For the law of correlation is totally
incompatible with the law of economy
of growth. The latter, according to
the hypothesis, makes decrease correspond
to increase, and increase to
decrease. The former entails the reverse.
Both laws, then, cannot stand.
One must, of necessity, fall. One
must negative the other. Unquestionably,
the stronger law is correlation.
This law none can invalidate.
It follows thence that there is no
such law as that of compensation of
growth.</p>

<p>The reader is now naturally desirous
to know how we explain away
the alleged cases of economy of growth.
The explanation is, that they are
merely manifestations of correlation.
The reduction of the given parts is
consequent, not, as alleged, upon the
building up of some other parts, but
upon the suppression or reduction of
correlated parts. Strong confirmation
of this view is given by the fact that
seeming compensation of growth is
more observable under nature than
under domestication. As development<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">[658]</a></span>
under nature is slow and occasional, we
would expect to find, upon the theory
of Goethe and St. Hilaire, very few
instances of apparent balancement of
growth. On the contrary, the instances
are most numerous; which
fact is strictly in accordance with
our hypothesis. For where we find
the conditions entailing the reduction
of many parts, there must we also
find the reduction of other parts, induced
by correlation. These parts,
then, being in close proximity with
characters which neither the conditions
nor correlation have affected,
their suppression is naturally referred
to compensation of growth. Under
domestication, however, development
is carried on rapidly and to a great
extent. A very large number of characters
is selected and developed.
Here, then, we should look for the
most striking manifestations of compensation
of growth. But it is a fact,
of which the significance is at once
apparent, that, instead of meeting
with the fulfilment of our expectations,
the converse thrusts itself most
obtrusively upon our attention. Nature
here is most prodigal; giving
growth for growth, and meeting the
development of one feature with the
corresponding development of another.
The cases illustrating apparent
balancement of growth are here exceptional.
They bear a very insignificant
proportion to those under nature.
Hence we conclude that the
law of compensation of growth never
obtains, that its apparent manifestations
are really due to the operation
of the law of correlation.</p>

<p>But there are two classes of cases
of which correlation is not an interpretation.
The first is the instances
in which the tie of correlation is in a
measure broken by man's selection of
one part, and by his systematic suppression
of another. Darwin refers
to these when he declares it "scarcely
possible in most cases to distinguish
between the supposed effects of such
compensation of growth, and the
effects of long-continued selection,
which may at the same time lead to
the augmentation of one part and the
diminution of another."</p>

<p>The following is an example of the
second class of cases: The Polish
fowl is distinguished by the possession
of a crest of feathers on the head.
In consequence of its development,
there arises a protuberance on the
skull. This is due to correlation.
But in the cock, the skull is so perforated
with small holes that at any
point a pin may be sunk to the brain.
This is adduced as an instance of
compensation of growth. But a rational
explanation may readily be assigned.
Darwin has shown that the
crest of feathers is abnormal in the
male, that it normally belongs to the
female. The feature has been gained
by the male by the somewhat mysterious
law of the transmission of secondary
sexual characters. The economy
of growth may then be considered as
abnormal, and may reasonably be attributed
to the character not completely
harmonizing with its fellows.</p>

<p>The facts of correlation meet with
an exhaustive treatment at the hands
of Darwin. Herbert Spencer, however,
almost totally ignores them.
Although they are seemingly most
striking exemplifications of evolution,
he passes with only an occasional incidental
notice. What we conceive
to be Mr. Spencer's reason for thus
ignoring them, we will venture to
give further on. But, while Darwin
extends to the facts of correlation a
full recognition, he is by no means
over-desirous to ascertain their cause.
Correlation is another of those laws
which it pleases Darwin to consider
as ultimate.</p>

<p>Now, the supposition that the correlated
part has arisen by evolution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">[659]</a></span>
involves the absurd conclusion that a
centre of growth normally preëxists
without a relative arrangement of
parts. And on the evolution hypothesis,
we are forced to believe that
an evolved part is correlated to another
part not yet in existence; that
all the parts of the organism anticipate,
as it were, the birth of the new feature,
and so adjust themselves as to
become immediately susceptible to its
influence; and that, while the previous
coördination of parts is destroyed,
owing to the influence of the new-born
feature ramifying throughout
the whole organization, the organism
is capable of immediately effecting a
re-coördination. To assume for any
organism such powers as these, is virtual
hylozoism. The only escape for
him who admits the evolution of variations,
is to adopt the explanation
furnished by the Duke of Argyll&mdash;that
correlations are the <em>direct</em> manifestations
of design.</p>

<p>This interpretation of the teleologist
precludes all further argument. We,
of course, concur in design. But we
do not deem ourselves therefore bound
to take for granted the validity of
every argument adduced in proof
thereof. We conceive that design
can be proved by incontrovertible
evidence, and that it can be shown to
manifest itself in conformity to laws
not merely empirical.</p>

<p>As for the ultra-evolutionist, if he
were to cease regarding correlation
as an ultimate fact, and if he were to
employ himself in placing an interpretation
upon it, he would perceive
that the tie of correlation is strongly
suggestive of reversion, and that its
phenomena completely negative the
hypothesis of evolution.</p>

<p>On the hypothesis of reversion,
correlation is perfectly explicable.
The supposition of reversion necessarily
involves the conclusion that all
the features of the species coexisted
in each individual, saving, of course,
the characters peculiar to the opposite
sex. The perfect organism, then,
is a balance of all the parts. The
parts are correlated to each other
with respect to centres, and these
centres are correlated to each other
with respect to the axis or the aggregate.
All the parts are mutually dependent.
When a part is reduced, it
tends to involve the reduction of its
corresponding part. The centre of
the parts is then weakened, and this
weakening entails the weakening of
the other centres, to which this center
is correlated. The loss or suppression
of even one part, then, manifestly
disturbs the physiological balance&mdash;destroys
the coördination of
the parts. Under nature, many parts
have been lost or reduced, and these
have entailed the loss or reduction of
others. When, under domestication,
characters develop, owing to selection
and favorable conditions, they concur
with the different centres of growth
to effect a return to the balance, and,
in consequence, the correlated parts
arise and assume their primordial relations
to their correlatives and to the
aggregate. When all the parts are
developed, by correlation and otherwise,
there result an equilibrium and
a consequent perfect coördination.
Correlation is the inseparable concomitant
of coördination. Each implies
the other. And this is the reason,
we apprehend, why correlation
is barely noticed by Mr. Spencer. He
feared, we surmise, that a lengthy
philosophical treatment of the subject
would suggest the conception that
correlated growth necessarily implied
previously imperfect coördination.</p>

<p>In order to facilitate the reader's
conception of our meaning, it may
be well to adduce an analogy. Analogies
between organic and inorganic
nature, the advocates of evolution
ever delight in. And as that of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[660]</a></span>
crystal has found especial favor in
their sight, we will venture to use it.
As we conceive that there are laws
governing the organism, which are <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui
generis</i>, we would request our readers
to regard the analogy only as an illustration
of our views, and not in the
light of an argument.</p>

<p>In crystallization, the initial force
involved in the deposition of the first
molecule determines the form and
shape of the crystal. This molecule
is correlated, as it were, to the aggregate
to be formed. It controls the
whole formative process, with a view
to the shape eventually to be attained.
Otherwise, how are we to account
for the due tempering and
modification of the forces implied in
the deposition of each of the atoms
of the accretion? From the first,
there must of necessity be but one
normal process. But this correlation
between the first molecule and the
aggregate is not the correlation which
we wish particularly to illustrate. The
crystal having been fully formed, a
couple of edges are truncated. The
crystal is then placed in a solution
similar to that in which it was formed.
Now, the absence of these edges
implies an abnormal distribution of
the forces. This is manifest; for correlation,
directly with the corresponding
edges and indirectly with the aggregate,
leads to the reproduction of
the lost parts&mdash;a fact manifestly implying
previously imperfect coördination,
and a present equilibrium of
all the parts, or due coördination.
The parts reproduced assume their
previous relations, and effect a return
to the balance impaired by their truncation.
It is hence clear that correlation
implies coördination, and that
coördination implies correlation. Correlation,
then, is a necessary corollary
from the hypothesis of due coördination,
or proportionate development.
It will be seen that, while it receives
a clear, consistent, and rational interpretation
upon the theory of reversion,
it carries with it implications at
variance with the hypothesis of evolution.</p>

<p>As our knowledge of crystallography
is that of an amateur, these views
respecting crystallization may be open
to modification; though we are assured
that they are not so in essentials.</p>

<p>The analogy of the crystal most
happily illustrates our views of correlation.
With equal felicity it illustrates
the opposing views of the evolutionist
and the reversionist, respecting
the main points in the controversy.</p>

<p>Suppose three crystals, similar in
shape, to have been formed in a solution.
The truncation of six of the
edges of each has, in some manner
or other, been effected. With these
edges thus reduced, the crystals are
found by a person anxious to prove
the theory of evolution. He places
them in solutions similar to those in
which they were formed. The development
of the lost edges then ensues.
But, instead of allowing them
all to develop, only a single edge in
each crystal is suffered to reproduce
itself; and this edge is in each crystal
a different one. This is done in order
to render the crystals as unlike as
possible. Practically, however, this
would be not a little difficult to effect.
Our friend, imbued with the inquiring
spirit of the age, now seeks to
ascertain the cause of the growth of
the edges. In his observation of the
phenomena of crystallization, he has
noticed that the growth of an edge
is often due to reproduction. But
this fact he now finds it convenient to
forget. He at last affects to believe
himself forced to conclude that the
growth of the edges is an ultimate
fact; and, at the same time, refers
the phenomenon to evolution, an explanation
which has the strong recommendation
of being a mere re-statement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">[661]</a></span>
of the phenomenon to be
explained. He next observes that,
in each crystal, a new angle develops
in correspondence with the angle first
developed. This gives him two characters
peculiar to each crystal. Recognizing
a new factor in the induced
development of the last angle, he
propounds the law of correlation, and
affirms that it concurs with and subserves
evolution. The three crystals,
originally alike, are now widely distinct.
These varieties of crystals, exclaims
our friend with the proud and
patronizing smile of conscious superiority,
present differences almost
equally great with those displayed by
species. Given, then, an indefinite
number of hours and the requisite
conditions, and all the species of crystals
can be shown to evolve one
from another. You cannot assume
a limit to the development of parts,
otherwise than gratuitously. There
cannot possibly be any such thing as
the immutability of the species; for
individuals vary, and the species is
composed of those individuals. This
argument of our friend cannot be
invalidated, if we concede that the
growth of the edges forming the peculiarities
of the varieties is new
growth, is evolution, and that it is
not reproduction. But it is obvious
that it is reproduction, or reversion
back to the state which existed previous
to the truncation of the edges.
It is equally obvious that correlation,
or the growth of the last edge in correspondence
with that of the former,
is merely a return to more perfect
coördination. It is also manifest to
every physicist, that the absence from
each crystal of the four edges which
constitute the peculiar characters of
the other varieties implies an imperfect
coördination of the remaining
parts. In other words, their absence
involves a departure from a state of
chemical integrity. For there can
be a normal distribution of the forces
of a crystal only when all the angles
and parts are present, and proportionately
developed. The views of
the evolutionist are therefore wholly
erroneous. For the principles of physics
preclude the possibility of the
normal existence of more than one
variety. The existence of a plurality
of varieties of a species implies disproportionate
development of some
of the parts. With crystals, however,
varieties may normally exist when
their differences are merely those of
size. But the only way in which the
relations of the parts can normally
be changed is by a totally new distribution
of the forces; which would
involve complete dissolution, a modification
of the force originally implied
in the deposition of the first molecule,
and reintegration. Now, just
as, in a crystal, the loss of any part
involves a departure from a state of
chemical integrity, so, in an organism,
the reduction, suppression, or
disproportionate development of any
part involves a departure from a state
of physiological integrity. In the perfect
type alone are the relations of
the different parts perfect. The only
way in which these relations could be
normally changed, is by complete dissolution
and new creation.</p>

<p>Not a little prejudice exists against
a perfect type. This prejudice is, in
a measure, justifiable, owing to the
vague and gratuitous manner in
which the perfect type has been assumed.
But it cannot reasonably be
extended to the perfect type which
we here assume. This, of ours, is
an individual in which all the characters
of the species are fully and proportionately
developed. It is no Platonic
idea; we assume it to prove it;
and it is no more metaphysical than
the assumption for a crystal of a
specific shape, which, owing to perturbations
of the forces of the solution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">[662]</a></span>
it has been incapable of attaining.</p>

<p>In "A Theory of Population," propounded
in <cite>The Westminster Review</cite>
for April, 1852, Mr. Herbert Spencer
defines life as "the coördination of
actions." This definition is, equally
with his others, exceedingly felicitous
in every respect but one. It is not a
definition of life, as it purports to be,
but merely a definition of the conditions
of life. In a note on page 74
of his <i>Principles of Biology</i>, wherein
he repels the imputation of being a
disciple of Comte, he declares that
the conditions <em>constitute</em> existence.
Recognizing the fact that the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">onus
probandi</i> rests upon him, he presents
phenomena in an aspect which at
first gives not a little plausibility to
his view. But these phenomena derive
all their significance from the circumstance
that Mr. Spencer's readers
concur in the conception of the evolution
of variations. When this conception
is demurred to, his arguments
lose all their force. The theory of
reversion negatives the validity of his
premises; and the hypothesis of the
conditions constituting existence is
then sustained by no proof greater
than that of gratuitous assertion.</p>

<p>But, whatever may be the diversity
of opinion respecting the truth of Mr.
Spencer's definition of life, there is
none, at least between him and us,
on the subject that "the coördination
of actions" is a definition of the conditions
of life. On this point both
he and we are fully agreed. His belief
that the definition is more than
that which we concede, is a matter
immaterial in connection with the argument
immediately to be adduced.
We wish now to observe which theory
consists more with the definition,
the theory of evolution or that of reversion.</p>

<p>The coördination of actions is the
attribute which characterizes all organisms.
All the parts of each organism
must work in concert. "If
one of them does too much or too little&mdash;that
is, if the coördination be imperfect&mdash;the
life is disturbed; and if
one of them ceases to act&mdash;that is, if
the coördination be destroyed&mdash;the life
is destroyed." These remarks of Mr.
Spencer more particularly refer to the
<i>vegetative system</i>; but, as he shows,
they are, with little modification, applicable
to the <i>animal system</i>. He
says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"How completely the several attributes
of animal life come within the definition, we
shall see on going through them <i>seriatim</i>.</p>

<p>"Thus, <em>strength</em> results from the coördination
of actions; for it is produced by the
simultaneous contraction of many muscles,
and many fibres of each muscle; and the
strength is great in proportion to the number
of these acting together; that is, in proportion
to the coördination. <em>Swiftness</em>, also,
depending partly on strength, but requiring,
also, the rapid alternation of movements,
equally comes under the expression;
seeing that, other things equal, the more
quickly sequent actions can be made to follow
each other, the more completely are
they coördinated. So, too, is it with <em>agility</em>;
the power of a chamois to spring from
crag to crag implies accurate coördination
in the movements of different muscles, and
a due subordination of them to the perceptions."</p></blockquote>

<p>On page 61 of his <i>Principles of
Biology</i>, he further assures us "that
arrest of coördination is death, and
that imperfect coördination is disease."</p>

<p>A superficial view of Mr. Spencer's
definition would involve the inference
that, upon the evolution hypothesis,
only one of two things is possible.
Either there is an ever-continuing
imperfect coördination, or there is an
always perfect coördination. As parts
subserve actions, the perfect coördination
of the latter must be dependent
upon the perfect coördination of
the former. Now, evolution implies
a constant change. In fact, according
to the hypothesis, constant change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">[663]</a></span>
is the only normal state. The variation
of parts, then, would entail their
imperfect coördination, and, consequently,
the imperfect coördination of
their actions; for the only conceivable
way in which the imperfect coördination
of actions is possible, is by a
change in the parts subserving those
actions. As variations, then, are ever
occurring, imperfect coördination must
always exist.</p>

<p>The following is the alternative
view. The evolutionist might assume
an ability in each organism to effect,
on the occurrence of each variation,
a re-coördination. This view manifestly
admits only of perfect coördination.
But the advocate of evolution
may avoid these absurd conclusions
by affirming, as he has tacitly
done, that, while the organism is capable
of coördinating any number
of characters, imperfect coördination
may ensue by a too sudden change
in any part or parts. This is the issue
which we desired to produce, the
decision of which will, we conceive, legitimately
preclude further argument.
The question is, Is the organism capable
of coördinating any number of
characters? or, are all the characters
of the species alone susceptible
of coördination? The reader will
perceive that the latter is a mere recurrence
of our proposition that the
proportionate development of all the
parts is necessary to perfection, and
that the absence of any part is deleterious
to the organism. If we prove
this, we shall have completely disproved
the evolution hypothesis.</p>

<p>There is a fact adduced by Darwin
which places the validity of our
theory beyond all doubt, and which
is, at the same time, grossly at variance
with the conception of evolution.
The fact to which we allude is, that
good results from crossing. Observing
this result, Darwin propounds a
general law of nature, that all organic
beings are benefited by an occasional
cross. This law he employs
as a somewhat important factor of
evolution, and essays to harmonize it
with his theory. In this attempt he
succeeds. But mere congruity with
a law is no proof of the validity of
a theory, where that law is only an
empirical one. Of this every person
conversant with science is aware. It
is equally well known, however, that
when a theory is shown to accord
with a law; to furnish an explanation
of it; and to resolve it into a higher
law, thus changing it from an empirical
into a derivative law; proof conclusive
and incontrovertible has been
adduced. If the reader has not already
mentally anticipated our argument,
it remains for us to prove that
the theory of reversion fulfils these
requirements.</p>

<p>Our theory manifestly implies that
the more proportionate the development,
the greater is the approach to
perfection. It also implies that the
more characters of the species there
are in each variety, the nearer is the approximation
to perfect coördination.
It is apparent at a glance, then, that
crossing furnishes a crucial test of the
truth of our views. For most varieties
are distinguished from each other
by the possession of positive features.
The presence of the peculiar character
of one variety, of course, implies its
absence in the others. Each variety
possesses a character or characters
which the others lack, and lacks what
the others peculiarly possess. When,
then, two such varieties cross, good
must of necessity accrue to their offspring.
For, in the formation of the
latter, each variety supplies a deficiency
of the other. Could a reason be
more obvious? or could proof of a
view be more conclusive? So conclusive
is it, we conceive, that were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">[664]</a></span>
any other result consequent on crossing,
such a circumstance would be at
variance with our theory.</p>

<p>Of the fact that good results from
crossing, not a doubt can reasonably
be entertained. Darwin, so far from
questioning the fact, is its most strenuous
advocate. But upon his conception,
it is crossing <i>per se</i> which produces
the favorable effects. In other
words, this is another of Darwin's ultimate
laws. Being purely empirical,
the general law of nature which he
assumes, fails utterly to explain the
cause of the variations in the quantity
of the effects. The crossing of
pigeons, for instance, is attended
by the greatest gain in constitutional
vigor, while comparatively little good
results from the crossing of the varieties
of the horse, sheep, or cow. On
our doctrine, the explanation is clear.
The many widely distinct varieties of
the pigeon necessarily imply great disproportionate
development of each.
They are, then, extremely susceptible
of improvement. The races of the
horse, sheep, and cow, on the other
hand, approximate, as we have seen,
to proportionate development. There
is, therefore, much less room for improvement.
Strikingly in harmony
with this interpretation is the fact
that, with pigeons, the more highly
bred the crossed varieties are, the
greater is the gain from a cross.
Equally congruous is the fact that the
more highly bred the breeds of the
horse, cow, and sheep are, the less is
the gain. The reason is, careful and
select breeding produces increased
divergence of character with pigeons;
but with horses, sheep, and cattle it
induces increased convergence. The
former become widely distinct, while
the latter converge in character. All
the characters are developed in each
variety of the latter; but in the former
different characters are developed in
different varieties. While, then, coördination
in the horse, sheep, and
cow advances toward perfection, coördination
in the pigeon is rendered
more imperfect by careful breeding.
Each variety of the pigeon possesses
a character which, when joined with
those of another variety, will entail a
great advance toward due coördination.
This concurrence is effected
by crossing, and the result is, as one
would be led to expect upon our doctrine,
great beneficial effects. With
the horse, sheep, and cow the effects
of a cross between varieties are less
marked, owing to less imperfect previous
coördination.</p>

<p>In noting the advantage accruing
to crossed offspring, we have particularly
referred to gain in constitutional
vigor. We have occasion now to
speak of gain in fertility. Seeing that
hybrids&mdash;the product of a cross between
species&mdash;are invariably sterile,
it is clear that, if the conception that
varieties are incipient species is a
valid one, we are bound to expect
that the more marked, distinct, and
widely divergent varieties are, the
greater will be their sterility. The
mere circumstance that such an effect
is not observable, goes far to invalidate
the conception. What, then,
must the inference be when an effect
diametrically opposite to that necessitated
by the conception is shown
to result&mdash;when increased fertility is
seen to follow crossing, and when
this increased fertility is observed to
be directly proportionate to divergence
of character? Such results
would, we apprehend, negative completely
the hypothesis of evolution,
and would conclusively confirm our
view, that the beneficial effects are
owing to the disproportionate development
which a multiplicity of widely
distinct varieties necessarily implies.
These results we have, and they are
indisputable. For the fact that crossing
induces increased fertility, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">[665]</a></span>
that this increased fertility is directly
proportionate to divergence of character,
is so well known that it is
scarcely necessary to adduce proofs
from Darwin in support of it. But
that the least shadow of a doubt may
not remain, we will quote a few of
Darwin's remarks on the subject.</p>

<p>Constant reference to crossing may
be found in any portion of his late
work. But a somewhat lengthy chapter
is devoted exclusively to this subject
and to close interbreeding. In
the conclusion of this chapter (p. 142,
vol. ii.) he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the early part of this chapter it was
shown that the crossing of distinct forms,
whether closely or distantly allied, gives increased
size and constitutional vigor, and, except
in the case of crossed species, increased
fertility to the offspring. The evidence
rests on the universal testimony of breeders....
Although animals of pure
blood will obviously be deteriorated by crossing,
as far as their characteristic qualities are
concerned, there seems to be no exception
to the rule that advantages of the kind just
mentioned are thus gained even when there
has not been any previous close interbreeding.
The rule applies to all animals, <i>even
to cattle and sheep</i>, which can long resist
breeding in-and-in between the nearest blood
relations. It applies to individuals of the
same sub-variety, but of distinct families,
to varieties or races, to sub-species, as well
as to quite distinct species.</p>

<p>"In this latter case, however, while size,
vigor, precocity, and hardiness are, with
rare exceptions, gained, fertility, in a greater
or less degree, is lost; but the gain cannot
be exclusively attributed to the principle
of compensation; for there is no close parallelism
between the increased size and vigor
of the offspring and their sterility. Moreover,
it has been clearly proved that mongrels
which are perfectly fertile gain these
same advantages, as well as sterile hybrids."</p></blockquote>

<p>On page 174, he reiterates these statements,
which place the subject of increased
fertility beyond all doubt.</p>

<p>Now, it is clear that Darwin's being
necessitated particularly to note
that the rule that advantage results
from crossing obtains even in the
cases of cattle and sheep, implies that
comparatively little good accrues to
the offspring from the crossing of the
breeds of either of those animals.
This shows, as the varieties of the
sheep and cow are convergent in character,
that the less divergent the varieties
the less is the good attendant
on crossing. The converse, that the
more divergent the varieties the greater
the good, is plainly seen in the case
of the pigeon, of which the varieties
are manifestly and confessedly the
most divergent. The following assertions
are unequivocal proof of our
view:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"All the domestic races pair readily together,
and, what is equally important, their
mongrel offspring are perfectly fertile. To
ascertain this fact, I made many experiments,
which are given in the note below; and recently
Mr. Tegetmeier has made similar experiments
with the same result. The accurate
Neumeister asserts that when dovecots
are crossed with pigeons of any other breed
the mongrels are extremely fertile and hardy.
MM. Boitard and Corbie affirm, after
their great experience, <i>that with crossed pigeons,
the more distinct the breeds, the more
productive are their mongrel offspring</i>." (Page
236, vol i., American edition.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Mere mention of crossing in connection
with our theory would, we
conceive, suffice. But if any doubts
have been entertained of the conclusiveness
of the proofs furnished by
the law, or of the competency of the
theory of reversion to account for the
good resulting from crossing, they are
now surely dissipated by the evidence
adduced from Darwin. The law of
crossing which we propound is no ultimate
law. It fulfils every requirement
of a derivative law. The good
which flows from crossing varies in
degree in different animals, as is well
known. This is quite explicable upon
our theory; and the amount of good
accruing to the offspring from the
union of two given varieties, is even susceptible
of prevision. Crossing <i>per se</i>
does not produce the increased good;
it is attributable to the lack of full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">[666]</a></span>
and proportionate development. Of
course, for increased good to result,
each of the crossed animals must contribute
to the formation of the offspring
a part or parts which the other
lacks. We have, then, given what
Darwin's law, being purely empirical,
is utterly incompetent to do&mdash;a rational
and consistent interpretation
of the variations in the quantity of
the effects. Logic requires no greater
proofs of a theory than those which
we have here adduced.</p>

<p>Darwin has informed us, in his late
invaluable work, that crossing induces
the appearance of new characters.
Great stress is laid upon this fact by
several writers, and some of them,
among whom Pallas is conspicuous,
have even gone so far as to ascribe
variability exclusively to crossing.
The theory of reversion furnishes a
rational explanation of the appearance
of these characters. We do not allude
merely to the fact that their reversion
is more probable than their
evolution; for Darwin inclines to this
opinion rather than to the contrary
one. On page 264, vol. ii., after demurring
to the conception that variability
is solely induced by crossing,
he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Nevertheless, it is probable that the
crossing of two forms, when one or both
have long been domesticated or cultivated,
adds to the variability of the offspring, independently
of the commingling of the characters
derived from the two parent forms; and
this implies that new characters actually arise.
But we must not forget the facts advanced
in the thirteenth chapter, which clearly prove
that the act of crossing often leads to the reappearance
or reversion of long-lost characters;
and in most cases, it would be impossible
to distinguish between the reappearance
of ancient characters and the first appearance
of new characters. Practically,
whether new or old, they would be new to
the breed in which they reappeared."</p></blockquote>

<p>But there is another factor subserving
evolution, to which we particularly
allude. This is correlation,
which we have seen reason to conclude
exists, not only between different
growths, but also between different
centres of growth. Now, when
a cross ensues, the offspring generally
acquires from each parent a character
or characters which the other lacks.
The union of these characters strengthens
the centres to which they are joined,
and also all the centres of which
the related parts are developed. By
correlation, the centre to which these
centres are most closely allied becomes
more firmly established. The
more firm establishment of this centre,
then, induces the development of
its formerly connected parts. These
parts are the characters consequent
upon crossing.</p>

<p>If, as we maintain, the proofs furnished
by crossing are conclusive, then
the phenomena of close interbreeding
must be proofs amounting to demonstration.
For the law of close interbreeding,
which is the converse of
that of crossing, also holds good; is, if
possible, more in accordance with the
theory of reversion; is also susceptible
of resolution into the law of proportionate
development; and, being
a derivative law upon our theory, fully
accounts for all the variations in
the quantity of the effects. The different
data, moreover, esteemed so
mutually inconsistent, of those who
concur in and of those who demur to
Darwin's law of close interbreeding,
can be shown, by the light furnished
by the hypothesis of proportionate
development, to be perfectly congruous.
If we can prove, then, that
our law of close interbreeding, founded
upon the facts furnished by Darwin,
is capable of all this, we shall
have fulfilled our promise to place our
theory beyond the reach of cavil.</p>

<p>As has been more than once asserted,
our views necessitate the conclusion
that a multiplicity of divergent
varieties implies the loss in each of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">[667]</a></span>
what constitute the peculiar characteristics
of the others. The circumstance
that some few varieties are
distinguished by the possession of negative
features, but slightly modifies
this conclusion. Now, it is clear to
the comprehension of every one who
is likely to have followed us this far,
that, as the loss of any part or character
is deleterious, the pairing of
the members of a variety would tend
to aggravate the evil consequent on
the absence of the peculiar characters
of the other varieties.</p>

<p>Quite in harmony with this view
is the following assertion, one of a
vast number of a similar kind made
by Darwin: "The consequences of
close interbreeding, carried on for too
long a time, are, as is generally believed,
loss of size, constitutional vigor,
and fertility, sometimes accompanied
by a tendency to malformation."
(Page 115, vol. ii.)</p>

<p>Now, according to our theory, the
evil effects of close interbreeding must
be proportionate to the divergence of
character; or, rather, to the disproportionate
development which divergence
involves. Darwin admits that
different species of animals are differently
affected by the same degree of
interbreeding. Among species of
which the varieties are divergent, the
pigeon and fowl are preëminently conspicuous.
Here, then, we must look
for the greatest evil effects from the
interbreeding of the members of the
varieties. The facts fail not to realize
our anticipations. No writers
have expressed so strong a conviction
of the impossibility of long-continued
interbreeding as Sir J. Sebright and
Andrew Knight, who have paid the
most attention to the breeding of the
fowl and pigeon. Darwin gives us, as
the result of his wide experience and
extensive research, the following opinion:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Evidence of the evil effects of close interbreeding
can most readily be acquired in
the case of animals, such as fowls, pigeons,
etc., which propagate quickly, and, from being
kept in the same place, are exposed to
the same conditions. Now, I have inquired
of very many breeders of these birds, and I
have hitherto not met with a single man who
was not thoroughly convinced that an occasional
cross with another strain of the same
sub-variety was absolutely necessary. Most
breeders of highly improved or fancy birds
value their own strain, and are most unwilling,
at the risk, in their opinion, of deterioration,
to make a cross. The purchase of a
first-rate bird of another strain is expensive,
and exchanges are troublesome; yet all
breeders, as far as I can hear, excepting
those who keep large stocks at different
places for the sake of crossing, are driven
after a time to take this step." (P. 117,
vol. ii.)</p></blockquote>

<p>And again, on page 125, he says:
"With pigeons, breeders are unanimous,
as previously stated, that it is absolutely
indispensable, notwithstanding
the trouble and expense thus
caused, occasionally to cross their
much-prized birds with individuals of
another strain, but belonging, of course,
to the same variety." He then dwells
at some length upon the great delicacy
of constitution entailed by the
close interbreeding of nearly-related
pigeons, and mentions a circumstance
for which the reason is at once obvious
upon our theory. He says, "It
deserves notice that, when large size
is one of the desired characters, as with
pouters, the evil effects of close interbreeding
are much sooner perceived
than when small birds, such as short-faced
tumblers, are desired."</p>

<p>"In the case of the <i>fowl</i>," says Darwin,
"a whole array of authorities
could be given against too close interbreeding."
(P. 124, vol. ii.) Following
this assertion is mention of
the great sterility of bantams, induced
by close interbreeding. He assures
us that he has seen silver bantams
almost as barren as hybrids. The
Sebright bantam is destitute of hackles
and sickle tail-feathers. This involves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">[668]</a></span>
disproportionate development;
and that the evil is attributable to
this, Darwin virtually admits when he
says, on page 101, that the loss of
fertility is to be ascribed "either to
long-continued, close interbreeding,
or to an innate tendency to sterility
correlated with the absence of hackles
and sickle tail-feathers."</p>

<p>Of all the phenomena attendant
upon close interbreeding, we know
of none which so strikingly confirms
our view as the following curious
case. It is a most delicate exemplification
of our doctrine. "Mr. Hewitt
says that with these bantams the
sterility of the male stands, with rare
exceptions, in the closest relation with
their loss of certain secondary male
characters;" he adds, "I have noticed,
as a general rule, that even the
slightest deviation from feminine character
in the tail of the male Sebright&mdash;say
the elongation <em>by only half an
inch</em> of the two principal tail-feathers&mdash;brings
with it improved probability
of increased fertility." (Pp. 124.) The
full significance of this singular fact
the reader will at once appreciate.
For the cause of the phenomenon is
obvious. The increased probability
of fertility, consequent on the growth
of the secondary sexual characters, is
owing to the induced return to proportionate
development.</p>

<p>Darwin says, "There is reason to
believe, and this was the opinion of
that most experienced observer, Sir
J. Sebright, that the evil effects of
close interbreeding may be checked
by the related individuals being separated
during a few generations and
exposed to different conditions of life."
(Pp. 115.) Now, different conditions
are, as we have seen, favorable to
the development of different parts.
Exposure, then, to conditions other
than those to which their brothers
are subjected, would lead to the
growth or strengthening of certain
parts in the separated animals. Interbreeding
between members of the
two lots of animals would, in consequence,
be equivalent to crossing.
The check to the evil effects is to be
attributed to a slight dissimilarity of
structure.</p>

<p>These quotations from Darwin
place beyond doubt the fact that the
greatest evil effects flow from the close
interbreeding of fowls and pigeons.
It now remains for us to show that,
in animals which are comparatively
proportionately developed, the evil
effects are very small. It must be
observed that it does not rest with us
to show a total absence of evil. For
no animals are, in all respects, proportionately
developed. Our very ability
to discriminate between different
breeds necessarily implies the disproportionate
development of all but one
of them; that is, when their differences
are not merely those of size.
With cows, want of proportion is often
caused by blind conformity in certain
breeds to certain standards. Thus,
when a breed acquires a reputation,
all its points are faithfully preserved,
as if the preservation intact of the existing
condition of all the features was
a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine qua non</i> of the animal's good
quality; and this occurs even when
some of the features are shockingly
out of proportion, or greatly reduced.
If one breed were fully and proportionately
developed, the others could
be distinguished from it only by negative
features.</p>

<p>Of the close interbreeding of the
cow Darwin says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"With <em>cattle</em> there can be no doubt that
extremely close interbreeding may be long
carried on, advantageously with respect to
external characters and with no manifestly
apparent evil as far as constitution is concerned.
The same remark is applicable to
sheep. Whether these animals have been
rendered less susceptible than others to this
evil, in order to permit them to live in herds&mdash;a
habit which leads the old and vigorous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">[669]</a></span>
males to expel all intruders, and in consequence
often to pair with their own daughters&mdash;I
will not pretend to decide. The
case of Bakewell's longhorns, which were
closely interbred for a long period, has often
been quoted; yet Youatt says the breed 'had
acquired a delicacy of constitution inconsistent
with common management,' and 'the
propagation of the species was not always
certain.' But the shorthorns offer the most
striking case of close interbreeding; for
instance, the famous bull Favorite (who
was himself the offspring of a half-brother
and sister from Foljambe) was matched
with his own daughter, granddaughter, and
great-granddaughter; so that the produce
of this last union, or the great-great-granddaughter,
had fifteen sixteenths, or 93.75
per cent, of the blood of Favorite in her
reins. This cow was matched with the bull
Wellington, having 62.5 per cent of Favorite
blood in his veins, and produced Clarissa;
Clarissa was matched with the bull
Lancaster, having 68.75 of the same blood,
and she yielded valuable offspring. Nevertheless,
Collings, who reared these animals,
and was a strong advocate for close interbreeding,
once crossed his stock with a Galloway,
and the cows from this cross realized
the highest prices. Bates's herd was esteemed
the most celebrated in the world.
For thirteen years he bred most closely in-and-in;
but during the next seventeen years,
though he had the most exalted notion of
the value of his own stock, he thrice infused
fresh blood into his herd; it is said that he
did this, not to improve the form of his animals,
but on account of their lessened fertility.
Mr. Bates's own view, as given by a
celebrated breeder, was, that 'to breed in-and-in
from a bad stock was ruin and devastation;
yet that the practice may be safely
allowed within certain limits when the parents
so related are descended from first-rate
animals.' We thus see that there has
been extremely close interbreeding with
shorthorns; but Nathusius, after the most
careful study of their pedigrees, says that
he can find no instance of a breeder who has
strictly followed this practice during his
whole life. From this study and his own
experience, he concludes that close interbreeding
is necessary to ennoble the stock;
but that in effecting this the greatest care
is necessary on account of the tendency to
infertility and weakness. It may be added
that another high authority asserts that many
more calves are born cripples from shorthorns
than from any other and less closely
interbred races of cattle." (Pp. 117, 118,
vol. ii.)</p></blockquote>

<p>This last phenomenon is doubtless
due to correlation between the legs
and the small development of the
horns.</p>

<p>Now, these remarks of Mr. Darwin
unequivocally show that extremely
long-continued close interbreeding
is possible with cattle. They also acquaint
us with the fact that, although
this may long be carried on, evil at
length begins to manifest itself. This
is easily explained. A small want of
proportion in the animals interbred
entails evil, but evil too small in
amount to be capable of manifesting
itself at once. But continued exacerbations,
consequent on frequent
pairing with related individuals possessing
an evil identical in kind, so
augments the evil as eventually to involve
its display.</p>

<p>If further proof of the possibility
of the long-continued interbreeding
of cattle is needed, it may be found
on page 44 of <cite>The Westminster Review</cite>
for July, 1863. This review is
the stronghold of Darwinism. The
writer of the article to which we refer
says, that "Dr. Child gives the
pedigree of the celebrated bull Comet
and of some other animals, bred with
a degree of closeness such as no one
who has not studied the subject would
believe possible. In one of these
cases, the same animal appears as the
sire in <em>four</em> successive generations."
So striking is the pedigree of Comet,
that the writer cannot refrain from inserting
it.</p>

<p>The sheep is another animal in
which there is an approximation to
proportionate development. Let us
see, then, if our doctrine equally obtains
in this case. Before going further,
we may request the reader to
call to mind Darwin's assurance that
his remark, "that extremely close interbreeding
may be long carried on
with cattle," is equally applicable to
sheep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">[670]</a></span></p>

<p>On page 119, vol. ii., he remarks
that,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"With <em>sheep</em> there has often been long-continued
close interbreeding within the
limits of the same flock; but whether the
nearest relations have been matched so frequently
as in the case of shorthorn cattle, I
do not know. The Messrs. Brown, during
fifty years, have never infused fresh blood
into their excellent flock of Leicesters. Since
1810, Mr. Barford has acted on the same
principle with the Foscote flock. He asserts
that half a century of experience has
convinced him that when two nearly-related
individuals are quite sound in constitution,
in-and-in breeding does not induce degeneracy;
but he adds that he 'does not pride
himself on breeding from the nearest affinities.'
In France, the Naz flock has been
bred for sixty years without the introduction
of a single strange ram."</p></blockquote>

<p>In connection with this subject
<cite>The Westminster Review</cite> says that,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"M. Beaudouin, in a memoir to be found
in the <i>Comptes Rendus</i> of August 5th, 1862,
gives some very interesting particulars of a
flock of merino sheep bred in-and-in, for a
period of two and twenty years, without a
single cross, and with perfectly successful
results, there being no sign of decreased fertility,
and the breed having in other respects
improved."</p></blockquote>

<p>Of all animals, the horse is manifestly
the most proportionately developed.
In him all the parts maintain,
to a great extent, the due proportions.
Our doctrine, then, leads us to expect
that, in this case, little evil results
from close interbreeding. We would
be greatly surprised that the horse
was not the most striking instance of
the possibility of long-continued in-and-in
breeding, were we not conscious
of the fact that a great portion
of the evil eventually resulting
from close interbreeding is attributable
to augmentation of the diseases
to which the horse is singularly susceptible.
The following is the only
evidence we shall adduce in the case
of the horse; but it "is clear and decisive":</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mr. J. H. Walsh, well known, under
the <i>nom de plume</i> of Stonehenge, as an authority
upon sporting matters, says distinctly,
in his recent work, that nearly all our
thorough-bred horses are bred in-and-in."
(<cite>Vide West. Rev.</cite> for July, 1863, p. 44.)</p>

<p>"Writers upon sporting matters are pretty
generally agreed that no horse either
bears fatigue so well or recovers from its effects
so soon as the thorough-bred, and it
is a subject upon which such writers are the
best of all authorities. Thus, 'Nimrod' concludes
a comparison between the thorough-bred
and the half-bred hunter in the following
words: 'As for his powers of endurance
under equal sufferings, they doubtless would
exceed those of the 'cock-tail,' and being by
his nature what is termed a better doer in
the stable, he is sooner at his work again
than the others. <i>Indeed, there is scarcely a
limit to the work of full-bred hunters</i> of good
form and constitution and temper; and yet
these, as we have seen, are almost all close
bred." (<i>Ibid.</i> p. 45.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The mention of "good form" is a
fact of significance; for the current
conception of symmetry is, in the
case of the horse, a safer criterion of
proportionate development than in
the case of any other animal.</p>

<p>In all the discussions on close interbreeding,
no case meets with such frequent
mention as that of the pig.
Those who endeavor to gainsay the
conclusion that evil is attendant on in-and-in
breeding, signally fail to invalidate
the fact that pigs die out altogether
after being bred in-and-in for several
generations. Those persons are the
exceptions, however, who consider
the fact as questionable. On page
121, vol. ii., Darwin says, "With
<em>pigs</em> there is more unanimity among
breeders on the evil effects of close
interbreeding than, perhaps, with any
other large animal." He then gives
quite a number of facts, which we will
not quote, as they are indisputable.</p>

<p>Close interbreeding being attended,
in pigs, by evil effects is, at first sight,
at variance with our doctrine. For,
not only does utility guide the selection
of pigs, but they are, as Darwin
has informed us, the most striking instance
of convergence of character.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">[671]</a></span>
We have seen the greatest evil effects
of in-and-in breeding in those species
in which selection is guided by
fancy, and of which the varieties were
the most divergent in character. A
superficial consideration, then, would
lead one to expect that, where the
converse obtained&mdash;where utility was
the motive in selection, and where
the varieties were convergent in character&mdash;interbreeding
would entail little
or no evil effects. But the incongruity
between the facts and the doctrine
is only apparent, not real. There
is presence of evil effects, because, in
this case, the motive of utility and
convergence of character also involve
disproportionate development. Disproportionate
development is the only
never-failing criterion. In our last
article we showed that, while divergence
of character is solely caused
by disproportionate development, convergence
of character may be induced
by either proportionate or disproportionate
development. We further
showed that the pig's convergence of
character is caused by disproportionate
development, and that the pig
has many characters either wholly
or partially suppressed. Its coat of
bristles is greatly diminished, and its
tusks are wholly reduced. Owing to
a misguided policy, its legs are of the
smallest possible size, and, by correlation,
the front of the head is remarkably
short and concave. Being,
then, thus disproportionately developed,
the pig, of all large animals, must
be, upon our doctrine, the most susceptible
of evil from close interbreeding.
Allow the legs to be of proportionate
size, and a marked decrease
in the evil entailed by interbreeding
will be observable. So impressed are
we with the idea of the truth of our
doctrine, that we will stake its validity
upon the result, confident that, in
doing so, we venture nothing.</p>

<p>That the cause assigned for the
lessened fertility and delicacy of constitution
of pigs is a true one, is placed
beyond all doubt by the fact that,
with those members of the species
of which but little care is taken, there
is comparatively very little evil entailed
by close interbreeding. The reason
lies in the circumstance that, in
these animals, the legs are far more
proportionately developed than in
well-bred pigs; and that there is absent
the shortness and concavity of
the front of the head. The more well-bred
the animals, the greater are the
injurious effects of in-and-in breeding.
This fact needs not proof; it is too
well known. Care in breeding pigs
almost invariably induces the small
development of the legs and of the
front of the head. A case somewhat
analogous is presented by the fowl
and pigeon. With them, the more
careful the selection, the greater are
the evil effects of interbreeding. With
cattle, sheep, and horses, however,
good breeding is a condition <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine qua
non</i> of their exemption from the evil
generally consequent on close interbreeding.
Why care should be attended
by different results in different
species, is at first not clear. But this
is the explanation. In fowls and
pigeons, care in the formation of varieties
induces greater disproportionate
development by augmenting the
divergence of character. In cattle,
sheep, and horses, on the contrary,
care, by inducing greater convergence,
causes increased proportionate development.
This convergence, be it remembered,
is attributable to a cause
other than that which creates the
convergence of character of the breeds
of well-bred pigs.</p>

<p>We incline to believe that the extremely
small amount of evil attendant
on reduced size never manifests
itself by close interbreeding. That
some evil, though inappreciably small,
does result from reduced size, may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[672]</a></span>
reasonably be inferred from the fact
that, where animals disproportionately
developed are crossed, increase in
size follows, and that, where those
animals are closely interbred, decrease
in size results.</p>

<p>We are assured that there are cases
in which crossing, instead of resulting
in good, induces evil effects. Darwin
says he has not met with any
well-established case, with animals, in
which this occurs. Now, our theory
contemplates such evil effects under
the following circumstances. The
varieties crossed must each be distinguished
from other varieties by a negative
feature. In addition to this,
they must lack features in common.
The evil resulting would then be attributable
to the same cause which induces
the evil consequent on close interbreeding.</p>

<p>It is now clear that these phenomena
of crossing and close interbreeding
tell a tale the direct converse and refutation
of that which Darwin would
have us believe. They are manifestly,
grossly, absolutely, and irreconcilably
at variance with the doctrine of
evolution. They show conclusively
that no divergence of character is
normally possible; that all the characters
of the species are alone susceptible
of perfect coördination; that
the exclusive possession of any positive
character by any variety is to the
detriment of the other varieties; that
the possession of any negative feature
is deleterious to the organism; and
that there can normally exist but one
variety&mdash;the perfect type, that variety
in which all the positive features are
fully and proportionately developed.
These conclusions cannot be gainsaid;
for they irresistibly force themselves
upon one by observation of the
phenomena of crossing and close interbreeding,
furnished by Darwin.</p>

<p>We have now propounded a counter-theory
and a refutation of Darwinism.
In doing so, we have introduced
no new factors. We have used
only those with which Darwin has
furnished us. There are, however,
three factors recognized by Darwin
which we have eliminated. These
are an innate tendency in organisms
to vary, evolution, and the law of
compensation of growth. Of these,
the first is confessedly unscientific;
the second, irrespective of the well-founded
doubt as to whether it obtains
or not, must share in the same
discredit which is accorded to the
first; and the third is viewed with
distrust even by Darwin himself.
The factors, however, which we have
retained must be conceded to be immeasurably
more amenable to the canons
of scientific research, upon the
theory of reversion, than when they
are adduced to subserve the hypothesis
of evolution. In our treatment of
them they have fulfilled the highest
requirements of logic. Take, for example,
the four principal laws involved
in the controversy&mdash;variation, correlation,
crossing, and close interbreeding.
These we found ultimate
or empirical laws, and left them derivative
laws. The law of variation we
resolved into the law of reversion;
and the laws of correlation, crossing,
and close interbreeding we resolved
into the law of proportionate development.
Now, it is not possible for
a theory to be capable of all this, and
yet to be false. If the laws upon
which we based our theory were merely
empirical, a doubt of its validity
might reasonably be entertained. But,
as the case stands, it cannot.</p>

<p>But&mdash;may exclaim a tyro who affects
a love for science, and whose conception
of biology is limited to protoplasm
and cells&mdash;assuming that the
hypothesis of reversion is vastly more
conformable to the phenomena of variation
than the hypothesis of evolution,
yet your theory fails to supply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">[673]</a></span>
the greatest requirement of biologic
science. It fails to satisfy our yearnings
after a knowledge of the development
of the species. Darwin starts
with cells, the lowest congregations
of organic matter. Because he does
this his theory is, at least philosophically,
the more scientific.</p>

<p>But, even in this respect, our theory
is more philosophical than that of
Darwin. Darwin assumes three or
four cells, and intrusts spontaneity or
chance with the development of the
species. We assume, not "a myriad
supernatural impulses" going to the
formation of each species, not the
creation of each species in its maturity,
but one cell alone for each species,
(or, perhaps, one cell for each sex of
each species.) For evidence of the
fact that the assumption of a multiplicity
of cells is more philosophical
than the assumption of only three or
four, we appeal to an article in the
<cite>North American Review</cite> for October,
1868, entitled "Philosophical Biology,"
of which the writer is a professed
Darwinian, and to G. H. Lewes's
articles in the <cite>Fortnightly Review</cite>.
Given, then, these cells, we intrust the
development of the species, not to
spontaneity or chance, but to the operation
of laws similar to those obtaining
in the crystal. The forces implied
in the creation, formation, or existence
of each cell determine, as in
the case of the crystal, the whole
form and structure of the species.
The process of development is that
predetermined, from which no departure
is normally possible. Time,
however, is an unimportant element.
This kind of evolution of the species
we concede. That which we deny is
the evolution of the species one from
another.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we cannot refrain
from stating that our views are quite
consistent with a high admiration of
the great ingenuity and vast research
displayed by Mr. Darwin. His desire
to be frank and candid none can
gainsay. For the ability of Mr. Spencer,
who is somewhat less candid, but
immeasurably more so than the petty
retailers of his conceptions, we have
the deepest respect. His exquisitely
constructed mind we ever delight to
study. Both Mr. Darwin and Mr.
Spencer have rendered great services
to the cause of science. And we
must in candor admit that the British
"infidels" generally present their
theories in a form which admits of
their eventual confirmation, or their
eventual refutation. As we are confident
that their refutation will follow
whenever they are really at variance
with religion, we anticipate with pleasure
many a warm but amicable controversy
within the next half-century.</p>

<h2>BRITISH PREMIERS IN RELATION TO BRITISH
CATHOLICS.</h2>


<p>The English parliament having
lately occupied itself in discussing a
measure of the utmost importance to
the Catholics of the United Kingdom,
and to Irish Catholics in particular&mdash;the
abolition of the Established
Church supremacy, the time seems
very opportune for reviewing the
conduct of British premiers for the
last century and a half in reference
to Catholics. The subject, we
think, cannot fail to interest our
readers, whether they be natives of
this soil of freedom, or whether they
have emigrated from an isle where
freedom was, during long ages, unknown,
and have sought on this side
of the Atlantic that liberty, prosperity,
and peace from which in Ireland
they were cruelly debarred.</p>

<p>Though the revolution of 1688
filled the breasts of Catholics with
dismay, and the ruin of their cause
seemed complete, when the arms of
William of Orange prevailed at the
Boyne and at Limerick, yet their situation
was not so forlorn nor were their
prospects so hopeless as might have
been expected. Many circumstances
alleviated their misery; and, stormy
as was the landscape spread before
their eyes, glimpses were ever and
anon afforded them of that tranquil
and sunny horizon into which, after
so many toils and conflicts, wounds
and tears, they now seem to be entering.
Every premier since the revolution
down to the present time has
done something, directly or indirectly,
conducive to their interests, and calculated
to raise them to equal privileges
with the rest of their fellow-countrymen,
if not to restore them to
their long lost ascendency.</p>

<p>William III. was decidedly averse
to persecution, and whether from
coldness or kindness of disposition,
he could never be induced by any of
his counsellors to trample on the
liberty of one portion of his subjects
in order merely to please another
portion. There was, indeed, one act
of his reign,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
of which we shall speak
more particularly when we arrive at
Lord North's ministry, that pressed
very heavily on English and Irish
Catholics; but of this act, which was
never carried fully into execution, the
nation became weary in eighty years,
and William's consent to it was given
very unwillingly. The known moderation
of his own views was probably
one reason why the pope (Alexander
VIII.) did not disdain to give him
his moral support in the league
against France, and to be secretly,
though not openly, one of the alliance
formed against ambition and
encroachments which the states of
Europe in general felt to be intolerable.
When his approval of the Declaration
of Indulgence was sought by
James II., in 1687, he had answered
that he and the princess must protest
against it, as exceeding the king's
lawful prerogative, and as being dangerous
to the Protestant ascendency,
because it admitted Catholics to offices
of trust; but he added that "they
were not persecutors. They should
with pleasure see Roman Catholics
as well as Protestant dissenters relieved,
in a proper manner, from all
penal statutes. They should with
pleasure see Protestant dissenters admitted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">[675]</a></span>
in a proper manner to civil
office. But at that point their highnesses
must stop."<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>
Such being William's
sentiments, it is much to be
regretted that he did not firmly resist
the persecutive act which disgraces
his reign, and which, far from mitigating
the penal statutes in force
against Catholics, made them more
severe, and stood in direct contrast
to his well-known and often expressed
convictions.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
But not only was King William
himself favorable to Catholic liberties,
nearly one half of the Lords, the Commons,
and the people in general, were
Jacobites, or inclined to Jacobitism.
Many of the great measures which decided
the course of the English government
in a Protestant and anti-Stuart
direction were passed by extremely
small majorities, and not a few of
those who held offices of the highest
trust in William's government, who
commanded his armies and fleets, and
sat by him at the council-board, were
privately negotiating with King
James and receiving the nightly visits
of messengers from St. Germain.
Such were Russell, Godolphin, and
Marlborough; and when men so
high in the state were thus striving
to serve two masters, those Catholics
who became aware of their intrigues
could not but cherish bright hopes
that the day of their own redemption
was drawing nigh. During the reign
of Queen Anne these hopes rose yet
higher. She had a brother who
claimed the throne of England, and
she desired that he might be her successor.
There were few at the time
who knew the inmost thoughts of her
heart; but it was evident to all that
she leaned to the Jacobites; and
when statesmen like Oxford and Bolingbroke,
and a bishop like Atterbury,
stood high in her favor, it was manifest
to Catholics that her royal mind
turned wistfully toward the Catholic
dynasty. The rigorous measures
which had been passed against Catholics
in her predecessor's reign remained,
for the most part, a dead letter
during hers. Anne herself was
no bigot; and if the country had not
been kept in constant alarm by a
threatened Stuart rising, the Catholic
population would have enjoyed great
tranquillity and considerable freedom.
In 1714, we find Lord Bolingbroke
writing that the Catholics enjoy as
much quiet as any others of the
queen's subjects.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
But this assertion,
it must be admitted, loses part of its
credit when we remember that the
oppressive measures enacted at various
times under William and Mary
were followed by several fresh refinements
of cruelty in the reign of
Anne.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>When the peaceful accession of the
Elector of Hanover to the throne of
England darkened the prospects of
the Jacobites, and suggested to them
the adoption of desperate steps as
the only remedy for their disappointment,
the government was sorely
tempted to subject all Catholics to
rigorous laws, and to render existing
statutes still more severe. To this
temptation, however, happily, it did
not yield except in one or two instances.
The mind of Sir Robert
Walpole was neither persecutive nor
narrow. He had, shortly before
Queen Anne's demise, opposed the
odious Schism Act, by which every
tutor and schoolmaster in Great Britain
was compelled to receive the
sacrament in the Established Church,
obtain a license from the Protestant
bishop, and pledge himself in writing
to conform to the state religion.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
In speaking, as he did, against this
measure, Walpole was battling for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">[676]</a></span>
the religious liberty of Catholics as
well as of other dissenters from the
Anglican communion, and was doing
all that lay in his power to promote
education among them.</p>

<p>His associate in and out of office,
General, afterward Earl, Stanhope,
who also became premier in his
turn, was a man of most honorable
feelings and enlarged views. During
his tenure of power he not merely
endeavored to repeal the Schism Bill,
the Test Act, and the Bill against Occasional
Conformity, but he had designs
of a higher order. Though Catholics
had favored the Scottish insurrection
in 1715, though Protestant antipathy
to them was at its height,
though the popes and the Catholic
courts of Europe in general supported
the designs of the Stuarts, though
"Papists" were proscribed by common
consent, and even the genius
and <em>very</em> moderate Catholicism of
Pope could scarce save him from
opprobrium on account of his religion,
Lord Stanhope, to his immortal
honor, undertook the cause of the
persecuted remnant, and formed the
design of repealing, or at least greatly
mitigating, the penal laws in force
against them. A paper which he
wrote on the subject was placed in
the hands of leading English Catholics.
The Duke of Norfolk and
Lord Waldegrave were disposed to
accept the conditions, provided they
obtained the sanction of the pope.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
But a variety of causes prevented the
scheme from being carried into effect;
and premature death carried off the
only man who would, at that period,
have had the least chance of success
in a matter so difficult, unpopular,
and benevolent. Lord Stanhope's
offer of indulgence to Catholics, on
condition only of their swearing allegiance
to the reigning family, was an
admirable precedent, and his descendant,
the historian of England from
the Peace of Utrecht to 1783, calls it,
very properly, the earliest germ of
Roman Catholic emancipation.</p>

<p>The Earl of Sunderland also, who
was premier in 1718, concurred with
Stanhope in his schemes for religious
liberty, though he was not equally
sanguine in his hopes. He believed
that any attempt to get rid of the
Test Act&mdash;in other words, to admit
dissenters and Catholics to places
under government&mdash;would be ruinous
to all their liberal designs. He
therefore prevailed on Stanhope to
abate some of his demands, and a bill
for the relief of non-conformists was
carried by the ministry through both
houses, after several important clauses
had been struck out. Sir Robert
Walpole unfortunately opposed the
bill which, on a former occasion, he
had supported in principle. Though
a great man, a sound statesman, a
true patriot, he had his littlenesses.
He did not rise above his age. He
was one thing in office, and another
out of office. He had a passion for
governing, and was not over-scrupulous
in the means he took for attaining
power. Expediency was often
his law, and principle was set aside.
Hence, when Sunderland and Stanhope
were dead, and he once more
took the helm of the ship of state, he
laid a heavy tax on the estates of Catholics,
on the ground of their having
cost the nation so much by fomenting
the rebellion of 1715.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
The disaffection
they then manifested was the
cause also why, in 1716, they were
forbidden, under pain of punishment,
to enlist in the king's service.</p>

<p>But these enactments were of a
temporary nature, called forth by a
special circumstance, and not of sufficient
moment to disprove the assertion
that, under the prime ministers
of George I., the political and social
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">[677]</a></span>
condition of English Catholics was
rendered more hopeful. Yet in saying
this we do not forget that the
statute-book remained unpurged,<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
and exhibited even some additional
defilement. But it is not always by
law-books that we can judge of a nation's
condition. Its acts are often
better than its laws, and it mends its
ways long before it improves its statutes.
It was so for a long period
with Great Britain as regards her
dealings with Catholics, and if it had
been otherwise, scarcely a remnant
of the chosen people would have remained
to bear witness to the ancient
faith. Sir Robert Walpole inclined
in his heart to lenient measures, and
would have done more to promote
religious liberty if he had not fallen
among a stiff-necked generation, to
whom retaliation and oppression
came as things of course. His efforts
to relieve the Quakers from
prosecution and imprisonment for refusing
to pay tithes and church rates,
and to substitute for these a levy by
distress on their goods, sufficiently
proves his aversion to the oppressive
policy which Gibson, the Bishop
of London, and many of his lawn-sleeved
brethren, wished to pursue.</p>

<p>Little alteration took place in the
condition of Catholics during the
premierships of Carteret, Pelham, and
Newcastle. They were few in number,
except in the southern and western
provinces of Ireland, where they
comprised the great body of the laboring
classes. In England, on the
contrary, they had scarcely any hold
on the lower orders, but numbered
among their people many peers,
country gentlemen, and other educated
persons. The alarm they occasioned
was incredible, considering the
poverty of their chapels, and the
scanty numbers by whom these were
frequented. The most wicked and
absurd doctrines were ascribed to
them, nor was any falsehood respecting
them too glaring to obtain
credit with the prejudiced multitude.
The rising of 1745 brought them
more than ever into disrepute, and
their enemies saw with fierce joy their
bones whitening on Temple Bar and
Tower Hill. The butchery of the
Duke of Cumberland was accounted
lenient when exercised against Catholics;
and if the government had
drenched the scaffolds with more
blood of Highland chiefs, it would
probably have been applauded by a
crowd of Protestant zealots. But
Pelham and his brother, the Duke of
Newcastle, were neither cruel nor fanatical;
and the effort made by the
former to ameliorate the condition of
the Jews, though frustrated by the intolerance
of the times, proved that
his leanings, at least, were in favor
of religious and political equality.
Deserted as he was in this matter by
his timid and shuffling brother, hooted
at and cried down as an enemy of
Christianity because he was averse to
persecuting the forlorn and helpless
Jews, we may judge how hopeless
would have been any attempt to
plead the rights of Catholics, and
how prudence itself demanded that
the redress of their wrongs should be
postponed to a more convenient season.
The Whigs of George II.'s
reign did what they could in their
favor, and it was little indeed, by
paving the way for future concessions.</p>

<p>While Chatham, with his fiery genius,
was holding the reins of government,
in concert successively with
the dukes of Devonshire, of Newcastle,
and of Grafton; while Bute
enjoyed the favor of his sovereign,
and incurred in an equal degree the
odium of the people; while Grenville
goaded the American colonists into
revolt, and Rockingham vainly endeavored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">[678]</a></span>
to heal the wounds which
his predecessor had inflicted on them;
little was thought, and still less was
said, in parliament about the emancipation
of Catholics. Yet many
of the events which occurred, many
of the political gladiators who acquired
for themselves such renown in
the arena of public life, were preparing
the way for this happy consummation
in the fulness of time. Every blow
that was struck for freedom was
a gain to the Catholic cause; every
check that was put on the arbitrary
power of the king or the parliament
was in effect a loosening of their
bonds. When Chatham declaimed
against the use of general warrants,
and Wilkes waged war single-handed
with the crown, the cabinet, and
the commons; when Burke and Rockingham,
no less than Chatham, denounced
the injustice of the Stamp
Act, and the fratricidal cruelty of the
war by which it was in principle to
be enforced, the arguments by which
they clove down menaces, boasts,
and blatant sophistry availed more
or less against every thing that could
be pleaded in support of the bondage
and degradation to which Catholics
were subjected. Edmund
Burke was the burning and shining
light of the Rockingham administration.
It was scarcely possible for
the premier to overrate his importance
as an ally. He had the most
philosophical mind of any statesman
of his age; and the fact of his being
chattered against as a wild Irishman
and a concealed papist by the Duke
of Newcastle, proved that the despised
and the detested Catholics of
Ireland were likely to find a friend
in him. He was more than a great
man; he represented a principle.
He never shifted his ground, though
he sometimes changed his front. He
always pleaded for order, and "a
manly, moral, regulated liberty." In
the outset of his political career, the
tide of human thought was setting
in new directions. America was
declaring her independence; the
<i>Wealth of Nations</i> was laying the
foundation of political economy;
Wesley and Whitefield were stirring
up a dormant spirit of sincere though
misguided religion in mines, factories,
fields, and wolds; Hargreaves's spinning-jenny
was well at work; Arkwright's
patent had been issued some
years; Crompton's mule was seen
coming into play; Brindley's canal
from the Trent to the Mersey was
being cut; and Watt was preparing
his third model of the steam-engine.
Powerful solvents of old systems were
applied, and active germs of new
ones sprang up on every side. It
was a time, therefore, when thoughtful
men were accessible to new ideas,
when they would listen to arguments
so new, so strange, so extravagant,
(for such they had once thought
them,) as those which Burke advanced
in favor of religious toleration,
and of the persecuted Irish. Year
after year his convictions gathered
strength, till at last "the god within
him" burst forth, and he denounced
the penal code of Protestant England
as "A system full of coherence
and consistency; well digested and well
composed in all its parts, a machine
of wise and elaborate contrivance,
and as well fitted for the oppression,
impoverishment, and degradation of a
people, and the debasement in them
of human nature itself, as ever proceeded
from the perverted ingenuity
of man."<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
As the secretary, the
friend, the adviser and colleague of
Lord Rockingham, Edmund Burke
had some influence in abating the
rigor of enactments against "papists;"
and though the Rev. James
Talbot, brother of the Earl of Shrewsbury,
was tried for his life at the Old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">[679]</a></span>
Bailey for saying mass, so late as the
year 1769, yet the spirit of persecution
sensibly declined after the fifth
year of George III.'s reign. It was
rarely, and at long intervals, that it
ventured to display itself in the English
parliament; and in 1774, the
first decided step toward toleration
was taken by that prejudiced body.
The Catholics of Canada were allowed
by law to enjoy free exercise of their
religion, subject to the king's
supremacy.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>Only four years passed before this
concession was followed by another
of far greater importance and extent.</p>

<p>It was under the ministry of Lord
North, and with his concurrence,
that Sir George Savile, in 1788, introduced
a bill to repeal the atrocious
enactments extorted from William of
Orange by a relentless parliament.
The bigots of his day had often repeated
the false reports of Jacobites,
who affirmed that William was in
secret a favorer of their religion;
but now that eighty years had rolled
by, the representatives of the nation
in parliament, though not the people
themselves, were sensible of the
injustice their forefathers had wrought,
and were willing to make reparation
for it. It was already a marvellous
change that had come over the
minds of the thinking part of the nation;
and it is pleasing to reflect
that Sir George Savile's healing measure
encountered little opposition.
The penal statutes which his bill repealed
had not, generally speaking,
been put into execution, but in some
instances they had; and Sir George
declared himself cognizant of cases in
which Catholics were not merely living
in terror, but were obliged to bribe
informers not to betray them, in consequence
of the powers which the
law conferred. Thurlow, the attorney-general,
supported the bill, and
so did Dundas, the lord-advocate
of Scotland. The only whisper of
opposition came from a Whig bishop
of Peterborough, named Hinchcliffe.
By this repeal the priests were secured
from persecution, schoolmasters
were permitted to teach, Catholics
were enabled to purchase and to inherit
estates, and many other happy
exemptions from pain and penalty
were granted to them.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
Horace Walpole,
in one of his letters,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
called the
repeal "the restoration of popery,"
and "expected soon to see Capuchins
trampling about, and Jesuits in
high places."</p>

<p>It is needless to recount the excesses
which followed this measure.
The Lord George Gordon riots are
too well known even here to require
more than an allusion to be made to
them. Gibbon, the historian, was
an eye-witness of the scene, and he
says, in memorable words, that "the
month of June, 1780, will ever be
marked by a dark and diabolical
fanaticism, which I supposed to be
extinct, but which actually subsists
in Great Britain <i>perhaps beyond any
other country in Europe</i>." Impelled
by these frantic disturbances, the
parliament condescended to explain
Sir George Savile's bill to the people,
and to show that, though intended to
relieve "papists," it was not meant
to encourage "popery."</p>

<p>The coalition ministry, under the
Duke of Portland, did not last long
enough for Fox, its most distinguished
and philanthropic member, to propose
measures for the relief of Catholics.
But his great rival, Pitt, during
his long tenure of office, had means
of befriending them which he did not
altogether neglect. The Toleration
Act<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
received the royal assent in
1791, and many of its provisions did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">[680]</a></span>
credit to William Pitt's wisdom and
humanity. It removed penalties still
attached by law to the celebration of
Catholic worship, and relieved tutors,
schoolmasters, barristers, and peers
from some degrading restrictions.
Pitt would willingly have gone further,
much further. He would gladly
have fulfilled the promises made to
some of the leaders of the Irish people,
and would have cemented the
union of England and Ireland by admitting
Catholics to a share of political
power and by providing a state
endowment of the Catholic priesthood.
He even resigned his post as
premier in 1801 because he found it
impossible to obtain the consent of
the purblind, bigoted old king to the
measures he had planned for the
peace of Ireland. It would have
been better for his fame if he had
persevered in his good intentions.
That he did not do so, is a stain on
his memory which posterity, however
lenient, cannot wash out. His honor
was involved in completing the union
with Ireland by Catholic emancipation.
This he not only failed to do,
but, out of regard to his sovereign, he
promised in writing that he would
never again moot the question, and
that he would oppose its being agitated
to the day of his death. This
was carrying loyalty too far. It prevailed
against justice. It cancelled
personal honor. An engagement is
sacred; and if Pitt had observed his,
he would have stood higher in the
esteem of thinking men, without driving
George III. into lunacy or to
Hanover. Considering all the circumstances,
we cannot feel surprised
at his setting it aside; but we regret
that he did not hold to it firmly.
Faith in political leaders would then
have been more easy, and public virtue
less a sham. When the strength
of Pitt superseded the weakness of
Addington, and the great statesman
found himself again prime minister,
his tongue was tied in reference to
Catholic claims. Nay, even his rival,
Fox, when he came once more into
office, refrained from advocating
emancipation out of deference to
the king's weakness and tendency
to madness. Indeed, the Grenville
ministry, called usually "All the Talents,"
broke up at last on the question
of removing Catholic disabilities,
as that of Pitt had done in the year
1801. A puny and pitiable concession
had been made to Irish Catholic
soldiers in 1793. They had been
allowed by law to rise in the army to
the rank of colonel, in case of their
serving <em>in Ireland</em>. Lord Sidmouth
and Chancellor Erskine were opposed
to Catholic emancipation, yet even
they were willing in their boundless
generosity to extend this privilege to
officers serving in England. The
king was alarmed at the proposal,
and wrote to Lord Spenser, declaring
that it should never gain his consent.
It would remove a restriction on Roman
Catholics, and it was only part
of a system to which he was unchangeably
averse. But when two
days had passed, his majesty thought
better of it. He would not thwart
his ministers for such a trifle. He
yielded the point, and then discovered
than he had been deceived by the
liberal members of the cabinet, and
that they actually intended to put
Catholics and dissenters on exactly
the same footing as members of the
Anglican church in the army, and to
exact from them merely an oath of
allegiance. The bill for the purpose
had, in fact, been submitted to him,
but, being blind, he had let it pass
without proper scrutiny. His ministers
always affirmed that, if he had
been misled, it was not through their
fault or intention. The afflicted old
man was greatly disturbed by what
he heard on the subject from Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">[681]</a></span>
Sidmouth, and he became still more
indignant when the bill was fathered
on him, introduced into parliament
by Lord Howick, (afterward Lord
Grey,) opposed stoutly by Mr. Perceval,
and read for the first time.
He resolved in secret to rid himself
of ministers whom he regarded as
dangerous and false. He informed
them that the bill in question would
never be signed by him, that it must
be withdrawn, and that he should be
satisfied with nothing less than an explicit
assurance and promise that no
such measures in future should be
proposed. This "All the Talents"
refused to give, and the king, on hearing
that their answer was final, said,
"Then I must look about me."<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>Though the Duke of Portland became
prime minister in 1807 with the
express intention of defending the
sovereign against importunity in favor
of Catholics, it is worthy of remark
that the College of Maynooth was
endowed during his premiership; and
this is only one illustration of the remarkable
fact which we are endeavoring
to exhibit&mdash;that the Catholic
cause in England has progressed in
England under every government
since the revolution of 1688, in spite
of penal statutes, obstacles, and resistance
of king, lords, commons or
people.</p>

<p>Mr. Perceval, who succeeded the
Duke of Portland in 1809, is described
by Madden as "a stupid lawyer,
without character or practice, noted
only for his bigotry."</p>

<p>There was little done for Catholics
in his time; but about two months
after he had been shot in the lobby
of the House of Commons, Lord Wellesley
moved that the Catholic claims
should be considered.</p>

<p>The cabinet of Lord Liverpool
was formed on the basis of neutrality
as regards the Catholic question; in
other words, its members were allowed
to advocate or oppose emancipation,
just as they thought fit. Canning
and Castlereagh were its friends;
Lord Eldon was its bitterest opponent.
The premier himself invariably
spoke against it, but he was not virulent.
His hostility to it arose from
the conviction that Protestant ascendency
was the real and proper basis
of the British constitution, as revised
under William III. To alter that
basis was, in his eyes, to effect a revolution;
and he predicted, in 1812
and in 1825, that if emancipation
were granted, either the Protestant
church in Ireland would be disestablished
or the Roman Catholic Church
there would be established by law.
Events have proved, happily, that he
was not altogether wrong.</p>

<p>The period of the Liverpool administration
was, of course, a dreary
one for Catholics. The efforts of
Grattan, Wellesley, Sir Henry Parnell,
Plunkett, and Canning to obtain
for them some redress, ended for the
most part in cruel disappointment.
Yet in 1817 the government introduced
a bill, which passed both
houses, opening to them the army
and navy, and thus generously bestowed
on them the privilege of shedding
their blood in the service of
their oppressors. By annual acts of
indemnity, also, Catholic officers
were relieved from the penalty of not
taking the oaths of supremacy.</p>

<p>In 1824, Lord Liverpool had so far
relaxed his opposition to Catholic
claims that he spoke in favor of Lord
Lansdowne's two bills for giving the
elective franchise to English as it had
been given to Irish Catholics, and for
throwing open to them magistracies
and other inferior offices, besides allowing
the Duke of Norfolk to execute
his hereditary office of earl marshal.
The bills were rejected, but
the duke's claim was allowed. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">[682]</a></span>
1826, just two years before his death,
Lord Liverpool submitted to the king
an important paper, in which he reminded
his majesty that the cabinet
he had framed in 1812 regarded
emancipation from the first as
an open question, and declared that
he could not now be a party to any
other arrangement. He humbly suggested
that the king should advert to
the actual state of the opinions of
public men in the two houses of parliament,
particularly of those in the
House of Commons, upon the Roman
Catholic question, and that he should
seriously consider whether it would
not be at least as impracticable as in
1812 to form an administration upon
the exclusively Protestant principle.
Thus Lord Liverpool himself, and his
neutral or divided cabinet, prepared
the way for emancipation in the year
after his death.</p>

<p>Canning succeeded Lord Liverpool
in 1827. He had long advocated
the redress of Catholic wrongs. It
was not his fault that Ireland was
duped by the union. It had been
his desire and intention that emancipation
should seal and complete that
measure. He could scarcely venture
to speak of it, however, except in
vague terms; for the smallest allusion
to it on his part would have been
sure to call down upon him the vengeance
of the treasury benches. Yet he
did allude to it in January and April,
1799, and thirteen years after, when,
speaking of the Catholic claims, he
declared that "expectations had been
held out, the disappointment of
which involved the moral guilt of an
absolute breach of faith."</p>

<p>"Does history," asks Goldwin
Smith, in discussing the wrongs of
Ireland&mdash;"does history afford a parallel
to that agony of seven centuries
which has not yet reached its close?
But England is the favorite of Heaven;
and when <em>she</em> commits oppression,
it will not recoil on the oppressor!"</p>

<p>If Canning's life had been spared,
there is no doubt that he would have
signalized his tenure of office by the
completion, in some measure at least,
of the designs of the Catholic Association.
This body, formed by
O'Connell in 1823, had infused new
life and hope into Irish patriotism.
Disappointed and betrayed as the
people of Ireland had been by one
statesman after another, they could
not but expect something from Canning's
hands, especially when they
saw him rise in April, 1822, and move
for leave to bring in a bill which
should relieve Roman Catholic peers
from the disabilities imposed on them
by the Act 30 of Charles II., with regard
to the right of sitting and voting
in the House of Peers. His brilliant
and beautiful speech was crowned
with a certain success. His motion
was carried by a majority of five; but
Peel opposed the measure, and the
Lords rejected it by a majority of
forty-two. Their policy in such matters
has always been one of obstruction.
They declined to let noblemen
so noble and so pacific, and of families
so ancient, as the Dukes of Norfolk,
the Earl of Shrewsbury, Lord
Petre, and Lord Stourton, sit beside
them in their chambers as peers of
the realm.</p>

<p>After this failure, Canning's zeal in
the Catholic cause is said to have declined;
but he doubtless felt his impotence,
and waited only till a more
favorable opportunity of serving the
Catholic interests should arrive.</p>

<h2>CHESS.</h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>It is rather difficult for the spectator
at a game of chess (who is not
himself a player) to comprehend the
pleasure of it, and to believe that
those two grave, silent individuals are
not only seeking but actually finding
amusement and recreation.</p>

<p>Yet no game is more beautiful in
its appointments; beautiful in the
mathematical precision of its moves;
beautiful in its colored, carved, and
varied pieces; intellectually beautiful
in its very quietude&mdash;in the power
with which it represses every manifestation
of hope or disappointment,
in its wordless intensity of thought.</p>

<p>Other games come in some degree
within the scope of the most humble
capacity; but chess, royal chess,
loftier in its requirements, demands
the most noble. It has attractions
all-absorbing and fascinating as well
as profitable unto wisdom; but they
stand fully revealed to him only who
can widely plan and steadily execute;
whose circumspection is never beguiled
and whose caution never sleepeth;
who is elated not overmuch by success
nor despondent under disasters;
who keepeth his own counsel and
can baffle an opponent's penetration;
whose well-schooled eye gives no
clue, by a glance, to his intended victim,
and whose well-trained finger
never hovers in irresolution. Behold
the requirements of chess!</p>

<p>It has been justly called in olden
English <i>The Royalle Game</i>; for not
only is a king its hero, but it has afforded
amusement to kings and warriors
through many a past age, and
in countries widely distant from each
other.</p>

<p>The origin of the game of chess is
still an unsettled question. Like some
of the oriental monarchs, it might
write itself "brother to the sun and
moon"&mdash;so ancient is its pedigree.
Some writers have proved, to their
own satisfaction at least, that it was
chess which enlivened the tedium of
the Greeks encamped about the walls
of Troy, and that its inventor was
Palamedes, son of Nauplius, King of
Eub&oelig;a. Who can doubt the inventive
genius of Palamedes after all the
tales told of him?&mdash;tales we learn once
and then forget. I repeat one. When
the Greek heroes were gathering for
the mighty Trojan conflict, Palamedes,
himself a warrior, was sent to Ithaca,
to summon Achilles and Odysseus to
join them. The latter, desirous of
evading the call, feigned himself insane,
and Palamedes, to test his truthfulness,
seized his infant child and laid
it before him in a furrow which he was
ploughing. Odysseus paused, raised
the child, and removed it, thus giving
evidence of his sanity. Who after
this can doubt the inventive powers
of Palamedes or his historian, and
who can say that either might not
have invented chess?</p>

<p>In a manuscript of the fourteenth
century in the Harleian collection, in
the British Museum, is a drawing in
which two warriors are represented,
evidently Greeks, with a chess-board
between them, engaged in play. The
author of the <span class="smcap">MS.</span> traces the game
back to Odysseus, and concludes that
one of these chiefs is intended for him.</p>

<p>In the great Egyptian collection of
the British Museum, specimens are
preserved of a kind of chess-men taken
from a tomb of one of the Pharaohs,
which prove that they had a game<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">[684]</a></span>
similar if not identical with our chess;
and some hieroglyphics on the ruins
of Luxor, Thebes, and Palmyra have
been interpreted as indicating such a
game.</p>

<p>Caxton, who printed a <i>Boke of
Chesse</i> in 1474, quoting from some
other writers, gives a wonderful story,
showing that it was devised in the
reign of Evil-Merodach, King of Babylon,
by a philosopher "whyche
was named in Caldee Exerses, and
in Greke Philemetor." The Greek
cognomen of the philosopher leads
somewhat to the belief of such a possibility.</p>

<p>Chaucer, without any proof, gives
us in rhyme another candidate for
the glory&mdash;Athalus. He describes,
in a sort of dream, a visionary opponent,
Fortune&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>A repetition of half the assertions
and conjectures on this subject would
fill volumes; indeed, volumes have
been written on it; for no other thing
of pure amusement has ever enlisted
in its cause so many learned commentators
of all tongues and nations, who
unite, however, upon two points&mdash;its
remote antiquity and its mighty renown.</p>

<p>The most reliable account of the
origin of the game is, without doubt,
that given by Sir William Jones. His
high official rank for many years under
the English government in India,
and his familiarity with oriental languages,
gave him opportunities for
oriental research beyond almost any
other writer. He asserts, as the result
of his inquiries, that it was invented
by the Hindoos, and from
them (according to a universal Persian
tradition) it was brought, in the
sixth century, to Persia. Its next step
was to Arabia, and from thence it
was carried by the Saracenic conquest
of Spain to western Europe. He
found no mention of it in the classic
writings of the Brahmins, although (he
continues) they say confidently that
Sanscrit books on chess exist.</p>

<p>Who the gifted individual was from
whose brain emanated such an ingenious
complication of mathematics and
strategy, disguised under the mask
of amusement, we shall perhaps never
know. He might well have exclaimed
with Horace,</p>

<p class="center">
"<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Exegi monumentum ære perennius.</span>"<br />
</p>

<p>But alas! the name of the builder
is lost; or perhaps a future Layard, in
exhuming the splendors of some ancient
city, may find a record on some
crumbling stone of the inventor of
chess.</p>

<p>To an indefinite number of persons
the honor is at present ascribed, evidently
in mere conjecture, as in the
following extract translated from a
Chinese annal on chess; but it has
an interest, in showing the antiquity
of the game and the high esteem in
which it was held:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Three hundred and seventy-nine years
after the time of Confucius, or 1965 years
ago," says the annal, "Hung Cochu, King
of Kiangnan, sent an expedition into the
Shense country, under command of a mandarin
named Hansing, to conquer it. After
one campaign, the soldiers went into winter
quarters, and they grew homesick and wanted
to return. Then Hansing invented the
game of chess. They were well pleased.
In the spring they took the field again, and
soon added the rich country of Shense to
the kingdom of Kiangnan."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is more likely that Hansing only
taught the soldiers what he had himself
learned elsewhere; but Shense is
still the name of a northern province
of China, and Chinese soldiers still
play chess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685">[685]</a></span></p>

<p>For the name of the game also, as
well as its origin, we rely most on Sir
W. Jones, who traced it to <i>Chaturlinga</i>,
signifying in eastern dialect certain
parts of an army; and in his
time the Malays still called it <i>Chatur</i>.</p>

<p>The whole vocabulary of chess&mdash;the
only sound which breaks the monotonous
silence of the game, is the
little word <em>check</em>; and it is a singular
fact, remarked by Mr. F. W. Cronhelm,
that, however varied the names
of the pieces in different languages,
yet the Italians, French, English,
Danes, Icelanders, Germans, Poles,
and Russians all give the king warning
in the same word&mdash;<em>check!</em> Somebody
traces it to <em>sheik</em>, the title of a
high ruler in the Arabian dynasty, and
supposes that they so named the principal
piece, which we call <em>king</em>; hence
when the adversary placed him in
danger, he called out to him "sheik!"
or, as we say, "check!" This is certainly
plausible; for <em>mat</em> in Arabic,
as also in some dialects of Persia and
India, signifies <em>to kill</em>, <em>to slay</em>; hence
comes "<em>sheik-mat</em>," king-slain, or the
modern "<em>check-mate</em>."</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>It may be supposed, then, following
the dates of Sir W. Jones, that the
game of chess made its entrance into
Arabia in her most glorious era; and
it is easy to believe that a recreation
so purely intellectual, so entirely reliant
on skill and removed from chance,
and which called into action all the
higher powers of mind, would speedily
find favor with the refined and cultivated
Arabians in the golden days
of her history. It is easy to picture
Haroun-al-Raschid, who "never built
a mosque without attaching to it a
school," and who taught his subjects
that "the most noble homage of a
creature is to cultivate the faculties
bestowed on him by his Creator"&mdash;it
is easy to imagine him seeking relaxation
from the cares of government
in a game of chess; and not he alone&mdash;but
that, from the universal diffusion
of learning and refinement among
the people, under him and his immediate
successors, it would meet universal
acceptance, and be engrafted,
as it were, on their nationality. And
thus we find it was; and so entirely
adopted that it was the most cherished
pleasure which they carried
with them to (what was to them) the
<em>far-off</em> land of Spain.</p>

<p>To the Arabians then, the west of
Europe, at least, if not the whole of
it, is indebted for chess; and it is
pleasant to believe that its present
perfections may have been wrought
out by some modifications of it, in
those famous old universities and
schools of learning which history tells
us were scattered over every land
where the Arabians held sway, but
more especially over Arabia proper.</p>

<p>Chess, looked upon in this connection,
wears a mantle of romance;
there is a spell upon it of that departed
glory! It is redolent of orange-groves,
and jasmines, and thickets of
roses; of sculptured halls, and gorgeous
tapestry, and marble pavements;
of learned men and beautiful
women. All around it in that land
breathed an impassioned poetry and
an enchaining eloquence; the language
of passion, and inspired thoughts, and
bold imagery, of whose power to sway
mankind our rule-bound brains can
form no conception.</p>

<p>It speaks to us of the days when
Bagdad was the gathering-place,
under Al-Mamoun, (Mahomet-aben-Amer,)
of the wise men of all nations;
when her universities and schools of
science were the boast of her rulers;
when long trains of camels were daily
seen entering her gates laden with
precious manuscripts for her libraries;
when medicine, law, mathematics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">[686]</a></span>
astronomy, counted among her citizens
their most renowned professors,
and when all these sciences were
made accessible to the people by colleges
and academies in every town.
Nor were Bassora, Kaffa, Samarcand,
and numerous other cities much less
famous; Alexandria possessed more
than twenty schools for philosophy
alone; and Fez and Larace held in
their immense libraries works of rare
value nowhere else to be found. In
every department of science and art
they seem to have labored with success.
They had dictionaries, geographical,
critical, and biographical; the
universal history of the world by
Aboul-Feda, and the great historical
dictionary of Prince Abdel Malek.
Al-Assacher wrote commentaries on
the first inventors of the arts; and
Al-Gazel, a learned work on Arabian
antiquities. Nor were their researches
confined to the schools; after forty
years of travel in studying mineralogy,
Abou-ryan-al-Byrony produced his
treatise on precious stones&mdash;rich in
facts and observations. With equal
zeal, at a later period, Aben-al-Beither
traversed the mountains and plains
of Europe, the sands of Africa, and
the most remote countries of Asia, to
gather every thing rare and worthy of
record in the vegetable and animal
world. Chemistry they applied to
the arts of life; and Al-Farabi, who
spoke seventy languages, spent his
life in making a compend of all known
sciences in one immense encyclopædia.</p>

<p>They had invented gunpowder although
the honor is often falsely given
to a German chemist&mdash;and they were
familiar with the compass, long before
either was named in Europe; and
our sciences of calculation are indebted
to them for numerals. The mass
of their poetry and fiction exceeds
that of all other nations put together.
One, at least, we all know; for who
cannot recall many&mdash;yes, how <em>many</em>
happy hours of boyhood, beguiled
with the gorgeous impossibilities of
<i>Arabian Nights</i>?</p>

<p>Amidst all these royal students,
these accomplished scholars, the chess-board
had its place; it was the pleasure,
the recreation&mdash;the field whereon
wit encountered wit in sharp and
pleasant tilt. And while from all that
land the light of science has departed;
while the glories of the past are,
with the mass of its people, not even
a tradition, travellers tell us that, after
the day's journeying is done, the
dusky Arab "spreads out on the
ground a checkered cloth, and plays
on it a game similar to our chess."</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Although Spain, and the adjacent
nations through her, received chess
from Arabia, the game not only existed
but was wide-spread in the north
of Europe at a period so early (and
under a slight modification) that we
are led to believe they derived it from
some other source. Indeed, nothing
would seem more likely than that
some of the many tribes who were
constantly migrating thither from Asia
would carry it with them. Major C.
F. de Jaenish, a Russian writer, is of
opinion that Russia received it direct
from the east through her ancient
conquerors, the Moguls; and in proof
of this, he notes two pieces changed
in the chess of southern Europe, but
retained in their original form in Russia.
These are, first, the commander
of the army, or <i>biser</i>, called in Persia
<i>ferz</i>; and second, the <i>elephant</i>, called
in Russia, <i>Slone</i>. But it doubtless
existed in Russia long before the Moguls
held sway, which was not until
the thirteenth century; and long before
that time there are records of it
as an amusement among the Northmen
of the neighboring kingdoms.
Besides this, in the ninth century the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">[687]</a></span>
descendants of Ruric the Norman,
who then ruled Russia, had extended
their conquests to the Black Sea, and,
in the language of the old historian,
"greatly infested its waters;" one
of them had even married the sister
of the Greek emperor. It is, therefore,
more than probable that through
some of these channels chess was
introduced into the northern part of
Europe at a very early date.</p>

<p>It may have been carried thither
by those maritime marauders, called
the sea-kings, even before it was heard
of in Spain. The first movement of
the Arabians against Spain is generally
fixed in the year seven hundred
and ten; when Taric-ben-Zeyed, with
some galleys disguised as merchantmen,
cruised along the coasts of Andalusia
and Lusitania, to see what temptation
the Christian land offered to
the followers of the prophet. That
his survey was satisfactory, we know
by what followed. But long before
this, the Northmen in their ships had
made themselves famous and feared.
An Icelandic chronicle tells us "they
were on every sea, and more numerous
on water than on land." In the
eighth and ninth centuries, they were
to be found not only repeatedly ravaging
England, Scotland, and Ireland,
but sailing up the Somme, the
Seine, the Loire, the Garonne, and the
Rhone; they had pillaged and burnt
Paris, Amiens, Orleans, Bordeaux,
Toulouse, Nantes, and Tours; and
laid waste Provence and Dauphiny.
More than once they landed in Spain;
and they had coasted the Mediterranean,
to the terror of Greece and Italy.
These expeditions were always predatory;
and they may not only have
acquired in their Mediterranean voyages
some hints of the game of chess,
but chess-men and chess-boards may
have made a trifle in the booty with
which they always returned laden to
their northern homes.</p>

<p>Mons. Mallet, the antiquarian, in
seeking to account for the great quantity
of foreign coin found about that
time in the northern kingdoms, thinks
it less probable that it was the honest
gains of commerce than "relics of
the plunder collected by these ravagers."
In like manner, perhaps, they
appropriated chess. In whatever way
obtained, it must have been to them
particularly attractive; for what was
it but that for which they lived&mdash;battle
and victory? Nothing could have
been better adapted, in the long
nights of their northern winters, both
to divert them from that restlessness
which seems to have possessed the
whole of their existence not spent in
the tumults of war and the chase, or
in preparations for them&mdash;and also as
a pastime at their frequent and magnificent
feasts; occasions upon which
they infused into it their own fierce
and vindictive spirit, for we know
that their chess games ended very
frequently not in the check-mate of
the king, but in breaking each other's
heads with the chess-board. Some
such instances on record are tragic
and revolting. Similar manners extended
along the middle ages. An
old writer thus explains the feud
which existed between Charlemagne
and Ogier the Dane:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"At one of the festivals at the court of
Charlemagne, the emperor's son Charles,
and Bauduin, son of Ogier, went to play together.
They took a chess-board and sat
down to play for pastime. They arranged
their chess-men on the board. The emperor's
son first moved his pawn, and young
Bauduin moved his <i>aufin</i>, (bishop.) Then
Charles thought to press him very hard, and
he moves his knight upon the other <i>aufin</i>.
The one moves forward and the other backward
so long that Bauduin said <em>mate</em> to him
in the corner. Then the young prince was
furious at his defeat, and not only assailed
the son of Ogier with the most insulting
language, but seized the chess-board and
dealt him such a violent blow on his forehead
that he split his head and scattered his
brains on the floor!"</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">[688]</a></span></p>

<p>King John of England, in his youth,
at the court of his father Henry II.,
played sometimes with Fulk Fitz Warine,
a lad like himself, and as often
it ended in a quarrel. A curious old
history of the Fitz Warines gives the
following story:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Young Fulk was bred at the court of
King Henry, and was much beloved by all
his sons except John; for he used often to
quarrel with John. It happened that John
and Fulk were sitting all alone in a chamber
playing at chess. John took the chess-board
and hit Fulk a great blow. Fulk felt hurt,
raised his foot and struck John so that his
head went against the wall, and he grew
weak and faint. Fulk was in consternation,
but he was glad they were alone. Then
he rubbed John's ears, and he recovered
and went to the king his father to complain."</p></blockquote>

<p>His majesty bestowed upon him
little sympathy, for he punished him
for being quarrelsome. Considering
that John began the affray, this might
pass for justice; but he did not forget
the matter when he came to the
throne. Fulk was the famous outlaw.</p>

<p>In many old manuscripts incidental
mention is made of chess as a
favorite amusement for heroes. When
Regner Lodbrog, the warrior-poet,
was killed, the messenger who carried
the news to his sons found two of
them&mdash;Sigued (snake-eye) and Hurtish
(the bold)&mdash;playing chess; the
third one, Biorn, was mending his
lance. Regner Lodbrog died about
the close of the eighth century.</p>

<p>Snorro Sturleson relates that, in 1028,
Canute, King of Denmark, rode to
Roskild to visit Earl Ulft, the husband
of his sister. The king was very dull
and scarcely spoke, and to enliven
him, Earl Ulft proposed a game of
chess. So they sat down to it, and
played until Ulft took a knight; this
the king would not allow.</p>

<p>"Are you a coward?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"You did not call me coward when
I shielded you in battle," replied the
earl; but for this reminder he lost
his head.</p>

<p>An early metrical romance tells us
that when Witikind, king of the pagan
Saxons, received information that
Charlemagne was marching on his
dominions, the messenger found him
in his palace at Tremoigne, playing
chess with Escorsaus de Lutise; and
his queen, Sebile, who also understood
the game, was looking on.
Witikind was so indignant at the news
that he "seized the chess-board and
smashed it to pieces, and his face
grew as red as a cherry."</p>

<p>There is a droll story told of a
kindred spirit of more modern date.
A choleric Scottish nobleman, a former
Earl of Stair, frequently played
with a friend of his, Colonel Stewart.
Not contented with bestowing
very expressive invectives on the
colonel's occasional superior play, he
sometimes, when goaded by a <em>check-mate</em>,
flung at his head any object
possible within reach; so at last the
colonel, for prudence' sake, when
about to make his last move, always
rose hastily and retreating behind
some door, called out, "<em>Check-mate</em>,
my lord!"</p>

<p>While the general manners of an
age are gathered from its grave historians,
we can learn them more in detail
from its romances. In all the
early romances left to us, wherever
chess is mentioned&mdash;and it is constantly
introduced as a pastime of
knights, princes, and courtly dames&mdash;it
is almost always an occasion or
implement of some fierce dispute.</p>

<p>In the romance of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quatre fils
d'Aymon</i>, the agents of Regnault go
to arrest Richard, Duke of Normandy,
and find him playing chess. The
result is thus quaintly told in an old
English version, printed by Copeland.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When Duke Richarde saw these sergeauntes
hed him by the arm, he helde in
his hande a lady of ivery, wherewith he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">[689]</a></span>
would have given <em>mate</em> to Younet. Then he
withdrew his arm, and gave to one of the
sergeauntes such a stroke with it into the
forehead that he made him tumble over and
over at his feete; and then he tooke a rooke
and smote another withal upon his head, so
that he all to-brost it to the brayne."</p></blockquote>

<p>In the romance of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Parise la Duchesse</i>,
her young son, brought up at
the court of Hungary, becomes an
object of jealousy to some of the
nobles, and four of them conspire to
murder him. In order to accomplish
their object with safety to themselves,
they invite him to play chess with
them in a retired cellar. "Hughes,"
said they, "will you come with us
to play at chess? For you can teach
us chess and dice; for certainly you
know the games better than we do."
Hughes seemed suspicious of their advances,
and it was not until they promised
him to avoid all disputes that
he accepted their invitation. He began
to play with the son of Duke
Granier; but while he in kindness
was about showing them in what
manner to move, they drew their
knives upon him, and outrageously
insulted him. He killed the foremost
of them with a blow of his fist, and
seizing the chess-board for a weapon,
for he was unarmed, he "<em>brained</em> the
other three with it."</p>

<p>In Spain and Italy, about the same
time, the game is mentioned under
more gentle guise. An interesting
letter is preserved, written by Damianus,
Cardinal Bishop of Ostia, to
Pope Alexander II., who was elected
pope in 1061. Damianus tells the
pope how he was travelling with a
bishop of Florence, when,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"having arrived at a hotel, I withdrew
into the cell of a priest, while he remained
with a crowd of travellers in the spacious
house. In the morning I was informed by
my servant that the bishop had been playing
chess; which information like an arrow
pierced my heart. At a convenient hour I
sent for him, and said, in a tone of reproof,
'The hand is stretched out, the rod is ready
for the offender.' 'Let the fault be proved,'
said he, 'and penance shall not be refused.'
'Was it well,' I rejoined, 'was it worthy
of the character you bear, to spend the evening
in the vanity of chess-play, and defile
the hands and tongue which ought to be the
mediator between man and the Deity? Are
you aware that, by the canonical law, bishops
who are dice-players are ordered to be deposed?'
He, however, making himself a
shield of defence from the difference of
names, said that dice was one thing, and
chess another; consequently, that the canon
only forbade dice, but tacitly allowed chess.
To which I replied, 'Chess is not named in
the text, but the general term of dice comprehends
both games; wherefore, since dice
is forbidden and chess is not named, it follows
without doubt that both are equally
condemned.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>It is safe to conclude from this that
the cardinal himself was not familiar
with the game.</p>

<p>Females are represented on many
illuminated manuscripts, as well as in
early romances, as playing chess together
or with knights. In one called
<i>Blonde of Oxford</i>, Jean, a young
French nobleman, comes to England
and enters the household service of
the Earl of Oxford. It was a part
of Jean's duty to attend on the Lady
Blonde, daughter of the earl, and
serve her at table; after dinner, he
goes hawking and hunting with them,
and also teaches the ladies French.
"Then he entertains the Ladye
Blonde, and teaches her chess, and he
often says <em>check</em> and <em>mate</em> to her."</p>

<p>Similar scenes are in <i>Ipomydon</i>, as
in the following quoted by Strutt:</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When theye had dyned, as you saye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lords and ladys yede to playe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some to tables, some to chesse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And other gamys more or less."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<blockquote>

<p>"The writers immediately after the conquest,"
says a distinguished antiquarian,
"speak of the Saxons as playing at chess;
and pretend that they learned the game of
the Danes. Gaimar, who gives an interesting
story of the deceit practised on King
Edgar (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 973) by Ethelwold, when sent
to visit the beautiful Elfthrida, daughter of
Orgar of Devonshire, describes the young
lady and her noble father passing the day
at chess." (<i>Wright.</i>)</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690">[690]</a></span></p>

<p>Such examples might be multiplied
to tediousness; but one more notice
of it among the Northmen is worth
giving, because it is found in one of
the grandest of modern epics, by the
Swedish poet, Tegner, founded on
events in the life of one of their most
renowned heroes&mdash;<i>The Legend of
Frithiof</i>.</p>

<p>The fortunes of the valiant Frithiof,
who was the son of a thane, seem
to have been ruled by his love for the
fair Ingeborn, daughter of a king,
and the scorn with which her two
brothers spurned his proposal for her
hand. A day of retaliation, however,
soon came. Helgé and Halfdan,
the brothers, were threatened by a
neighboring foe, and sent to Frithiof&mdash;certainly
with a sublime forgetfulness
of what had passed&mdash;to ask his
aid. When the messenger arrived, he
was playing chess with his friend,
Bjorn, the Bear. Frithiof refuses very
decidedly. His heart still pines for
Ingeborn; and, like a true Viking, he
betakes himself for consolation to the
sea, which he vows shall be "his
home in life and his grave in death."
The chess-board beside which Frithiof
doubtless forgot his griefs for a
brief space is described as magnificent&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Beside a chess-board's checkered frame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frithiof and Bjorn pursued their game;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silver was each alternate plane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each alternate plane of gold."<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Perhaps some reader will be glad to
learn that, after a few years, "he is
weary of sea-fights and of hewing
men in twain," and returns home to
marry Ingeborn.</p>

<p>Such was one of the early chess-players.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>It is remarkable in the history of
chess how very trifling the variations
which have ever been made in it.
The lapse of time, which has swept
away cities and their inhabitants,
which has so blotted from human
speech the words of those who once
held converse around it that their inscriptions
on stone are unintelligible,
has left it almost unaltered.</p>

<p>Coming close to that domestic life
of nations of which chess made one
pleasure, what has not changed?
Modes of dress, construction of dwellings,
fashions of entertainment&mdash;all
have had their mutations. Yet the
game, as far back as the earliest accounts
of it, has been almost literally
such as we see it. One feature has
always marked it, <em>chess</em>; there has
always been a sovereign to be attacked
and defended, and inferior pieces
to accomplish these ends in combination,
yet by different means. The
board of sixty-four squares has also
almost invariably been maintained.</p>

<p>Two pieces were modified when it
passed from Arabia to Spain, or rather,
from the Saracen to the Christian.
In Arabia and Persia, there was
no female on the board; what we call
"queen" was, with them, "vizier or
counsellor," and called <i>pherz</i>, <i>ferz</i>, or
<i>fers</i>. This was retained in Europe
until about the eleventh century, when
it was supplanted by our queen. But
wherefore a queen? We shall see.</p>

<p>Several events combined to make
this period the age of poetry and of
a peculiar deference to womankind.
It will be remembered that in the
eleventh century, 1095, was preached
the first Crusade, a thing of romance
and poetry itself. However different
the motives which actuated that crowd
of nobles and warriors who joined in
creating the mighty army whose advance-guard
was led by the monk
Peter, to all appearance each one
was a hero. Country and kingdom,
home and love, happiness of wife or
maiden, was the sacrifice professedly
offered at the shrine of a holy enthusiasm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691">[691]</a></span>
enkindled by faith. Every
earthly interest, every tie of affection,
all consideration of self, was to be accounted
nothing, compared with the
sacred obligations involved in the expedition.</p>

<p>The means of expressing all these
delicate sentiments and deep emotions,
and furthermore of expressing
them in poetry, was happily opened
to them at this era in the language
of the troubadours&mdash;the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Langue d'Oc</i>.
The polish which poetry had received
from the Arabians in Spain had elevated
it to an art, and made it so attractive
to the more refined classes
that the highest born, even kings and
princes, did not think it beneath them
to cultivate it; and he added greatly
to his renown who had qualified himself
to express in it the two ruling passions
of his soul&mdash;his martial ardor
and his devotion to his <i>ladye-love</i>.
Every knight, almost, was a troubadour,
and the homage rendered to
woman seems almost fabulous. A
French writer says of this period:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Love had assumed a new character....
It was not more tender and passionate
than among the Romans; but it was more
respectful, and something of a mystery was
mingled with its sentiment. Women were
considered rather as angelic beings than as
dependents and inferiors. The task of serving
and protecting them was considered honorable,
as though they were the representatives
of the divinity upon earth; and to this
worship was added an ardor of feeling, passion,
and desire, peculiar to the people of the
south, and the expression of which was borrowed
from the Arabians."<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Woman was not slow in extending
her influence to more prosaic matters
than <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Cours d'Amour</i> and the inspirations
of poetry; and history furnishes
an abundance of examples
where female interference was permitted
and female decision respected in
the gravest affairs of life. After Alphonso
VI. of Castile had driven the
Moors from Toledo, he granted to
such of them as chose to return the
use of a cathedral to serve as a
mosque; but, says history, "he soon
broke his promise, and deprived them
of it, at the instigation of and in order
to please his wife."</p>

<p>Who, then, but a woman could have
routed the grand-vizier from the chess-board
and taken his place?</p>

<p>The other piece altered is the bishop,
which of course was not so called
by the orientals. This piece with
the Arabians and Persians was represented
by an elephant, and named
<i>pil</i> or <i>phil</i>. In southern Europe, the
name was modified into <i>alfil</i> and <i>aufin</i>,
and is found so in old writers; but at
a very early period the bishop seems
to have been generally adopted. In
northern Europe, it was not so; the
Russians and Swedes still retain the
elephant. What we now call castle,
and sometimes <i>rook</i>, was also called
by the Saracens <i>roc</i>, and by the Persians
<i>rokh</i>, signifying champion or
foot-soldier, and shaped accordingly.
This form is seen in some ancient
chess-men in the British Museum, supposed
to be of Icelandic manufacture;
the Icelanders called this piece <i>hrokr</i>.
These chess-men, many in number
and carved in ivory&mdash;that is, the tusk
of the walrus&mdash;were found in the year
1831, on the coast of the Isle of Lewes,
and are referred by antiquaries back
to the twelfth century. They are the
remnants of seven or eight distinct
sets, and are therefore supposed to
have belonged to some dealer who
was shipwrecked there. The carving
on them, and the costumes, bear
traces of being Scandinavian. The
<i>king</i> is in a sitting posture, crowned,
and has a sword in his hand, which
he rests crossing his lap; the <i>queen</i>
also is crowned, and holds a drinking-horn,
such as the northern women
used in serving mead and ale to their
guests; one of them represents a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">[692]</a></span>
<i>bishop</i> with mitre and crozier; the
<i>knights</i> are on horseback, and are covered
with armor; and here is the <i>roc</i>
of the Saracens in its original form, a
kind of foot-soldier, in place of the
castle&mdash;which, however, is yet called
<i>rook</i>. The remainder are pawns.
Thus they are nearly identical with
any set of modern chess-men, although
fabricated more than seven
hundred years ago.</p>

<p>The largest king in this collection,
in his sitting posture, is more than four
inches in height and near seven in
circumference. The other pieces are
smaller, but correspond. The chess-board
which accommodated such
pieces must have been a formidable
weapon in a strong hand, and quite
likely to "break heads and scatter
brains."</p>

<p>Many old books are to be found in
public and private libraries which contain
descriptions of chess-men, rules
for playing, etc. In the twelfth century,
such a manual was composed by
some devotee of the game in Latin
verse. A little later, a volume was
written in Latin by Jacques de Cessolas;
it was translated into French
by Jean de Vigny, and entitled <i>Moralization
of Chess</i>. It may be seen
in English in Caxton's <i>Boke of Chesse</i>,
published in London, 1474.</p>

<p>Damiano, a Portuguese, in the fifteenth
century compiled a book of
directions for playing, with examples
of eighty-eight games.</p>

<p>A little volume, very amusing in its
quaint old English, was published in
London in the reign of Elizabeth; it
is dedicated to Lord Robert Dudley,
afterward the celebrated Earl of Leicester.
It is entitled, <i>The Pleasaunt
and Wittie Playe of the Cheasts, reviewed
with Instructions both to Learn
it Easily and to Play it Well</i>. <i>Lately
translated out of Italian into French,
and now set forthe in Englishe by
James Rowbotham.</i></p>

<p>In it, among many other things, the
author describes the chess-men:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As for the fashion of the pieces, that is
according to the fantasie of the workeman,
which maketh them after this manner. Some
make them lyke men, whereof the <i>kynge</i> is
the highest, and the <i>queene</i> (which some
name amasone or ladye) is the next, bothe
two crowned. The <i>bishoppes</i> some name
alphins, some fooles, and some princes,
lyke as also they are next unto the kynge
and queene, other some cal them archers,
and they are fashioned accordinge to the wyll
of the workeman. The <i>knights</i> some cal
horsemen, and they are men on horsebacke.
The <i>rookes</i> some call elephantes, cariynge
towres upon their backes, and men within
the towres. The <i>paunes</i> some cal fote-men,
as they are souldiours on fote, cariynge
some of them pykes, and other some javelyns
and targets. Other makers of cheast-men
make them other fashions, but use thereof
wyll cause perfect knowledge."</p></blockquote>

<p>Such has chess been through times
past; it numbers still among its votaries
the noble and the learned; and
it is advocated by some of them with
an enthusiasm surely never surpassed
in the days long, long gone by in its
oriental home.</p>

<p>It has floated down to us from
those days like a leaf on some broad
stream beneath whose waves mightier
things have sunk.</p>

<h2>THE FIRST &OElig;CUMENICAL COUNCIL OF THE VATICAN.</h2>


<p>The nineteenth century is still adding
to the catalogue of important events,
for which it will be memorable in future
histories. Men still live who looked
on Fulton's first steamboat on the Hudson,
who ventured on the first railway
train, and who smiled incredulously at
the folly of Morse stretching iron wires
on poles along the country between cities
a day's journey apart, and pretending
thus to transmit messages between
them with the velocity of electricity.
The humble river steamboat has developed
into the gigantic ocean steamer,
that heeds not the winds and bids defiance
to the waves. Lines of railway intersect
continents, and cross from ocean
to ocean. Telegraph wires spread their
network over every civilized land, and,
boldly plunging into ocean depths, aim
to girdle the earth. The cotton-gin has
revolutionized the habits of nations and
the commerce of the world, and the
sewing-machine is bringing the change
into every household. This wondrous
increase of travel and commerce among
nations has given birth to international
exhibitions of art and industry as gorgeous
as the visions of the Arabian story-teller.
In the Suez Canal, this century
has succeeded where antiquity
failed; and in the Mont Cenis tunnel,
soon to be finished, it is accomplishing
what past ages never dreamed of attempting.</p>

<p>Science, too, contributes her wonders.
The sun and the stars and the nebulæ
are yielding their secrets; chemistry
boasts of her unexpected conquests;
and the earth is giving forth its pages
of geological lore, fragmentary as yet,
and somewhat confused, ofttimes undecipherable,
often wrongly read by men,
but still presenting to us a kingdom of
knowledge unknown a century ago.</p>

<p>In the political and social sphere this
century has been equally marked. Vast
wars and bloody revolutions ushered it
in. Wars and revolutions have marked
every decade of its progress. Empires
and kingdoms have been thrown down.
Others have been established instead,
and have perished in their turn. The
strong have grown weak, and the weak
have become powerful. And to-day, the
nations of the civilized world feel that
they stand on the thin crust of a volcano,
that trembles under our feet, and
that may at any time burst forth, in other
revolutions and wars, in which arms
of precision, titanic artillery, and iron-clad
vessels shall play a part never yet
witnessed by men.</p>

<p>In the moral and religious world, too,
there is equal excitement and confusion.
Novel principles are proposed, advocated,
and pushed to their extreme and
most violent consequences. Nothing in
government, in morals, or in religion is
left unassailed. There is an incessant
war against God, against truth and virtue,
and against every principle that
would withstand the passions, or the interests,
or the caprices of men. And
the press, which in its wondrous development
has kept full pace with every
other art, is ever busy bringing to every
household, to old and young alike, sometimes
words of truth and goodness, but
a thousand times oftener and more actively
lessons of immorality, discontent,
disorder, and irreligion.</p>

<p>In looking at the world, as it is now,
so rapidly moving on, with its vast energies
and untiring activity, its ever-increasing
commerce, its intense worship
of luxury, its oblivion of principle, its
grasping after wealth, its restlessness
and craving for change for change's sake,
one feels like the traveller who crosses
the Alps by that late feat of modern
engineering, the Mont Cenis Fell Railway.
The wondrous scenery of mountain
and valley charms you. You are
amazed at the boldness which conceived,
and the skill which executed the
work. You rejoice, as you are borne
rapidly on, in the luxuriously-cushioned
seat and well-warmed railway compartment,
over the steep road you remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_694" id="Page_694">[694]</a></span>
well to have travelled, years ago,
so slowly and painfully. But amid all
this pleasure, you cannot shut out the
thought that perhaps the very rumbling
and jarring of the train may set in motion
the vast field of freshly-fallen snow
that lies so lightly on the steep side of
the peak rising above you, on the right
or the left, and bring it down as an irresistible
avalanche, overwhelming road
and train, and casting the shattered cars
and mangled passengers down to the
masses of rock and ice that lie in the
gorge a thousand yards below.</p>

<p>We glory in our rapid advance in
arts, science, and civilization. We feel
ourselves borne rapidly and joyously
forward in a career of progress. But
we cannot shut out entirely a sense of
danger. In many countries, society is
mined by revolutionary combinations,
active and vigilant, watching for any favorable
opportunity, and ever ready to
take advantage of it. In the universal
questioning of every thing and of every
principle, the minds of the masses have
become excited, have lost in great part,
or are fast losing, those fixed and hallowed
principles of justice and truth
which are absolutely necessary for correct
judgment and prudent action. They
are ripe for any plan to be proposed,
even if its only attraction be its novelty.
And they may easily become a mighty
engine of brute, unthinking power, in
the hands of any one bold enough to
seize the control, and skilful enough to
guide them for a time. Might now
makes right. The world is ruled on
the theory of accomplished facts. Peace
itself must stand armed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cap-à-pie</i>. No
one knows into what horrors the death
of one individual might, any month,
throw hundreds of millions of men.</p>

<p>Has all sense of right and justice faded
from the minds of men? Must our
progress be marred by this ever-increasing
danger. Is there no voice to be raised,
no authority to come forth to meet
this emergency of the world?</p>

<p>God gave revelation to mankind,
teaching the world truth and justice,
charity and every virtue, and imparting
to man, in his weakness, strength to
struggle against and overcome his own
passions and the temptations from without.
To his church, the pillar and
ground of truth, Christ committed the
duty of teaching all nations all things
whatsoever he had taught, and promised
to be with her, in the discharge of
this duty, all days even to the consummation
of the world. In its fulfilment
she must meet opposition, trials, scandals,
and difficulties of every sort. But
the gates of hell shall never prevail
against her.</p>

<p>Many a struggle has she gone through,
in the eighteen centuries of her existence;
and incalculable are the benefits
the world owes to her, even by the confession
of her enemies.</p>

<p>While she ever and always teaches
the unchangeable truths and precepts
given by her Divine Founder, she is ready
to accept and bless what she finds
of good among men, and labors to eliminate
what is evil. From Greece she
took what was pure in poetry and the
fine arts, and true in philosophy. From
Rome she gathered what was just and
good in her admirable jurisprudence.
Yet, even in the face of bitter persecution,
she failed not to denounce immorality,
however decked in classic verse;
atheism and impiety, however clothed
in words of seeming intellectual wisdom;
and cruel tyranny, however upheld by
power and authority, or made sacred by
antiquity and the prejudices or manners
of a people. In after times, under the
debauched and luxurious rule of the
Byzantine emperors, and still later,
When the northern barbarians had overrun
western Europe and destroyed all
government, her powerful influence was
felt. Hers was the only voice which
could reach and in some measure control
the fierce men who sat on thrones
they had built with the sword, or could
bring peace and the consolations of religion
to the hovel of the poor and oppressed.
She checked immorality and injustice
and taught obedience to law. No
one will now contest the truth, that it is
to her the modern world owes what
knowledge we have of the olden classic
civilization. But for her, it would be as
dead to us as that of Assyria is to the
wild Arabs who pitch their tents on the
mounds of Kouyunjik and Khorsabad.
To her it owes those grand principles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695">[695]</a></span>
of law and justice, of stable government
and individual rights, of holy marriage,
and of arts and science, which go to
constitute civilization. The church of
Christ cannot be wanting in any emergency
of men. It is her office to establish
order where else chaos would reign.</p>

<p>Hence it is that in this present crisis,
this time of so much good and so much
evil, so many hopes and such great
danger, she renews and increases her
efforts, as of old, that what is good may
be increased and confirmed, what is
evil may be diminished or eliminated.
She devotes to the work her most solemn
and effective mode of action&mdash;an
&oelig;cumenical council.</p>

<p>Assuredly no more remarkable event
has occurred in this nineteenth century
than the meeting of this &OElig;cumenical
Council of the Vatican, formally opened
in Rome on December 8th last, the
feast of the Immaculate Conception.
The civilized world seems conscious of
its importance. Catholics and Protestants,
believers and infidels, all treat of
it, some with full faith and earnest hope,
some with a dim sense of reverence,
some with curiosity, and some with hatred.
But none can ignore or despise
it. The books that have been published,
the stream of pamphlets in every
language that is flooding Europe, the
countless articles of every character in
countless newspapers of every hue&mdash;all
bear witness to the universal interest in
an assembly so extraordinary in its character,
and destined to wield so great a
moral influence.</p>

<p>Men are struck with wonder at this
singular and hitherto unprecedented representation
of the whole world. The
number of members is in itself large.
There were present at the opening
session, 5 cardinal bishops, 36 cardinal
priests, 8 cardinal deacons, 9 patriarchs,
4 primates, 124 archbishops, 481 bishops,
6 abbots with <i>quasi</i>-episcopal
jurisdiction, 22 mitred abbots, and 29
superiors of religious orders; in all,
719 of the 1050, or thereabouts, who
would have the right to enter. Many
dioceses in the world are vacant, the
venerable bishops of others are too
aged to travel so far, some are detained
by illness and will come later, and some,
to their regret, are detained by the special
circumstances of their own dioceses.
None of those under the Czar of Russia
have come. His Tartar policy threw
them into dungeons, where some died.
Those that lived he sent to Siberia,
some for their religion, some for being
Poles. But among the bishops here
every other nation of Europe has a full
and strong representation. Besides all
these, there are also forty-nine from the
United States, eighteen or twenty from
Canada and the British possessions of
North America, and over forty from
Mexico and the various states of South
America. The eastern and the western
shores of Africa have sent several;
two have come from British Africa, at
the south, and quite a number&mdash;among
them a Coptic bishop from Egypt&mdash;represent
the dioceses along the Mediterranean
shores of Africa. All the ancient
oriental rites of the church have
patriarchs, archbishops, and bishops in
the council; India, Thibet, China, Japan
itself, Australia, New Zealand, and the
isles of the Pacific are fully represented.
Never before in the history of the
world was there seen such a gathering
of prelates from the uttermost parts of
the earth. And the members who compose
the council deserve individually
special attention. They are chosen men,
holding in their several homes posts
of dignity, responsibility, and authority.
The Catholic Church is in one aspect
eminently democratic. She will take
into the roll of her clergy men of
every rank and station. She asks not
what was their condition or their lineage.
If a clergyman possess piety, learning,
zeal, and administrative ability, the door
is open for his preferment, even to her
highest offices. If Pius IX. is noble
born, his predecessor, Gregory XVI.,
was the son of a poor village baker, and
owed his earliest education, and his entrance
into the sanctuary, to the gratuitous
kindness of a good monk, who was
attracted by the bright eyes and intelligent
look of the modest little boy, as he
used to carry around to customers the
loaves his father had baked. So too of
these bishops. Some may be of lordly,
or noble, or princely lineage. Others
were born in humble, thatched cottages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696">[696]</a></span>
Here they are equal. Some have doffed
the ermine, some have quitted the bar,
others left the army, where their names
are still mentioned with praise and soldierly
pride by their old companions in
arms. Some have given up to younger
brothers wealth and titles, that they
might freely devote themselves to God's
holy work. Some, filled with apostolic
zeal, have given up friends and home
and country to go to distant lands to
preach Christ and him crucified; and
some have been honored with chains
and imprisonment and stripes for
Christ's sake. They all pursued a long
career of preparatory studies, they were
afterward tried by long years of practice
in the ministry, and have finally
been chosen as qualified for their important
and responsible positions. Differing,
as they do, in language and nationalities
and human feelings and prejudices,
they have all the same faith,
the same zeal, and have all come together
at the summons of their common
father. They all gather around the
chair of Peter.</p>

<p>Well may the world look with wonder
at such an assembly as this, containing
so much of learning, such strength of
character, such personal worth, wielding
so much power over the minds and consciences
of men, possessing such an intimate,
practical knowledge of the whole
world, of the good and the bad in it,
and of the needs of men&mdash;an assembly
every member of which has learned, by
years of ministerial duty, to read, as no
others can, the heart of man, and where
all have come together with the same
earnest purpose, and in the same singleness
of heart, to confer candidly and
frankly with each other, in order, with
the aid and light of heavenly grace, to
determine on such measures as shall
best promote the glory of God, the interests
of religion, and the spread of truth
and virtue among men. Even to the
man of the world, not to say to the
Christian, can any thing be nobler or
more worthy of respect than such a
meeting? Must not every honest heart
rejoice in the effort they will make, and
wish them success?</p>

<p>But to the Catholic this &oelig;cumenical
council has a higher character. We
know that the church was founded not
by man, but by Christ himself; that she
stands, not by human learning or human
wisdom and prudence, but by the power
of God; that Christ is ever with her,
that he has sent his Holy Spirit, the Spirit
of truth, to abide with her for ever, to
teach her all truth, to recall to her mind
all things whatsoever he taught, and that
so she is to us the pillar and ground
of truth. We look back and see that in
all the great emergencies of Christian
truth, or rather emergencies of the world,
it has been her custom to call together
her bishops in councils like this. Thus,
when Arianism arose, and the minds of
simple men were thrown into confusion
and perplexity concerning the divinity
of the Saviour by the wily quotations
of Scripture and the plausible teachings
of error, the Council of Nice declared
clearly and emphatically the original
doctrine of the divinity of the Son; and
guarded it by establishing the consecrated
terms in which thenceforth
Christian lips should express it. So,
too, when Nestorius and Eutyches, and
other later heresiarchs arose, other
councils were held, solemnly setting
forth the original doctrines received and
held by the church, and pointing out
and condemning the opposite errors.
So, too, in the sixteenth century the
Council of Trent met and gave to the
world a full and clear statement of the
Catholic doctrine of justification, so violently
assailed by Luther and his followers
and companions&mdash;a doctrine, by
the way, which no small portion of those
non-Catholics who still retain a belief
in an actual divine revelation, now receive
substantially and admit to be the
only doctrine on that head reconcilable
with reason and common sense.</p>

<p>So, too, in this nineteenth century,
amid the confusing uncertainties of men,
and the discordant clashing of opinions
in the world, we turn with reverent hope,
with fullest confidence in the words of
the Saviour, and with grateful hearts and
willing minds, to this first &OElig;cumenical
Council of the Vatican. We recognize
in it the same authority which spoke
at Nice, at Ephesus, and at Chalcedon,
at Constantinople, at Lyons, and at the
Lateran, and in Trent. We await the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_697" id="Page_697">[697]</a></span>
words of its teaching and its precepts
of discipline. For it will speak with authority.
"It hath seemed good to the
Holy Ghost and to us."</p>

<p>Our readers are no doubt familiar with
the chief antecedents of the council. It
was in his address to the bishops assembled
in Rome in June, 1867, to celebrate
the centenary of St. Peter's martyrdom,
that the Holy Father made the
first public and official announcement of
what had been for a short time before
mooted and considered in private. It
was his desire, at as early a day as circumstances
would allow, to convene the
bishops of the Catholic world in an
&oelig;cumenical council. The prelates present,
about five hundred in number, expressed
their gratification and cordial
assent. The attacks of the Garibaldians
in November, 1867, if successful,
would probably have frustrated the design.
But under divine Providence it
signally failed. Some thought that the
bull of convocation would appear in
December, 1867. But it was not published
until the midsummer of 1868, and
the council was summoned for December
8th, 1869. It was a solemn work.
All felt that a most important day was
approaching in the history of the church.
Throughout the world, ever since, in
every church and religious house, as
often as the priest ascended the altar to
celebrate the divine mysteries, or those
vowed to the Lord assembled to sing
his praises, petitions were offered unceasingly
that God would bless the
council, and give to the prelates such
light and grace as would lead them to
speak and act for his greater glory and
the welfare of souls. As months rolled
on and the time approached, clergy and
faithful throughout the world united
with redoubled fervor in triduums, novenas,
and suitable religious exercises
to obtain this special favor from Heaven.</p>

<p>In order that when the prelates
should come, they might not be detained
too long from their dioceses attending
the council&mdash;as was the case at
Trent&mdash;it was deemed advisable to establish
preparatory committees of chosen
theologians to study maturely such
questions as it was thought would probably
come up or be proposed in the
council. In Rome, the centre of theological
learning, there were eminent theologians
in abundance from whom to
choose. But it was felt that something
more was needed. To erudition must
be added an intimate knowledge of the
modes of thought and the practical needs
of the various nations; something which
books alone cannot give. Hence, eminent
theologians from France, Germany,
England, Ireland, and other
countries were invited, and sent to
Rome as representative men of their
respective countries. From the United
States, the Very Rev. Dr. Corcoran,
of Charleston, South Carolina, whom our
bishops had learned to appreciate as
secretary to our Second Plenary Council
of Baltimore, was chosen for this
purpose, and came to Rome fifteen
months ago. The choice was a most
happy one. He has won the esteem
and respect of all by his simple and
quiet dignity of manner, the vastness
of his learning, and, more than all, by
his sound judgment and practical good
sense. I believe he stands in the council
as one of the theologians to the
pope. Five committees, thus formed of
Roman and foreign theologians, each
under the presidency of a cardinal, have
for nearly a year and a half been engaged
in an exhaustive study of the subjects
most likely to come up. Their
dissertations and essays on such points
have been printed for the private use of
the bishops, and being up to the day,
must be of great use, and will naturally
aid much in expediting business.</p>

<p>Other material preparations were necessary.
The sessions of the council
were to be held in the north arm of
the Transept of St. Peter's&mdash;that which
stretches toward the Vatican Palace.
The place assigned had to be fitted up
with appropriate decorations and suitable
furniture. Other places were to be
prepared for the general congregations&mdash;committees
of the whole, as they would
be termed in the United States&mdash;and
for particular congregations, or special
committees. Beyond this, many of the
bishops who would desire to attend
would be too poor to pay the exorbitant
rates which landlords here and elsewhere
know how to ask when a city is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698">[698]</a></span>
crowded&mdash;as Rome would be&mdash;perhaps
might be too poor to pay any thing.
Such should be the guests of the Holy
Father. He would provide for them.
This was obviously the case with many
of the Italian bishops. The kingdom
of Italy has seized and turned over to
the national treasury all ecclesiastical
property, promising, as a partial compensation
instead, to pay the clergy a
stated stipend from the government.
As might be expected from persons capable
of committing such wholesale and
barefaced robbery, the promise, in too
many instances, has never been kept. I
apprehend that the vast majority of
the clergy of Italy are now managing
to feed, clothe, and lodge themselves on
an average of twenty cents a day. The
number of such bishops from Italy, with
others from the East, and from distant
and very poor missions, may amount to
one hundred and fifty or two hundred.</p>

<p>All this would cost money, and the
pope himself, stripped of four fifths of
the territory of the States of the Church,
but not stripped, as yet, of the old public
debt, the interest of which he is
struggling to meet punctually, is poor.
The earnest Catholics of every country
knew his condition and poured in contributions
for this purpose. Last autumn
the papers announced that all due
preparations were being actively pushed
forward.</p>

<p>In October, bishops began to arrive.
The first comers were from the East,
who had set out early. In their countries
men travel slowly, and time is not
so precious. Perhaps, too, some thought
they might be as long on the journey as
their records and traditions said their
predecessors had been four hundred
years ago, when they came to the Council
of Florence. The European and
western bishops were better acquainted
with the speed of railways and steamers,
and began to pour in only in the latter
portion of November. By the 1st of
December, fully five hundred had arrived,
and the week that followed saw two
hundred more come in. Every courtesy
was shown them. As a train crossed
the frontier into the Pontifical States,
an officer ascertained the names of all
the bishops, telegraphed the information
to Rome, and, on their arrival, they
found other officials ready to welcome
them, and to escort them in carriages to
their several destinations. Their baggage,
too, was exempt from custom-house
inspection. This, however, was
a favor scarcely confined to the Pontifical
States. In more than one instance,
bishops have passed from the United
States, through England, France, and
(strange contrast to 1867) even through
Northern Italy, without having their
trunks once opened. It were to be
wished that the annoying and now useless
system of passports were done
away with. It has scarcely any advantage
save that of giving fees to consuls
and employees.</p>

<p>On December 2d, the Holy Father delivered
to the bishops then in Rome,
assembled in the Sixtine chapel, an allocution
in preparation for the council;
and they received printed copies of an
apostolical letter, dated November 27th,
settling some matters for the good order
of the council, and the dispatch of
business. Chapter i. reiterates the
laws of the church, and enjoins on all
the duty of living piously, and of carefully
maintaining an exemplary demeanor.
Chapter ii. declares the full liberty
of each bishop to propose any
matter which he thinks of importance.
But that all things may be done in order,
and without unnecessary confusion,
and consequent delay of other matters,
such propositions must be submitted in
writing, must be supported by some
show of reason, must be of a character
to concern more than one or two dioceses
only, and must not run counter
to the constant sense and inviolable
traditions of the church. A special
committee shall be appointed by the
pope to receive such propositions, and
to consider whether they fulfil the required
conditions, to report to the pope.
The committee has since been appointed.
The Archbishop of Baltimore is a
member of it. Chapter iii. charges all
to keep silence on the matters under
discussion. The council will hardly be
as leaky as Congress, and our readers
will do well to pay little or no attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">[699]</a></span>
to the thousand and one reports that
will be circulated in the newspapers.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>Chapter iv. declares that the seats shall
be occupied according to grades of the
hierarchy, and seniority of promotion.
Other chapters set forth the officials,
secretaries, notaries, masters of ceremonies,
etc.&mdash;a matter of obvious necessity
under the circumstances; establish
six general committees, the members of
which are to be elected by ballot; and
make known some points of order to
be observed in the religious exercises
of the public sessions and the general
congregations; and finally enjoin on the
bishops attending the council to remain
until the close of it, forbidding any one
to depart before such close, save with
regular leave of absence, duly applied
for and obtained.</p>

<p>With a copy of this letter the bishops
also received pamphlets containing the
forms of prayers to be used, and a detailed
account of the ceremonial to be
followed, all based on or extracted from
the ceremonial of the ancient councils.</p>

<p>For the people little preparation had
been made, or indeed could be made in
the church. St. Peter's has no pews;
you will not find even benches or chairs.
On grand occasions, when the pope is
celebrant, seats are placed in the arms
of the transept, capable of holding six
or eight thousand persons, who are admitted
by ticket, and must come in the
proper costume. They are chiefly occupied
by ladies. But on this occasion
one half of this space was required for
the council. On the other hand, Rome
would be full, and it was felt that not
one twentieth of those who would desire,
and indeed who would ordinarily
be entitled to receive tickets for such
reserved seats, could be accommodated.
The gordian knot was cut by dispensing
with reserved seats altogether, and leaving
full play to the democratic principle
of <i>first come, first served</i>.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Rome was in commotion,
and given over to the mercies
of free-trade in lodgings. Householders
were waylaying strangers, striving
to let their apartments at the highest
possible rates. Strangers were wandering
about seeking apartments which
they might obtain on the lowest possible
terms. Purchases were briskly made
in preparation for the morrow. Everywhere,
all day long, in carriages and on
foot, and in all the different costumes
of their several nations, might be seen
bishops and priests passing to and fro,
visiting the churches and the shrines of
martyrs, or seeking out some friend of
their youth, whom they had not seen,
perhaps, for twenty-five or forty years,
but who, they were told, had just arrived
in Rome.</p>

<p>At noon precisely, the booming of the
great bell of St. Peter's came over the
Campus Martius and the seven hills of
Rome. Instantly the thousand bells of
the three hundred churches of the Eternal
City answered in one united clamorous
peal; and the cannon of St. Angelo,
and the heavier metal of the new Aventine
Fort, chimed in with the deep bass
of a grand national salute. And thus,
for an hour, was heralded the near approach
of the great day. Again at
nightfall the salute was repeated.</p>

<p>The morning of December 8th dawned&mdash;the
Festival of the Immaculate Conception,
and the day fixed for opening
the council. A third repetition of the
uproarious yet thrilling salutation awaked
the sluggards, if there were any. We
say if there were any; for although the
clouds were hanging low and heavy, and
the air was filled with mist, and at times
the rain poured down, all Rome was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_700" id="Page_700">[700]</a></span>
astir. By five <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, the murmur of voices
and the tramping of pedestrians filled
every street, and soon the rolling of
carriages over the hard pavements
sounded like distant thunder. By six
<span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, tens of thousands were wending
their way, despite the weather, to St.
Peter's; and by seven, every eligible portion
of the floor of the vast basilica was
crowded. At half-past seven, the cardinals,
archbishops, and bishops began to
gather in the Vatican Palace, where they
robed, putting on white copes and mitres,
and then passed to the great
hall at the front, and immediately over
the vestibule of St. Peter's. Here the
masters of ceremony assigned to each
one his proper place, and they awaited
the coming of the sovereign pontiff.</p>

<p>Punctual to the moment, he appeared.
All knelt in prayer. In a clear and sonorous
voice he intoned the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Veni Creator
Spiritus</i>. The choir took up the
strain, the bishops arose, and commenced
to move in procession back to the
Vatican Palace, through the ducal hall,
down the unequalled Scala Regia, and
into the vestibule of St. Peter's. Along
the line the voice of chanting was
heard. Without, the air was filled again
with the sound of bells and the booming
of cannon.</p>

<p>It was not like the grand processions
on which Rome delights to look every
year. The young orphan boys, with
their snow-white dresses and angel
faces, the various religious orders, Capuchins,
Franciscans, Minor Observantists,
Conventuals, Carmelites, Augustinians,
Cistercians, Benedictines, Dominicans,
and Canons Regular, in their
varied and picturesque dresses, did not
walk in it. There were no confraternities
with their huge crosses, no groups
of clergy from the many parish churches,
no chapters of the ancient basilicas
with their tent-like canopies and tolling
bells. These appeared not in the ranks;
but delegates from all of them formed
lines on either side, between which, as
guards, the prelates marched two and
two, each one attended by his chaplain.
It was a procession such as the world
has seen but once before, and that six
hundred years ago, at the Second Council
of Lyons. First came the cross, surrounded
with burning lights and clouds
of incense from the censers, and a group
of ecclesiastics attached to the Vatican
and to St. Peter's. On came the long
white line of mitred abbots, bishops,
archbishops, primates, patriarchs, and
cardinals, slowly moving, joining in the
chanted hymn, or else with subdued
voices reciting psalms and prayers.
The hall, the grand stairway, and the
vestibule were packed by thousands
who despaired of being able to enter the
church, and hoped at least to look on the
procession. All eyes seemed to scrutinize
the line of prelates with reverent
curiosity. Some in the line had not yet
lost the smoothness of their cheeks.
They had not yet closed their eighth
lustre. The great majority had passed
the half-century of life. Labors, cares,
and study had brought furrows to many
a brow and many a cheek; gray hairs
had come, often prematurely; but the
firm step told of still unexhausted
strength. Their faces, full of intellect
and decision, told of long and sturdy labor
in the vineyard; you felt they could
still bear the heat of the day and the
brunt of labor. Many of them, too,
far more than the younger ones, were
aged and venerable prelates, who, like
the rest, had come at the summons of
the chief pastor. But when they should
have borne their testimony to the faith
in this council, they would soon say,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nunc dimittis</i>.</p>

<p>It was a glorious line. The spectators,
of every nation, looked to recognize
the bishops each of his own land.
They pointed out and whispered to each
other the names of those who had won
for themselves a world-wide reputation
in the church, and looked with special
attention on the oriental prelates, scattered
here and there through the line,
robed, not like those of the Latin rite, in
unadorned white copes and white linen
mitres, but in richly ornamented chasubles
or copes of oriental fashion, glittering
with gold and precious stones and
bright colors, and wearing on their
heads tiaras radiant with gems. On
they passed, Italians, Greeks, Germans,
Persians, Syrians, Hungarians, Spanish
and Copt, Irish and French, Scotch
and Brazilian, Mexican and English,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_701" id="Page_701">[701]</a></span>
American and Chinese, Canadian and
South American and Australian; abbots,
bishops, archbishops, primates,
and patriarchs.</p>

<p>Next came the cardinals&mdash;the senate
of the church. If before you saw the
strength of the church, here you looked
on the embodiment of intelligence
and wisdom, in the most venerable body
in the world. Spotless purity of life,
brilliant talents, long study, a longer experience
of men and affairs in a series
of responsible offices worthily filled&mdash;a
thorough devotion of all their powers to
the interests of religion, have led them
to this dignity&mdash;Antonelli, Bilio, Bonnechose,
Cullen, Schwartzenberg, Hohenlohe,
Barnabo, Pitra, Patrizi&mdash;every one
seemed worthy of, and to receive, special
homage as they slowly moved on.</p>

<p>But even they were forgotten as the
Holy Father approached. Surrounded
by his chaplains and attendants, by
Swiss guards in their picturesque costume,
designed, it is said, with an eye
to effect, by Michael Angelo himself,
and by the Roman noble guard in their
richest uniforms, he came borne, according
to the old Roman custom which has
come down from the times of the republic,
in a curule chair, such as ediles
and senators were borne in; such as
that which the convert Senator Pudens
appropriated to the Apostle St. Peter,
which he and many of his successors
used, and which is still preserved with
care and veneration in St. Peter's. Pius
IX. is, we believe, really eighty-one
years of age. He is still robust, wonderfully
so for that age. His countenance
beams still with that paternal
benevolence which has such power to
charm. None ever looked on him without
feeling it. No one, Catholic or Protestant,
Israelite, Turk, or infidel, ever
left his presence without carrying away
a sense of reverence, and sweet memories
of a blessing received. All knelt as
he was borne by, blessing them on either
side. In his train followed other attendants
and the superiors of religious orders,
who enter the council, but are not
privileged to wear mitres. Conspicuous
among them was the thin, ascetic,
fleshless form of the superior-general of
the Jesuits, in black&mdash;the little black
pope, as they call him in Rome.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the head of the procession
has long since reached the grand portals
of the Basilica. From the door to the
central line of the transept is about four
hundred feet, and the nave of the church
is about ninety-five feet wide. All this
space is crowded with people standing
so jammed together that there is not
room to kneel, if one wished. Back on
either side, under the broad arches, and
into the side aisles, the vast mass of
humanity extends. The bases of the
columns and piers are seen to rise to
the level of their heads, and, guided by
this measure, the eye, for once, catches
at a glance the immense proportions
of this gigantic building. The partition
which cuts off a portion of the transept
for the special use of the council is not
seen from the nave, and the church
stands before you in all the grandeur of
its architecture, unchanged for better or
for worse by those vast masses of drapery
and those lines of galloon, and the
hundreds of immense chandeliers which
sometimes are placed here to adorn it.
To the Roman eye, familiar with every
detail of the building, such an adornment
may be pleasing as a change.
But strangers love to see St. Peter's as
they see it now, in its own native beauty
and majesty. The eye loves to pass
from the noble columns and the statues
of pure Carrara to the unfading mosaics,
the variegated marbles of the walls and
piers, the ornaments in sculptured relief,
the richly-wrought capitals, the vast
line of cornice of classic accuracy, and
the lofty arched ceiling, one hundred
and fifty feet and more overhead, profusely
decorated with panelling, roses,
and richest gilding. It travels on to
the main altar with its hundred ever-burning
lamps around the tomb of the
great apostle of Rome, and the spiral
columns and canopy of bronze which
rise full ninety feet above it. And hundreds
of feet further away, in the western
apsis, you catch a view of the bronze
statues of the four great doctors of the
church, who support the identical chair
of St. Peter, and of the circular window
of stained glass through which the Holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_702" id="Page_702">[702]</a></span>
Dove seems to pour in a stream of
golden light, giving life and heavenly
beauty to that other flood which pours
down into the church from the lofty
dome.</p>

<p>Guards had kept free for the procession
a passage-way through the crowd,
from the door to the main altar. Up
this lane the bishops walked with uncovered
heads, for the blessed sacrament
was exposed on the altar. Kneeling a
moment in adoration, they arose, and,
turning to the right, passed into the
space set aside and prepared for the
council hall. To each one, as he entered,
his proper place was assigned by the
masters of ceremony. The greater part
were so placed, when a fuller burst of
the choir told us that the Holy Father
had reached the portals of the church,
had been received by the chapter of
canons, and was entering. He left the
curule chair and doffed his mitre; for a
greater than he is here enthroned, and
even the pope must walk with uncovered
head. He, and the cardinals with
him, knelt at the main altar as the bishops
had done, and waited until the
last strophe of the hymn, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Veni Sancte
Spiritus</i>, was finished by the choir. He
arose, chanted the versicle and prayer to
the Holy Ghost, and then, preceded by
the cardinals, also entered the council
hall. They passed each to his proper
place, the pontiff to a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">prie Dieu</i> prepared
for him in the middle, to await the
commencement of the high mass.</p>

<p>We have said that this council hall
occupies nearly all of the northern arm
of the great transept. That arm alone
is over two hundred feet long, and ninety-five
feet broad. Its northern extremity
is a semi-circular apsis, and midway
of its length it is crossed by the
northern aisle of the church, which opens
into it by a lofty and wide arch on either
side. These arches are now closed at
the top by temporary partition walls.
In front&mdash;that is, on the south, toward
the main altar and nave&mdash;another partition
wall, perhaps fifty feet high, shuts
the hall off from the main body of the
building. All these walls are exquisitely
colored, so as to correspond even in
minute details with the decorations and
color of the marbles of the church. In
the last-named wall is a large doorway,
fully twenty feet wide, through which
the prelates and cardinals and the pontiff
have passed in. It is open now,
(though when necessary it can be closed,)
and you may look in and see the interior
arrangement. In the further extremity,
the semi-circular apsis, a number of steps
rise to a platform, in the middle of which
other steps lead to the throne of the
pontiff, surmounted by a canopy with
hanging drapery. On either hand, elevated
one step less, are placed the cardinals,
before each one a kneeling-stand,
which may be changed into a writing-desk.
Before the cardinals, and a little
lower, sit the patriarchs. Down either
side of the hall, for the full length, run
seven rows of benches with high backs.
The front row is on the floor, the others
rising as they recede, so that the
last one next the wall is about the same
level with the platform. In the middle,
about one fifth of the way from the door,
with its face toward the pope and the
bishops, and its back toward the door
stands a temporary altar prepared for
the mass, with which every public session
and every general congregation will
commence. Here and there, on the
floor, are seats and tables for the use of
the secretaries, notaries, stenographers,
and other officials. Of the altar we
need not speak. It is simple though
rich in materials, and without accessory
ornamentation, which would take up
space and impede the view. The platform
is covered, as is the floor, with
Brussels carpeting. The seats of the
cardinals are covered with red damask;
those of the patriarchs with purple.
The seats of the bishops are covered
with Brussels tapestry of a greenish hue.
They are roomy. Each bishop uses the
back of the seat before him as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">prie
Dieu</i> when he kneels. Should he at
other times wish to write, there is a table
hinged to it in front of him, which
he may raise up and render firm by a
movable support. When he is done, he
simply moves back the support and lets
down the table to its former position.
All is simple, yet very satisfactory.
There is, near at hand, a refreshment
room, and, indeed, every convenience
that is needed. The artistic decorations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_703" id="Page_703">[703]</a></span>
of the hall also deserve attention.
They are not many, but are excellent
and appropriate, and were prepared,
of course, for this occasion. Over the
doorway, as you are about to enter from
the church, there is a majestic painting
of the Saviour enthroned in the clouds,
holding the Gospel open in his left
hand, while the right is stretched forth
in command to the apostles. Underneath
is the inscription, "<span class="smcap">Go, teach
all nations. I am with you all
days, even to the consummation of
the world</span>." In the interior of the
hall, over the seat of the pope, is a
painting of the Descent of the Holy
Ghost. On either side are the Council
of the Apostles at Jerusalem, and the
Councils of Nice, of Ephesus, and of
Trent. Higher up are large medallion
paintings of the twenty-two popes who
called or presided personally or by
legates over the various &oelig;cumenical
councils of the church; while higher
still are colossal figures of the four great
doctors of the church, St. Ambrose, St.
Augustine, St. Jerome, and St. John
Chrysostom. All the seats we have
mentioned are for the prelates and officials.
There are several galleries opening
through the wall rather than projecting
forward. On the left of the
pope, as he is seated, is one for the singers
of the Sistine chapel. On his right
is another, to be occupied by sovereigns
and members of royal families. The
Empress of Austria, the Queen of
Würtemberg, and the King of Naples
were present at the opening. Another
much larger one, on the side of the singers,
is for the diplomatic corps. It was
filled with ambassadors in their state
uniforms, with full display of jewelled
decorations. Two other similar galleries
are for the theologians.</p>

<p>The council hall, as we have described
it, is about two hundred feet long and
nearly one hundred feet broad. The ceiling
above is that of the transept; like
that of the nave, arched, panelled, and decorated
with gilding, and is one hundred
and fifty feet above you. The seemingly
low partition wall in front shuts out the
view of the lower portions of the church,
but you have a full view of the upper
half of the columns and piers, with
their statues and decorations, and of
the cornice and lofty-arched ceiling, and
above all, of the magnificent dome, with
its mosaics of the evangelists and the
angelic host. You see and feel all the
time that you are in St. Peter's. But
there are drawbacks. The size of the
hall, the height of the ceiling, and, perhaps
more than either, this want of disconnection
from the church, render it
impossible for any but the strongest
voices with eminently clear enunciation
to fill it and be understood. Weak, and
even moderate voices, are simply inaudible
to the majority. As things are
now arranged, discussion would seem
impossible, and already there is talk of
changes which may have to be indicated
in our next article. But let us return
to the pope and the bishops, whom we
left awaiting the commencement of the
pontifical high mass. This should have
been celebrated by Cardinal Mattei, the
dean of the body. But his age and infirmities
are too great to permit so great
an exertion. Accordingly, the next in
rank, Cardinal Patrizi, took his place,
and was the celebrant. The pontiff approached
the altar with him, recited the
<i>Judica</i> and the <i>Confiteor</i>, and then retired
to his own seat, and the cardinal
ascended to the altar and continued the
mass. The music was that of Palestrina,
executed by the papal choir as
they alone can sing, and without any instrumental
accompaniment. Such voices
as theirs need none. Just before the
last gospel, a portable pulpit was brought
out near the altar; Mgr. Passavalli,
Archbishop of Iconium, ascended it,
wearing cope and mitre, and preached
the introductory sermon. It was in
Latin&mdash;the language of the council&mdash;and
occupied just forty minutes. It has
since been published, and the reader
will not fail to recognize and admire the
eloquence and fervor of his thoughts
and the elegance of his Latinity. But
no pages can give an idea of the clear,
ringing voice, the musical Italian intonations,
and the dignified and impressive,
almost impassioned gesture of the
truly eloquent Capuchin. The sermon
over, the pope gave the solemn blessing,
the Gospel of St. John was recited, and
the mass was over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_704" id="Page_704">[704]</a></span></p>

<p>The altar being now clear, the attendants
brought in a rich, throne-like
stand, and placed it on the altar in the
centre. Monsignor Fessler, secretary of
the council, attended by his assistant,
brought in procession a large book of
the Gospels, elegantly bound, and reverently
placed it on the throne. It was
the place due to the inspired record of
the life and teachings of our divine
Lord&mdash;a ceremony touching and most
appropriate at the opening of a council
of his followers, assembled in his name,
to declare and vindicate his teaching,
and promote and carry out the commission
he gave them.</p>

<p>The Holy Father then assumed his full
pontifical robes. The cardinals and all
the prelates, in their proper order, then
approached, one by one, to pay him homage,
kissing his hand or the stole he wore.
Their numbers made it a long ceremony.
It told of the union of all with the head
of the church.</p>

<p>This over, all knelt while the pontiff
chanted the sublime prayer, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Adsumus,
Domine</i>. Solemn and subdued were
the chanted <i>amens</i> of the entire assembly.</p>

<p>Four chanters next intoned the litany
of the saints in the well-known varying
minor strains of Gregorian chant. Most
impressive were the responses made by
the united voices of the fathers. But
when, at the proper time, the pope rose
to his feet, and, holding the cross of his
authority in his left hand, replaced the
chanters, and raising his streaming eyes
to heaven, and in his own majestic and
sonorous tones, trembling just enough
to tell how deeply his great heart was
moved, thrice prayed our divine Lord
to bless, to preserve, to consecrate this
council, tears flowed from many an
eye. All were intensely moved, and
not bishops alone, but the crowds
of clergy outside, and thousands of
the laity, joined, again and again, in
the response, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te rogamus, audi nos</i>.
Then, if never before, St. Peter's was
filled with the mighty volume of sound.
Back it came to us from arch and
chapel, from aisle and lofty nave and
transept, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te rogamus, audi nos</i>. We
seemed to hear it murmured even from
the aerial dome, as if the angels repeated
the words as they bore the petition to
heaven, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te rogamus, audi nos</i>.</p>

<p>The chanters resumed, the litany
was terminated, and the pope recited the
prayers that follow it. Cardinal Borromeo
then, acting as deacon, chanted
the Gospel taken from Luke x., narrating
the mission of the disciples. He used
the volume that had been enthroned on
the altar. When he concluded, the volume
was carried back as before, and reverently
replaced on the throne. The assembly
were seated, and the Holy Father,
himself seated and wearing his mitre,
delivered a discourse or allocution full,
as all his discourses are, of unction, and
replete with the thoughts and words of
divine inspiration.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of this discourse
all knelt, and the Holy Father again intoned
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Veni Creator Spiritus</i>. The
choir took it up, and the members of the
council responded in the alternate strophes.
The pope sang the versicles and
prayer that follow it, and all again were
seated.</p>

<p>The secretary now mounted the pulpit
and read aloud the first proposed decree,
"That this Holy Vatican Council
be, and is now opened." The fathers
all answered, <i>Placet</i>; the pope gave his
sanction; the formal decree was passed
and proclaimed, and the notaries instructed
to make an official record of it.</p>

<p>A second decree was similarly proposed,
voted, and sanctioned, fixing the
second public session for the festival of
the Epiphany, January 6th, 1870. The
first general congregation was announced
for Friday, December 10th, in the
same hall of the council.</p>

<p>This closed the proceedings of the
first public session, which necessarily
were purely formal. The Holy Father
arose and intoned the solemn <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te Deum</i>
of thanksgiving. The choir&mdash;the unrivalled
one of the Sixtine chapel&mdash;took
up the strain, intertwining the melody
with subdued but artistic harmonies.
The assembled bishops, the clergy without,
thousands of the laity, familiar from
childhood with the varying strains of
its Gregorian chant, responded with one
accord, in the second verse of the grand
old Ambrosian hymn. The choir sang
the third verse as before, the crowd responded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_705" id="Page_705">[705]</a></span>
with the fourth, and so on they
alternated to the end. It is impossible
to tell in words the thrilling power
of such a union of voices. It moved,
overcame, subdued one. It was impossible
to resist it if you would. Tears
came unbidden to the eye, and the lip
quivered as you instinctively united your
voice to that of the multitude. No one
sought to make himself heard, all united
in those subdued, thrilling tones in
which the heart speaks. Catholic and
Protestant all felt it. Even the infidel for
the time believed, and, bowing his head,
joined in this praise and thanksgiving
to God.</p>

<p>At half-past two, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te Deum</i> was
finished, and the services closed. The
Holy Father unrobed, and withdrew with
his attendants. But it was past three
ere all the bishops could issue from the
hall and leave the church. The crowds
looked on as they slowly departed,
their own numbers long remaining
seemingly undiminished. Many could
not tear themselves away from the hallowed
spot. The shades of evening
found hundreds still lingering there, contemplating
the place where they had
seen the hierarchy of the church gathered
around the chief pastor, or kneeling
in prayer at the tomb of the great apostle
to whom our Lord said, "On this
rock I will build my church."</p>

<p>Since the day of the opening session,
two general congregations have been
held. The chief work has been to organize
and elect members for the various
committees. Where all are desirous of
having the best men on these committees,
the bishops seem to consider it
well to proceed slowly, until they gain
an acquaintance with each other, which
will enable them to act with greater
knowledge. Meanwhile they are evidently
studying up the matters before
them. What those subjects are, no one
outside their body appears as yet to
know. They are remarkably reticent,
and so far have not been "interviewed"
by newspaper reporters.</p>

<p>It is thought the council must last
several months. But at the present
stage not even the prelates themselves
can form more than a vague conjecture
on this head. It may be that a month
will throw light on the subject. In that
case, we may be able to speak more definitely
in our next article on the council.</p>

<h2>FOREIGN LITERARY NOTES.</h2>


<p>The renowned Captain Dugald Dalgetty,
that redoubtable man of war, orthodoxy,
and <i>provant</i>, firmly held and
was known occasionally to express the
opinion that Gustavus Adolphus, King
of Sweden, was the Lion of the North
and the <i>bulwark of Protestantism</i>. In
so far as the 'bulwark' was concerned,
that clever soldado merely reflected the
estimate of the Swedish hero held by
the contemporary Protestant world&mdash;an
estimate still clung to by the same world
of the nineteenth century. That opinion
and that estimate have lately received
fatal injury in the house of their friends.
For thus has it come about. Catholic
historians have never hesitated to state
that the facts bore them out in claiming
that the governing motive of Gustavus
Adolphus in taking the important part
he did in the Thirty Years' War, was
not religious enthusiasm, nor even a religious
motive; but on the contrary one
that was far from possessing any greater
elevation than self-interest and political
advantage. So thought and wrote
Hurter and other Catholic authors. Of
course these authors were not listened
to in the Protestant world any more
than were vindications of Mary, Queen
of Scots, until they began to come from
Protestant pens. But in the course of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_706" id="Page_706">[706]</a></span>
a few succeeding years no less than four
distinguished Protestant historians&mdash;Klopp,
Barthold, Leo, and Gfrörer,
(who afterward became a Catholic,) fully
confirmed all that Hurter had advanced.
And now, within the past three
months we have a new historical work
on Gustavus Adolphus, from the pen of
another Protestant&mdash;Professor G. Droysen&mdash;an
eminent name in German literature&mdash;which
certainly appears to place
the question of motive on the part of
the king of Sweden beyond further controversy.
Professor Droysen's work
is written not so much as a biography
as with special reference to the political
necessities and ambition of the Swedish
king when he interfered in the German
struggle, and is written, also, mainly
with materials from the Swedish archives.
The result of Professor Droysen's
research is not only to more than
confirm the position assumed by Hurter,
but to leave no room for serious
discussion. Professor Droysen expressly
denies that the interference of
Gustavus Adolphus in the affairs of
Germany was in favor of the liberty of
conscience and religion, and he quite as
explicitly asserts that motives purely
political decided and even forced him to
put forward those pretexts.</p>

<p><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Monde et l'Homme Primitif selon

right reverend author expresses the
opinion that, in our day, one of the
causes of the weakening of faith in divine
revelation is certainly the false idea
formed of the Bible in connection with
the sciences. In this respect times
have greatly changed, and opinion has
passed from one extreme to the other.
Formerly, no important discovery was
made without seeking to confirm its
truth by Scripture testimony. The support
of a text, of a word, was then necessary,
even if they had to be slightly
wrested from their received acceptation.
Galileo undertook to prove his theory
by Bible texts badly interpreted. But
the contrary course now prevails to such
an extent that there exists almost an
affectation of contradicting the Scriptures.
The author takes up the six days
of the Mosaic account of the creation,
the six days being six indeterminate periods
of time&mdash;illustrating each day with
modern scientific views of the unity of
the human race, the primitive unity of
language, Chaldean and Egyptian chronology,

race the right reverend author insists
with some emphasis&mdash;as indeed he well
may, recognizing in it, as we all must, the
well-established doctrine of the Catholic
Church&mdash;and takes occasion to address
himself specially to Americans of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_707" id="Page_707">[707]</a></span>
United States on the subject of the man
of dusky hue. "Let us not forget," he
says, "that he is a child of the same
God, a descendant of Adam, having the
same faculties, the same soul, the same
heart; that the unity of the human
species has made him our equal, and
the Gospel our brother." The work
evidences great research and learning,
especially on the subject of the primitive
unity of language, where the author
shows entire familiarity with all
the results of modern treatise and investigation
from Bopp down to Ewald
and Delitsch.</p>

<p>We are aware that Bohemian and
Hungarian literature has but few attractions
for the very great majority of readers
in the United States. Nevertheless,
it may not be uninteresting to note
that in Bohemia, as in Hungary, there
exists a general awakening of interest
in their respective national literatures.
In both these countries many talented
authors are coming into notice, who
confine their literary labors to their mother
tongue. Palacky in Bohemia has
lately won high praise as a historian,
even in Germany and France. Besides
his <i>History of Bohemia</i>, he has lately
written several works on the historical
period of John Huss.</p>

<p>Of these the most important is
Palacky's <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Documenta mag. Joannis
Hus vitam, doctrinam, causam spectantia</i>.
Divided into four parts, the first
includes all the letters of Huss in Latin
and in Tcheck, the latter accompanied
by a Latin translation by Professor
Kviezala; the second part gives the
trial of Huss; the third, an account of
his trial and death by a contemporary,
Peter Mladenowicz; and the fourth, the
largest, all the documents relative to the
religious controversies of Bohemia from
1403 to 1418. In all cases the Tcheck
documents are accompanied by Latin
translations. While on the subject of
Bohemian literature, it may be well to
mention that the best general work upon
it is that of M. Hanusch,<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
late librarian
of the University of Prague. For the
bibliography of the literature, the most
complete work is that of Jungmann, written
in Tcheck. For literature proper, the
best is perhaps that of Sabina, which,
however, only comes down to the seventeenth
century. Sabina's work may
be said to be completed by that of M.

Professor Lipsius, of Kiel, is announced
as nearly ready for publication.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Volumes xiii. xiv. and xv. of the reprint
of the continuation of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire
Littéraire de France</i>, commenced
by the Benedictines, are lately published
by Palmé, Paris.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following important works are
announced as soon to appear: Volume
xviii. of the reprint of the <i>Annales Ecclesiastici</i>
of Cardinal Baronius, issued
under the direction of Father Theiner.
The first volume of a magnificent edition
of the Bible, printed at Rome, at
the expense of the Propaganda. This
edition reproduces textually, with a <i>fac-simile</i>,
the famous <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Codex Vaticanus</i>.
The present volume contains the Pentateuch
and the Book of Joshua. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_708" id="Page_708">[708]</a></span>
fifth volume, containing the New Testament,
was printed last year.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The work of Cardinal Jacobatius, entitled
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Concilio</i>, is also in press at
Rome, and will be printed as an introduction
to the great work forming a collection
of all the councils.</p>

<p>A decided success in historic literature
is the latest work on Calvin and
his times,<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
by F. W. Kampschulte, professor
of history at the University of
Bonn. The first of its three volumes
has appeared, and meets with almost
universal approbation. The author appears
to have spared no labor, and has
brought to light fresh and valuable authorities.
The manuscripts, mostly for
the first time used, far out-number the
printed works referred to. Heretofore,
the archives of Geneva have been considered
sufficient to furnish material
for a life of Calvin. But Professor
Kampschulte rightly judged that, in
view of the intimate connection between
Geneva and Berne during Calvin's
life, the archives of the latter city
must be rich in documents for his purpose.
A similar reason induced him to
visit Strasburg, and both places yielded
largely in fresh and important matter.
For Calvin's correspondence, previous
historians have contented themselves
with Beza's edition of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Epistolæ et
Responsa Calvini</i>, or with Bonnet's collection.
Professor Kampschulte, with
indefatigable research, has succeeded in
gathering a large number of Calvin's
letters, heretofore unpublished, which
he found scattered in every direction.
In this he was greatly aided by MM.
Reuss, Cunitz, and Baum, of Strasburg,
who for many years past have been
making a collection of the letters of
Calvin for a new edition of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Epistolæ</i>
in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Corpus Reformatorum</i>. With
a liberality deserving all praise, these
scholars generously placed all this valuable
material at Professor Kampschulte's
disposition.</p>

<p>Dr. J. B. Abbeloos, professor at the
Seminary of Mechlin, assisted by Canon
Lamy, professor of Oriental languages
at the University of Louvain, is preparing
for publication an important historical
and literary monument, of which
a small portion only has heretofore
been printed. It is the great Syriac
chronicle of Bar Hebreus, Primate of
the Oriental Jacobites. The first part
of this work was edited in 1788 at
Leipsic, by two well-known oriental
scholars, Brusis and Kirsch. The
second and third parts contain the
Ecclesiastical History, and present, as
to the beginnings of Christianity in the
East and on the history of the first four
ages of the church, a number of valuable
details not elsewhere to be found.
The distinguished Assemanni (Oriental
Bible, vol. ii. p. 312) says that the
ecclesiastical history of Bar Hebreus
admirably sets forth the religious history
of the Nestorians and of the Jacobites,
which is entirely unknown to the
Greeks and Latins.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ever since the period of the fatal and
futile attempt of certain unbelieving astronomers
to foist the Zodiac of Denderah
upon the Christian scientific
world, infidel and rationalistic writers
have never allowed an occasion to pass
to seek to elevate or praise old pagan
manners and systems of morality. The
more remote their field of disquisition,
the more positive are they. This attempted
rehabilitation of ancient systems
most remarkable for their profound
immorality is thoroughly defeated by
M. François Lenormant in his lately
published <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Manuel d'histoire Ancienne
de l'Orient</i>, 3 vols., <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">avec un atlas de
24 cartes</i>. His exposition of ancient
paganism is thorough and learned. M.
Lenormant's father was a co-laborer of
Champollion, and he has a European reputation
as an oriental scholar. The
work here announced was, in the form
of an essay, previously crowned by the
French Academy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The third and last volume of <i>Möhler's
History of the Church</i>, edited by
the Rev. Father Gams, has appeared
in Germany, and a French translation
of the same by the Abbé Belot at Paris.
Wherever it was practicable, F. Gams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_709" id="Page_709">[709]</a></span>
has filled voids left by Möhler with
review articles, written by Möhler on
the same subject. Möhler has given
special attention to the study of Protestantism,
and is convinced that the
"judgments passed on the condition
of the church during the century anterior
to the reform itself, greatly need
reforming." He refutes with great
force the erroneous opinions of men,
either ignorant of the past or willingly
blind, who have attributed to Luther
the honor of bringing the Bible to the
light of day. Nothing can be more
false. Immense works on the Bible were
produced during the middle ages, and,
rapidly following the discovery of printing,
numerous translations made their
appearance. From 1460 to the first
version of Luther in 1521 there were
printed in Germany at least sixteen
Bibles in High German and five in Low
German. Up to 1524, there were nine
editions in France, not counting those
of Italy, the first of which appeared in
1471.</p>

<h2>NEW PUBLICATIONS.</h2>


<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">The Roman Index and its late
Proceedings.</span> A Second Letter, etc.
By E. S. Ffoulkes. American edition.
Pott &amp; Amery.</p>

<p>After the publication of Mr. Ffoulkes's
letter, entitled, <i>The Church's Creed or
the Crown's Creed?</i> he was refused the
sacraments, as it was perfectly plain he
must be according to the certain rules
of moral theology by which priests are
guided. Archbishop Manning submitted
the letter to the examination of
four theologians, who, separately and
without mutual consultation, gave in
their opinion that it was heretical. The
archbishop, with the greatest delicacy
and kindness, began to treat with Mr.
Ffoulkes, for the purpose of inducing
him to make a sufficient retractation, in
order that he might repair the scandal
he had given and be restored to the enjoyment
of his privileges as a member
of the church. On the 22d of March,
1869, Mr. Ffoulkes submitted the following
letter to the archbishop:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Having learned from my bishop that a
pamphlet, lately published by me, entitled,
<i>The Church's Creed or the Crown's Creed?</i>
has been examined, and pronounced by him
to be heretical, I desire hereby to submit
myself to that judgment, and to express my
sorrow that I should in any thing have erred
from the Holy Catholic and Apostolic faith.
Although I trust I have not intentionally
erred from the truth, nor wilfully opposed
myself to the divine authority of the church,
nevertheless I am well aware how easily I
may have done so. I therefore hereby, without
reserve, retract all and every thing that
I have written, there or elsewhere, which is
contrary to what the church has defined as
of faith.</p>

<p>"Having learned also from him that scandal,
offence, and pain have been given by my
writings, and especially by the pamphlet
above named, to the faithful; and that the
same pamphlet has been used by those who
are separate from the Catholic and Roman
Church as an excuse or argument for not
submitting to its divine authority, I hereby
desire to explain myself categorically on
two points in particular, the most likely to
have caused such results of any that occurred
to me, from not having been brought
out as prominently there as they might have
been, but on which it never was my intention
that my meaning should be ambiguous.</p>

<p>"1. Whatever I may or may not have
been called upon to profess fourteen years
ago myself, I nevertheless believe, and believe
heartily, in the inerrancy, <em>by perpetual
assistance of the Holy Ghost in all ages</em>, of the
one Catholic Church in communion with the
pope, and of which the pope is head by divine
right, '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in fidei ac morum disciplinâ tradendâ</i>,'
as the Catechism of the Council of
Trent teaches. And 2, as regards matter of
fact, my own personal investigations enable
me to affirm the verdict of history to be,
that the see of Rome, as such, has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_710" id="Page_710">[710]</a></span>
preserved in all ages from upholding or embracing
heresy. <i>I say this more particularly
with reference to the doctrine of the procession of
the Holy Ghost, on which I fear my meaning
may have been misapprehended.</i> Therefore,
negatively, should I have ever seemed to
say or imply that the true church has ever
ceased to be one <em>visibly</em>, or that the see of
Rome was not constituted its centre of unity
upon earth, so that communion with the
one should be the indispensable condition
of participating in the unity of the other, I
hereby declare my heartfelt sorrow at having,
in any of my writings, so expressed
myself on these points as to have offended
any or misled any by seeming to say or imply,
<i>in language injurious to the Holy See</i>,
what I never meant to assert, and hereby repudiate.</p>

<p>"And as the best reparation now in my
power, I willingly undertake that this explicit
declaration of mine shall be printed
and distributed gratuitously by my publisher,
and appended as a fly-leaf to all copies
of my pamphlet, of which the copyright is
not in my own hands, and other published
works of mine that may hereafter be sold,
should it be desired. Lastly, I freely, and
from my heart, renew my assent to what
follows, taken from the profession of Pope
Pius IV.: 'I acknowledge the <i>Holy, Catholic,
Apostolic, Roman Church</i> for the mother and
mistress of all churches; and I promise true
obedience to the <i>Bishop of Rome</i>, successor
to St. Peter, Prince of the Apostles, and
Vicar of Jesus Christ.'" (Pages 37, 38.)</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 18th of December, 1868, a
work, entitled <i>Christendom's Divisions</i>,
by the same author, had been placed
on the Index, and, on the 26th of March,
the letter was placed there likewise.
The archbishop made some further suggestions
to Mr. Ffoulkes on the 2d of
May, which he accepted, and, on the 4th,
wrote to Mr. F., "I have received with
sincere pleasure the declaration as last
amended, and I trust it will complete
what I have daily prayed may be accomplished."
On the 17th of May, Mr. F.
wrote to a clergyman of the Church of
England, "<i>I would be excommunicated
a dozen times a day sooner than retract
my pamphlet</i>; and Archbishop Manning,
to his credit let it be said, never
proposed any such thing. What he
proposed, however, I rejected; and
substituted for it a declaration of my
own, <i>which is merely justificatory</i>.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
This, slightly altered, he has since accepted;
so that my part is over." This
letter was made known by the person
who received it, and came to the knowledge
of Archbishop Manning, who requested
Mr. F. to obtain the letter and
hand it over to him, a request which the
latter gentleman considered as insulting
to his "English feelings," and refused.
He himself writes to the archbishop,
and to the public also, (p. 43,) "Your
grace was apprehensive lest this loose
statement of a well-known tale-bearer,
duly reported to Rome, should give rise
to your being inhibited from accepting
my declaration. Though I thought this
extremely probable, I contented myself
with assuring your grace, by letter,
that, if the individual in question had reported
me to have said, 'I would rather
be excommunicated than retract, (<i>sic</i>,)'<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>
he had either misrepresented me wilfully,
or stated what was not the fact.
My English feelings would not allow me
to do more." The archbishop may certainly
be excused for not accepting this
statement, since the Anglican clergyman
had read the first paragraph of the
letter to the person designated, we hope
unjustly, as a "well-known busybody,"
and had communicated its contents to
several other persons "in strict confidence."
The archbishop had communicated
Mr. F.'s retractation or justification
to the Congregation of the Index,
and, on the 6th of August, a letter from
Mgr. Nardi to the archbishop was read
to Mr. F., in which his document was
pronounced insufficient, particularly because
not containing an expression of
submission to the decree of the sacred
congregation. A general form of
retractation of every thing which the
congregation had condemned in his writings,
and of submission to its judgment,
was sketched out for his guidance in
preparing a proper statement, and he
was informed that when such a declaration
had been sent to Rome and accepted,
no public notice would be taken of
it except to append to the censure in
the Index the words, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auctor laudabiliter
se subjecit</i>&mdash;the author has submitted in
a laudable manner. Mr. F. refused to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711">[711]</a></span>
make this submission, and was, accordingly,
notified by the archbishop that
he could not be admitted to the sacraments.
Mr. F. also notified his grace
that if any official sentence was pronounced
upon him, he should appeal to
the civil tribunal. At the conclusion of
his pamphlet he says, respecting the
"arbitrary sentence of a foreign court,"
"Please God, I shall live to contribute
my quota toward being the death of the
system from which it proceeds....
Please God, one of two things&mdash;for
which I shall continue to labor through
life&mdash;either that Christianity and Rome
may become convertible terms, which it
is my sincere wish that they should be;
or else that fresh halting-places for sober,
ordinary Christians, between Rome and
infidelity, maybe developed amongst us,
and new life be vouchsafed to those
which exist already." Finally says
Mr. F., in his last paragraph, "All we
of the west are lying under more than
one solemn anathema of more than one
pope, speaking as head of the church&mdash;if
popes have ever spoken as heads of
the church&mdash;for having changed a syllable
in the creed authorized by the Fourth
Council."</p>

<p>This is Mr. F.'s case. It is evident
that he became a member of the Catholic
Church under a great misapprehension
of her doctrine and law, and has
never been any thing more than an
Anglican. He is disposed to blame
those who received him; but it is plain
that they had no reason for suspecting
that his misconception of the obvious
meaning of the profession he made of
submission to the Roman Church was
so fundamental, and that he has only
his own confused state of mind to blame
for it. He has never really believed in
the ever-living, supreme, infallible authority
of the church, or had any other
principle than the Protestant one to
guide him. Hence, he has bewildered
and lost himself in a maze of historical
difficulties which he is unable to understand
or remove. His letters are the
most conclusive proof possible that the
bogus Catholicity of unionists is fit only
to complicate instead of solving the
controversies among Christians. It
shows the necessity of the most explicit
teaching of the principle of infallible
authority in all its practical applications,
and proves that it is only by
fully understanding and submitting to
the doctrinal supremacy of the Roman
pontiff as the vicar of Christ we can
have any sufficient and certain criterion
by which to distinguish genuine from
spurious Catholicity.</p>

<p>One other point remains to be noticed.
Mr. F.'s complaint that the sacred congregation
violated its own rule, by failing
to give him notice of the errors
in his writings and the opportunity of
explaining himself and making corrections.
This is a mistake on his part.
When erroneous statements are found
in the works of a Catholic author of high
repute for learning and orthodoxy, he
receives this notification, and, in any
case, when a book is placed on the Index
merely on account of some particular
errors, the phrase <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">donec corrigatur</i> is
added. Mr. F. is not an author of high
repute for learning and orthodoxy. His
writings are thoroughly unsound and
mischievous. There was no occasion
to cite him for a formal hearing or defence
of himself, since the whole question
was in reference to his writings,
which speak for themselves. The only
thing necessary for a judgment was an
examination of his books, and that they
were not hastily condemned is evident
from the fact that the censure was pronounced
three years after they were
published. M. Renan has just as much
reason to demand a hearing as Mr.
Ffoulkes.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Across America and Asia.</span> By Raphael
Pumpelly, Professor in Harvard
University, and sometime Mining
Engineer in the service of the
Chinese and Japanese Governments.
New York: Leypoldt &amp; Holt. 1870.</p>

<p>Mr. Pumpelly has given in this volume
an account, some parts of which
are interesting even to fascination, of
a five years' journey round the world,
by way of Arizona, California, Japan,
China, Tartary, and Siberia, whence he
returned across Europe and the Atlantic
to New York. His accounts of
what fell immediately under his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_712" id="Page_712">[712]</a></span>
observation during his travels are no
doubt accurate, and give an excellent
idea of the natural features of the regions
and people through which he
passed&mdash;particularly of the former; for
the author's profession and tastes made
him observe nature closely, and detect
and describe things which an ordinary
traveller would have left unnoticed.
His description of the plateau of Central
Asia is specially striking and valuable,
and the strictly scientific information
contained in this as in the other parts
of his work important; but he has, of
course, treated purely professional subjects
more fully elsewhere.</p>

<p>The work is interspersed with historical
sketches and political essays, some
of which perhaps are not without value;
but the egregious blunders made in the
account of the expulsion of Christianity
from Japan, on page 97, would lead one
to suspect that the author has not always
been duly careful in collecting his information.
He seems to profess to be
a Christian, as he speaks in one place
of "our Lord's sermon on the mount;"
but was evidently much impressed by
what he saw of Buddhism, from the
practices of which he wisely says that
"western ritualism, and much of the superstition
on which it is based," (p. 166,)
is derived. The same idea is brought
in on page 383. Other forms of heathenism
also impressed him favorably,
and he thinks well of the Mohammedans,
judging from what he says of
those at Kazan; but this admiration
for, and fascination by every thing except
the truth is not unusual among men
without faith.</p>

<p>He could not, of course, avoid noticing
the failure of Protestant missions, whose
converts he regards as hypocrites, influenced
solely by the hope of soup, and
frequently shows an appreciation of the
genius, devotedness, and success of Catholic
missionaries.</p>

<p>The author appears to be a man of
undaunted courage, great humanity, and
a high sense of both honor and morality.
His exposure of the villainous conduct
of white men toward the Indians in our
own country, and the dark races of
Asia, deserves our cordial thanks. His
remarks on the question of the effect
of Sclavonian advancement in the old
world and Chinese immigration in the
new, on the destinies of the coming age,
are fitted to awaken many deep and anxious
thoughts. The chapter on Japanese
art by Mr. John La Farge is worthy
of that accomplished artist. On
the whole, with the exceptions above
noted, this is one of the best books
which has appeared from the American
press.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">The Pope and the Council.</span> By
Janus. Authorized translation from
the German. Boston: Roberts Brothers.
1870.</p>

<p>This is not a book which can be reviewed
as to its contents in a critical
notice, or in any thing less than a volume.
It goes over the entire field of the relation
of the papacy to the church, considered
historically, and is a work of some
show of learning. We cannot, therefore,
touch on the question of its intrinsic
truth or falsity at present, but
simply on the point of its orthodoxy, as
judged by the criterion according to
which doctrine is to be judged by the
canons actually making the law of the
Catholic Church at the present moment.
According to this criterion, it is heretical,
and therefore to be rejected by every
Catholic, as much as Dr. Pusey's <i>Eirenicon</i>,
or Guettée's <i>Papacy Schismatic</i>.
The review of this last-named book in
<span class="smcap">The Catholic World</span> for July and
August, 1867, written by one of the
ablest of our contributors, will furnish
<i>ad interim</i> a sufficient refutation of the
anti-Catholic principles on which it
rests. We cite a few passages in proof
of the statement we have made. In the
preface it is stated that the book is "a
protest, based on history, against a menacing
future, against the programme
of a powerful coalition." This "programme"
means the whole preparatory
work of the body of theologians summoned
to Rome by the pope to prepare
for the council. Again, that "a great
and searching reformation of the church
is necessary and inevitable." Speaking
of those who follow the teaching of the
supreme pontiff in all things as their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_713" id="Page_713">[713]</a></span>
authoritative rule, the authors say,
"While in outward communion with
them, we are inwardly separated by a
great gulf from those," etc. "The papacy,
such as it has become, presents
the appearance of a disfiguring, sickly,
and choking excrescence on the organization
of the church, hindering and decomposing
the action of its vital powers,
and bringing manifold diseases in its
train." They say that there has been a
development "of the primacy into the
papacy, a transformation more than a development,
the consequences of which
have been the splitting up of the previously
united church into three great
ecclesiastical bodies, divided and at enmity
with each other." These extracts
prove the attitude of open rebellion
against the pontifical authority assumed
by the authors. The following shows
their utter defiance of the authority of
the Council of the Vatican:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"An &oelig;cumenical assembly of the church
can have no existence, properly speaking,
in presence of an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ordinarius ordinariorum</i>
(equivalent to bishop of bishops) and infallible
teacher of faith.... Bishops who
have been obliged to swear 'to maintain,
defend, increase, and advance the rights,
honors, privileges, and authority of their
lord the pope'&mdash;and every bishop takes this
oath&mdash;cannot regard themselves, or be regarded
by the Christian world, as free members
of a free council; natural justice and
equity require that. These men neither
will nor can be held responsible for decisions
or omissions which do not depend on them.</p>

<p>"With abundant reason were the two demands
urged throughout half Europe in the
sixteenth century, in the negotiations about
the council&mdash;first, that it should not be held
in Rome, or even in Italy; and, secondly,
that the bishops should be absolved from
their oath of obedience. The recently proclaimed
council is to be held not only in
Italy, but in Rome itself; and already has it
been announced that, as the sixth Lateran
council, it will adhere faithfully to the fifth.
That is quite enough&mdash;it means this, that
whatever course the synod may take, one
quality can never be predicated of it, namely,
that it has been a really free council.
Theologians and canonists declare that
without complete freedom the decisions of
a council are not binding, and the assembly
is only a pseudo-synod. Its decrees may
have to be corrected." (Pp. 343-345.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Such is the harsh, dissonant cry of
discord which interrupts the harmonious
accord of voices from all the world,
rising in responsive welcome to the
call of the vicar of Christ, summoning
together the whole church around
the tomb of the apostles. Naturally, it
gives great delight to the enemies of the
church, who see no hope for their cause
except in dissension among her own
rulers and members, and who welcome
these faithless Catholics, applaud them,
and disseminate their writings, as allies
of their own within our camp. Their
rejoicing, however, is premature. The
number banded together in this clique
is extremely small. Neither Mgr. Maret,
Mgr. Dupanloup, or the so-called
Liberal Catholics, represented by
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Correspondant</cite>, hold the extreme
opinions of <i>Janus</i>, which has been
placed on the Index in company with
Mr. Ffoulkes's productions. Gallicans
and liberals acknowledge the supreme
authority of the Council of the Vatican,
and will readily give up any private opinions
which may be condemned by its
judgment. Although the disciples of
Bossuet's school maintain that the papal
decretals do not become irreformible
until they have received the at least
tacit assent of the bishops, yet they admit
their binding and obligatory force
over all the faithful and over each
bishop, taken singly, as soon as legally
promulgated. All the pontifical decretals
which are proposed as dogmatic
judgments by the Roman Church have
received at least the tacit assent of the
bishops, and are, therefore, now irreformible,
even by a council, on Gallican
principles.</p>

<p><i>Janus</i> is in open rebellion against the
authority of these decretals, and against
the Council of the Vatican itself. The
persons concerned in its publication,
and all ecclesiastics who share their
sentiments, will be interdicted from all
exercise of sacerdotal functions in the
church, and excluded from her communion,
unless they retract their heresy
and submit to the authority of the council,
or else hide themselves under the
cloak of anonymous secrecy. The only
importance which <i>brochures</i> of this sort
have, comes from the supposed fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_714" id="Page_714">[714]</a></span>
their authors maintain a tenable position

are cut off from her communion, as they
certainly will be if they prove contumacious,
they mix with the great mass of
unbelievers, and are of no account. We
have had a succession of these traitors,
from Judas to Gavazzi, and it is quite
probable that the Council of the Vatican
will prove the occasion of a certain
number of apostasies. The departure
from her outward communion of those
who have already lost the faith is, however,
an advantage rather than an injury
to the church, and the places of these
deserters will be better filled by the
new converts who will be gained.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Life of Daniel Webster.</span> By
George Ticknor Curtis, one of his
literary executors. Volume I. New
York: D. Appleton &amp; Co., 90, 92,
and 94 Grand street. 1870.</p>

<p>Among the numerous regrets caused
by the death of Edward Everett, many
felt a disappointment because he had
not added to our literature and to his
own memoir of Mr. Webster a complete
biography of that distinguished statesman.
As far as we can judge from the
present volume of Mr. Curtis's work,
there is little cause, however, to regret
that the task of writing it should have
devolved on him. Its typography and
paper deserve special praise; while the
elegant yet modest appearance of the
book is in harmony with the dignity
of its subject, the style of the author,
and the taste of that portion of the
community who will constitute its most
attentive readers.</p>

<p>The story of Mr. Webster's rustic
boyhood, of the fireside legends of Indian
and British warfare, whence he
drew the patriotism of his riper years,
the history of his struggle with poverty,
and of the warm ties which
bound him to his elder brother, are all
told in a vividly interesting manner,
and will recall similar scenes to the
mind of many a reader. The successful
career at school and college of the
poorly-clad, sensitive lad, developing
gradually into his splendid manhood
and growing daily in the esteem of all
is also graphically portrayed. In his habits
of toil and deep study we see the
foundations of that solidity of character,
that grasp of intellect, which gave to his
eloquence its commanding force, and to
many of his forensic efforts their present
character of legal authority.</p>

<p>The rising generation will admire the
record of Mr. Webster's entrance into
public life, and the independence, integrity,
and loyalty which marked his
course therein. From his youth he
seemed to know of no other policy than
right. Though party lines are nowadays
more sharply defined than in his
time, we think this broad and true American
spirit is still the surest guide
to lasting political influence. And the
young politician who will place patriotism
and devotion to principle before
private ambition will secure the highest
triumph for both, and need never fear
the lash of party despotism.</p>

<p>In the present state of political affairs,
which proves in so many ways and on
so many points the correctness of Mr.
Webster's views, and the deep, far-seeing
genius of his statesmanship, we
heartily approve the moderation and historical
calmness with which Mr. Curtis
records the exciting scenes of the "nullification"
and "expunging" times, and
also Mr. Webster's views on the hushing
up of discussion on the abolition petitions
of '36 and '37.</p>

<p>We have evidences, in portions of his
correspondence brought into the work,
of the true place which Mr. Webster assigned
to principles, and of his contempt
for openly immoral men. Writing to
Mr. Ticknor in 1830, he says of a certain
eminent literary character, whose
sins have not been left to disappear
with his ashes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Many excellent reasons are given for his
being a bad husband, the sum of which is
that he was a very bad man. I confess, I was
rejoiced then, I am rejoiced now, that he was
driven out of England by public scorn; for
his vices were not in his passions, but in his
principles."</p></blockquote>

<p>On the whole, there are few biographies
of public men more healthful to
the moral system of the reader than that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_715" id="Page_715">[715]</a></span>
of Mr. Webster. We see his acknowledgment
of true principles, and if in
his private life he at any time afterward
lost sight of them, this weakness has not
the sanction of his genius, but stands
condemned by it.</p>

<p>As an orator, his natural powers rank
him with Demosthenes, with Chatham,
with O'Connell. The legal profession
will look upon him as one of its lights
and ornaments. And all who love America
will honor in him one whose heart
beat in unison with the mighty pulse of
this nation. We venture to hope that
the rest of the work will equal the present
volume, and that it will be read by
every intelligent young man in the United
States.</p>

Mommsen. Translated by the
Rev. W. P. Dickson, D.D. With a
preface by Dr. Leonhard Schmitz.
New edition, in four volumes. Vol. I.
New York: Charles Scribner &amp; Co.
1870.</p>

<p>This is a philosophical history. It is
difficult to do justice to the depth and
accuracy of the erudition it displays.
The style is also singularly happy&mdash;especially
for a translation. We accept
the author's facts, but not all his theories.
Some of the latter would account for
certain religious beliefs and practices
by ignoring, on the one hand, primitive
tradition, and attributing, on the other,
to peoples but just emerging from barbarism
the sublimest poesy and the keenest
wisdom. Rationalism will never succeed
in accounting for what was true in
the religions of Greece and Rome, any
more than for Christianity. The great
philosophical historian of our age is
Professor Leo, of Halle, whose account
of Rome is especially admirable. Those
who read German will probably find in
Leo and Mommsen, together with Niebuhr,
all they need to know of the principles,
constitution, origin, and historical
development of pagan Rome. For
a correct and condensed narrative of
events, Cantu's <i>Universal History</i> is

Against Nature.</span> By Horace
Bushnell. New York: Scribner &amp;
Co. 1869. 12mo, pp. 184.</p>

<p>We agree with Dr. Bushnell, as our
readers are aware, in opposing female
suffrage and eligibility as repugnant to
the law of God, the natural relations of
the sexes, and the interests of the family,
of society, and indeed of woman
herself; but in the course of his essay
he uses so many weak arguments, and
concedes so much to the women's
rights folks, that his conclusions, though
just, are not well sustained, and are not
likely to carry conviction to the minds
of those women who aspire to be men.
We do not believe the lot of woman in
society as it is can be truly said to be
harder than that of men. The curse of
our age is its femineity, its want of
manliness, its sentimentalism, and its
pruriency; and it could only be aggravated
by female suffrage and eligibility.
"The reigns of queens," said a queen
of France to a duchess of Burgundy,
"are conceded to be more successful
than those of kings." "True," responded
the duchess; "but it is because
queens follow the counsel of
men, and kings the counsel of women."
The age, or what is called the age, needs
reforming, we grant; for it has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_716" id="Page_716">[716]</a></span>
formed by Protestantism, which is simply
in principle a resuscitation of gentilism;
but not more for woman than
for man, and reformed it cannot be
without faith in the doctrine and obedience
to the commands of the church of
God.</p>

<p>The modern economical and industrial
system, which enriches the few at
the expense of the many, and which is
boasted as the grand achievement of
modern progress, is the source of most
of the evils which our political and social
reformers seek to redress. This
system, which sees in man only an
instrument of producing, distributing,
and consuming the material goods of
this life, and takes no account of the divine
sovereignty, or of man's moral and
spiritual wants, we are quite willing to
concede is a natural product of the Reformation.
It creates wants beyond its
power to satisfy, tastes and habits of
life which demand for their gratification
great wealth, and great wealth can
be the lot of only the few. It creates a
large class of men and women, especially
of women, for whom it does and
can make no provision, and who suffer
just in proportion to their cultivated and
refined habits and tastes. The system
is in fault, is based on the false principle
that the more wants you can stimulate
or develop in a man or a woman
the better. Hence, it creates a large
class who are ill at ease, misplaced, discontented,
and maddened by wants that
they cannot satisfy, and prepared to be
not reformers, but revolutionists.</p>

<p>There is no way of curing the evil,
which was as great in ancient Greece
and Rome as it is in modern Britain
or America, but by returning to the
Christian principle of self-denial, and
following the admonition of our Lord,
"Seek first the kingdom of God and
his justice, and all things shall be added
unto you." Would you make a man
happy, study not to increase his possessions,
but to diminish his desires.
While material riches are held up as
the supreme good, and poverty is
treated as a disgrace, if not as a crime,
there is no remedy for individual, domestic,
or social evils, as the history of
all heathen nations amply proves. Let
the poor be held in honor as our Lord
and his church held them, let voluntary
poverty for Christ's sake be counted
highly meritorious, and the evils our
radicals feel, and our women's rights
people complain of, will soon disappear,
and woman will find her proper place,
and man his. No political or social
revolution is needed; none will do any
good; all that is needed is to substitute
the Christian economy for the pagan
that now governs modern society.</p>

of every living Creature mentioned in
the Scriptures, from the Ape to the
Coral. By the Rev. J. G. Wood,
M.A., F.L.S., etc. New York: Charles
Scribner &amp; Co. 1870. Pp. 652.</p>

<p>This book merits unqualified praise.
It is so complete that it will probably
become the standard authority upon this
branch of biblical literature. Indeed, it
appears almost to exhaust the subject;
so that, although the work was written
more especially to aid biblical students,
yet the scientific exactness of Mr.
Wood's explanations and descriptions
will make the volume extremely valuable
to all who are interested in natural history.
The identification of the animals and
birds mentioned in Leviticus and Deuteronomy
is particularly useful. Many
of the words used in the ordinary translations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_717" id="Page_717">[717]</a></span>
do not really designate the creatures
that are intended. Mr. Wood
seems to have brought good sense and
great fairness to this difficult portion
of his task. Where he is unable to decide
with probability, he is not ashamed
to say that he "is lost in uncertainty,
and at the best can only offer conjectures."
But this uncertainty refers principally
to the smaller and less conspicuous
species. The larger animals and
birds are nearly all identified with tolerable
certainty. The illustrations of the
volume are numerous and finely executed.
They are mostly taken from living
animals, while the accessory details
have been obtained from Egyptian and
Assyrian monuments, and from the photographs
and drawings of modern travellers.
In every respect the book offers
a rich and varied treat to those
who feel an interest in knowing something
of the land and the people which
our divine Saviour chose for his own.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Art Thoughts</span>: The Experiences
and Observations of an American
Amateur in Europe. By James
Jackson Jarves. 12mo, pp. 379.
New York: Hurd &amp; Houghton.</p>

<p>Mr. Jarves is one of the few American
writers on art whose works are
worth reading and preserving. He
has devoted to the subject the study
and travel of many years, and has
gathered one of the finest collections of
genuine masters ever brought to this
country. To a certain extent, his verdict
upon painting and sculpture is entitled
to the greatest weight; for it is
founded upon intelligent study and a
natural artistic appreciation. For the
antique and the modern schools we may
cheerfully accept him as a guide; but
in the great realm of Christian art,
which lies glorious and beautiful between
these two extremes, he is but a
blind leader of the blind&mdash;a pagan of
the nineteenth century, unable to comprehend
true religious inspiration, or to
feel the artistic value of religious symbolism;
and for whom much of the sublimity
of the <i>Renaissance</i>, as well as the ruder
but sincere and often eloquent art of
the earlier Christian period, is therefore
covered with an impenetrable veil. It is
one of the canons of Mr. Jarves's criticism
that every species of asceticism,
either in life or in art, is a violation of
nature and of truth. That is false art,
therefore, which deals with representations
of physical suffering, and the
Apollo is a nobler subject than the crucified
Saviour. What a wealth of spiritual
beauty is shut out by this sensual
conception, we need not stop to say. It
is no wonder that, with such views, Mr.
Jarves, while he admires the enraptured
saints of Fra Angelico, cannot feel the
divine pathos and sublimity of Michael
Angelo's "Pieta." It is no wonder that
he believes that "every religion in the
form of a creed restricts and narrows
art;" that he hates the Roman Church
for its inculcation of the virtue of self-mortification;
denounces our worship
as rank idolatry of the most degrading
kind; and can hardly speak with decent
moderation his contempt for the
crucifix and his detestation of the uncomfortable
doctrine of eternal punishment.
To Catholics, indeed, almost
every page of his book conveys offence,
and the blasphemy of some passages is
too horrible for quotation.</p>

<p>The book is manufactured with due
regard to magnificence of exterior, and
many typographical niceties appropriate
to a work on the fine arts. There is so
much care, in fact, evident in its print
and binding that we have a right to
complain of there not being a little
more, and especially to protest against
the constant disfigurement of proper
names&mdash;partly through the fault of
the author, and partly through insufficient
proof-reading. "Giusti," for instance,
is printed "Guisti," "Giuliano"
appears as "Guliano" and "Giulano,"
never, we believe, in its proper form.
We have also "Guliana," and "Lucca"
<i>della Robbia</i> uniformly, instead of
"Luca." St. Simeon Stylites is called
sometimes "St. Stylus," (which is nonsense,)
and sometimes "St. Simone;"
and sometimes, we may add, "that
filthy fanatic." The union of Italian
forms of common Christian names, like
Simone and Francesco, with the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_718" id="Page_718">[718]</a></span>
prefix "St.," is another common
fault. For the words "King Ca<i>u</i>daules,"
"So<i>u</i>briquet," and "<i>Casa</i>" as the
Italian for "thing," we must hold the
proof-readers alone to blame.</p>

<p>This volume is by far the most original
and the best in every respect of
several excellent volumes by the reverend
author. The style and method of
treating the subject remind us of Archbishop
Manning. The discourses here
published were preached to overflowing
congregations, on the Sunday evenings
during the last Advent. They develop
a most important and interesting line of
argument, not frequently handled, but
likely to be most useful to the best class
of Protestants. They are intended to
show how those doctrines of the church
and sacraments which are distinctively
Catholic flow necessarily from the doctrines
of original justice, the fall, the
incarnation and redemption. They
address, therefore, directly, and in the
most conclusive manner, those Protestants
who are called orthodox or evangelical,
in common parlance. They cannot
be too strongly recommended to
those persons who believe in the true
divinity of Jesus Christ and seek to
know his doctrine and law. Pious Catholics,
also, will derive great instruction
and edification from this volume.
It is published in the neatest and most

vii. Part I. Council of Constance.
1869.</p>

<p>This part of the learned bishop's great
work is especially interesting at the
present moment, on account of the pretence
raised by a certain number of persons
that the Council of Constance was,
in all its sessions, &oelig;cumenical. It is,
besides this temporary interest, of lasting
and intrinsic importance, for reasons
well known to every scholar. Dr.
Hefele not only gives us a learned and
accurate historical work, but also a graphic
picture of the intensely exciting
and interesting events of the great
Council of Constance. We cite the author's
concluding sentence on the authority
of the decrees of the council:
"That (Eugenius IV.) intended to exclude
the decrees of Constance respecting
the superiority of general councils
over the pope from his approbation is
indubitable. In accordance with this,
and according to modern law, which declares
the papal approbation of general
councils necessary in order to make
them such, there can be no doubt that
(<i>a</i>) all the decrees of Constance, which
are not prejudicial to the papacy, are to
be considered &oelig;cumenical; on the other
hand, that (<i>b</i>) all which infringe against
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus</i>, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dignitas</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">præeminentia</i>
of the apostolic see, are to be considered
as reprobated." This is in harmony
with the sentiment of all the soundest
canonists and theologians, namely,
that which excludes the Council of Constance
from the number of the councils
strictly called &oelig;cumenical, and relegates
it to a second class of general councils<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_720" id="Page_720">[720]</a></span>

though rather mysterious, is still
most expressive and true. He shows
by nearly three hundred anecdotes that
children are really great mysteries and
little plagues. His fairy story of "Goody
Gracious! and the Forget-me-not" is
the very model of a fairy story&mdash;plenty
of imagination without going into the
impossible and improbable.</p>

<h2>CIVIL AND POLITICAL LIBERTY.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></h2>


<p>That evangelical romancer, M.
Merle d'Aubigné, not long since published
a discourse having for title,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jean Calvin, un des Fondateurs des
Libertés Modernes</i>, or "John Calvin,
one of the Founders of Modern Liberty."
The discourse, as the Abbé
Martin says, is of no importance; but
the title is significant. It claims for
the Genevan reformer the merit of being
one of the founders of liberty in
modern society. Mr. Bancroft in his
<i>History of the United States</i> does the
same. A Lutheran might with equal
truth claim as much for Luther, a
Scottish Presbyterian as much for
John Knox, and an Anglican as much
for Henry VIII. and the Virgin Queen
Elizabeth. Nearly all Protestant and
anti-Catholic writers assume, as an
indisputable maxim, that liberty was
born of the Reformation. All your
Protestant and liberal journals assert
it, and the ignorant multitude believe
it. Whoever contradicts it is denounced
as an ultramontanist, a tool of the
clergy, or a Jesuit, and, of course, is
silenced. Protestant nations enjoy,
even with many Catholics, the <i>prestige</i>
of being free nations; and all Catholic
nations are set down as despotic,
and, owing to the influence of
the church, as deadly hostile to every
kind of liberty, religious, political,
civil, and individual. Protestantism
and liberty, or Catholicity and despotism,
is adopted as the formula of
the convictions of this enlightened age.</p>

<p>This alleged connection of Protestantism
and liberty, and of Catholicity
and despotism, the Abbé Martin maintains,
is what gives to Protestant missions
in old Catholic nations the principal
part of their success in unmaking
Catholics. The Protestant missionaries,
seconded by all the liberal journals,
proclaim their Protestantism as
the liberator of nations, as that which
emancipates the people from political
despotism, and the mind from spiritual
thraldom. The great argument
used in this country against the church
is her alleged hostility to liberty, and
the certainty, if she once gained the
ascendency here, she would destroy
our free institutions, and reduce the
nation to political and spiritual slavery.
Such is the allegation; such the
argument.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_722" id="Page_722">[722]</a></span></p>
<p>Now, every man who knows anything
of history knows that the reverse
of what is here alleged is true.
The church has, undoubtedly, always
opposed lawlessness, and set her face
against revolutions for either king or
people; but she has never favored
slavery or despotism, and has always
favored that orderly liberty, the only
true liberty, which consists in the
reign of law, instead of passion, caprice,
or arbitrary will. She has always
and everywhere insisted that
the laws should be just and supreme,
alike for ruler and ruled. She has
sometimes submitted to despotic authority,
but she has never approved it,
or recognized it as legitimate; and
when a courtier monk preached before
Philip II. of Spain that the king is
absolute, and may do whatever he
wills, the Spanish Inquisition arraigned
him for his false doctrine, and compelled
him to retract it publicly from
the same pulpit from which he had
preached it.</p>

<p>The fact is, not that liberty was
born of or with the Reformation, but
that the Reformation itself was born
of absolute monarchy, despotism, or
Cæsarism, revived and confirmed at
the epoch of its birth. Prior to the
Reformation, which marked the triumph
of Cæsarism over feudalism,
there was, no doubt, much barbarism
in Christian Europe; but there was
no absolutism. A reminiscence of
Græco-Roman imperialism remained,
indeed, and was cherished by the civil
lawyers or legists, whose maxim
was, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quod placuit principi, legis habet
vigorem</i>; but absolutism never succeeded
in getting itself established.
The German emperors, especially the
Hohenstauffen, Cæsarists in principle
as well as in name, attempted to
revive the Roman empire, but did
not succeed. Power was divided.
There were free cities and <i>communes</i>
that governed themselves as veritable
republics under the guardianship,
nominal rather than real, of a suzerain.
The royal power was limited
by the great vassals of the crown, and
the authority of these in turn was limited
by the lesser nobles, by the estates,
and by the laws, and usages
which had the force of laws. What
characterizes the middle ages is the
spirit of liberty. Few men in our
time have better understood the middle
ages, save as to the action of the
church, than Sir Walter Scott, who, if
a romancer, was also something more
and better. He says in his <i>Anne of
Geierstein</i>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We may remind our readers that, in all
feudalized countries, (that is to say, in almost
all Europe during the middle ages,) an <i>ardent
spirit of liberty</i> pervaded the constitution;
and the only fault that could be found
was, that the privileges and freedom for
which the great vassals contended did not
sufficiently descend to the lower orders of
society, or extend protection to those most
likely to need it. The two first ranks in the
state, the nobles and the clergy, enjoyed
high and important privileges, and even the
third estate, or citizens, had this immunity in
peculiar, that no new duties, customs, or taxes
of any kind could be exacted from them
save by their own consent."</p></blockquote>

<p>The fault Sir Walter mentions was
not peculiar to the middle ages, and is
not less in European countries to-day
than it was then. The representatives
or delegates of the cities and
<i>communes</i> constituted the third estate,
and sat in the assembly of the
estates as early as the reign of Philip
the Fair. If the rural population
were not represented in the estates,
they were not forgotten. The church
had received that population as either
slaves or serfs. She had succeeded
in completely abolishing slavery in
all continental Europe before the fifteenth
century, and had made much
progress toward putting an end to
serfage. The enslaved populations
were emancipated in nearly all Catholic
Europe before the Reformation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_723" id="Page_723">[723]</a></span>
and in the early part of the seventeenth
century the French courts decided
that "a slave could not breathe
the air of France." The maxim of the
English courts was plagiarized from
the French judges. There may be a
question whether the European peasant
has gained much since the middle
ages; whether his increased wants
have not more than kept pace with
his increased means of supply; and
as for protection, they who most need
it never find it under any political <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i>.
The most cruel and heartless
landlords could not have been more
cruel and heartless than are your
cotton-mills and mammoth moneyed
corporations, especially when Mammon
was not exclusively worshipped.</p>

<p>But be all this as it may, this much
is certain: that during the feudal ages
there was, under the influence and
untiring exertions of the pope and
the monastic orders, a constant social
amelioration of society going on, and
the whole tendency of those marvellous
ages, so little understood, and so
foully belied, was toward the establishment
in every nation of a well-ordered
liberty, under the safeguard of
the church, and of Christian or Christianized
traditions and manners. The
fifteenth century came, and brought
with it not only the revival of pagan
literature, but of pagan politics, which
gave to the secular order a predominance
over the spiritual, as we have
explained in previous articles. The
unhappy residence of the popes at
Avignon, that "Babylonian captivity,"
as it has been called, and the great
schism of the west, which followed it,
in the fourteenth century, had served
much to diminish the splendor and
to weaken the political power of the
papacy. This, coupled with the secular
development of the age, and the
pagan revival, gave a chance for Cæsarism
to raise its head, and for the
sovereigns to declare themselves absolute,
and responsible to God alone
for their exercise of power. The feudal
constitution of Europe was crushed,
and the pagan empire took its
place. Not only the emperor and the
mightiest kings, but the pettiest sovereign
duke or count became a Cæsar
in his own dominions.</p>

<p>At this moment, just as Cæsarism
was on the point of winning the victory,
the Reformation broke out, not in behalf
of the old liberties, but to help abolish
them and secure to Cæsar his
triumph. So far from founding or
even aiding liberty, it interrupted its
progress, and gave the movement in
its favor, which had from the seventh
century been going on, a false and fatal
direction. The originators of the
Reformation may have been simply
heterodox theologians; but they could
not sustain themselves without the aid
of the princes, and that aid could be
obtained only by ministering to their
love of power, and submitting to their
supremacy alike in spirituals and
temporals. The princes that favored
the Reformation became each in his
own principality absolute prince and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pontifex maximus</i>. The prince protects
the reformers, and uses his civil
and military power to crush their enemies,
and to extirpate the old religion
from his dominions. Dependent on
him, and sustained only as upheld by
him, the Reformation was impotent
to restrain his arbitrary power. The
reformed religion, like gentilism, of
which it was in fact only a revival,
assumed at once the character of a
national religion; and the reformed
church was absorbed by the state, and
became one of its functions, an instrument
of police, which must always be
the fate of a national religion.</p>

<p>But the Protestant nations not only
helped on Cæsarism, which was the
spirit of the age, but they gave up or
were despoiled of their old liberties,
which they had long possessed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_724" id="Page_724">[724]</a></span>
enjoyed under the benign protection
of the church. England saw her parliament
practically annulled, and the
prince governing, under Henry VIII.,
his daughter Elizabeth, and the first
two Stuarts, as a Byzantine Basileus or
an oriental despot; and it cost her a
century of insurrections, revolutions,
and civil wars to recover some portion
of the political and civil freedom
of which the Reformation had despoiled
her. Even the Abbé Martin seems
to forget that from 1639 to 1746
England was in a state as unsettled
as France has been since 1789. She
has not even yet recovered all her old
liberties. She has, indeed, depressed
the crown to exalt the aristocracy of
birth or wealth, and is now entering
upon a fearful struggle between aristocracy
and democracy, most likely
to end either in reviving the pagan
republic, or in establishing once more
the absolute authority of the crown.</p>

<p>The author very justly maintains
that Protestantism has not created liberty,
and that it has arrested or falsified
it. He recalls that,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"At the breaking out of Protestantism
slavery had entirely disappeared, and serfage
or villenage, the transition state from
slavery to complete liberty, was gradually
disappearing, and giving place to free labor
and domestic servants. The third estate
was everywhere constituted, and nowhere
had it more life and vigor than in the neighborhood
of the churches and monasteries.
This emancipation was the work of the Catholic
Church, and never had a more signal
service been rendered to liberty. The basis
of all liberties, I say not of modern but of
Christian liberties, was laid.</p>

<p>"Impartial history testifies that Protestantism
has not accelerated this movement
in behalf of liberty, but has arrested it. A
few facts, gathered at random from the immense
number that might be adduced, will
sufficiently prove this assertion.</p>

<p>"'In Denmark,' says Berthold, 'the peasant
was reduced to serfage as a dog.' The
nobility profited by the reform, not only to
appropriate to themselves the greater part
of the goods of the church, but also the free
goods of the peasant.</p>

<p>"'The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corvées</i>,' says Allen, the best historian
of Denmark, 'were arbitrarily multiplied;
the peasants were treated as serfs. It happened
frequently that the children of the
preachers and sacristans themselves were
reduced to serfage. In 1804&mdash;mark the late
date&mdash;personal liberty was granted for the
first time to twenty thousand families of
serfs. Sweden and Norway fared no better.
In Mecklenburg, the oppression of the peasants,
who had no one to defend their rights
since they had lost the effective and vigilant
protection of the Catholic clergy, followed
immediately the triumph of the Reformation.
At the diet of 1607, they were declared simple
tenants at will&mdash;<i>colons</i>&mdash;who must yield
up to the landlords, on their demand, even the
lands which they had possessed from time
immemorial. Their personal liberty was
suppressed by the ordinances of 1633, 1648,
and 1654. They sought to escape from this
intolerable servitude by flight. The emigration
was large. But the severest punishments,
the lash, the carcan, even death,
could not arrest it, nor prevent the depopulation
of the fields. The lot of those miserable
creatures hardly differed from that of
negro slaves. The only difference was, that
the masters were prohibited from separating
families, and selling the members to the highest
bidder at public auction; but they eluded
it by trading off their serfs as horses and
cows. Serfage was abolished in Mecklenburg
only in 1820.</p>

<p>"The introduction of the Reform into
Pomerania gave birth there to all the horrors
of slavery. The ordinance of 1616 decreed
that all peasants are serfs without any
rights.... The ministers were required
to denounce the fugitive serf from the pulpit.
People are astonished to-day at the
emigration from Germany, which nearly
doubles that from Ireland. May not the cause
be found in that old state of things, which,
though recently abolished, has left but too
many traces of its existence?</p>

<p>"A single fact will enable us to judge
of the magnitude of the evil in Prussia.
Under Frederick II., the contemporary and
friend of Voltaire, who labored so energetically
to make of his infant kingdom an immense
barrack, the soldiers themselves, the
support and instrument of his power, when
discharged, returned to the common lot of
serfs, after having fought his battles and won
his victories. They were subjected anew to
their landlords; and not only they, but also
their wives, their widows, and their children,
even though born in a state of freedom....</p>

<p>"Calvinism has not produced so sad results
of the same kind. Less hierarchical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_725" id="Page_725">[725]</a></span>
in its nature than Lutheranism, and having
taken its rise in Geneva, a free state, it has
preserved something of its original constitution.
Thus it has prevailed generally in
countries organized under a republican form;
in France, even, it aspired to a federation.
But the liberty it has found, rather than created,
it turns into an odious tyranny. It has,
above all, no respect for individual liberty.
The system which Calvin established at Geneva
was even surpassed by that of John
Knox in Scotland. The ecclesiastical domination
over the faithful, and the inquisition
into all their doings, were frightful. Every
detail of private life could be brought before
the presbyterial <i>forum</i>; nobody could feel
himself safe. Espionage and domestic accusation
were the soul of the system. The
secrets of the family were scrutinized and inventoried;
and the terrible arm of excommunication
struck without relaxation and
without mercy. Woe to him who fell under
its blows; for him there was no social right.
Will it be believed? The Puritans of England,
who, to escape oppression and death,
free, and masters of a virgin territory, became
only the more rigorous, and their communities
in North America were even more
exclusive and tyrannical than those of their
brethren in Europe." (Pp. 326-330.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The author is too lenient toward
Calvinism. It had, indeed, no partiality
for monarchy, and just as little
for democracy. What it aimed at
was an aristocracy of the saints.
Only those in grace could be freemen
or exercise any authority in the
community. The church was composed
of the saints alone; and hence,
in the colony of Massachusetts, only
church members could be selectmen,
or magistrates, or vote in elections.
Church members had equal rights indeed;
but those who were not church
members had no rights at all, political,
civil, or individual, and no social
standing. The church members themselves
covenanted to watch over each
other, which meant, practically, that
every member was to act as a spy upon
every other member; and hence that
cautiousness in speech, that fear of a
<i>mouchard</i> in every neighbor, and that
obsequiousness to public opinion,
which marks not a few of the descendants
of the New England Puritans
even to this day. The rights of man
in relation to his brother man were undreamed
of, and for individual liberty
there was no respect whatever. The
individual was subject to the congregation,
ruled by the pastor and elders
or deacons, themselves ruled by two
or three venerable spinsters. Calvinism
sought, in fact, to govern society,
<i>minus</i> celibacy, as a monastery, by
converting the evangelical counsels
into inflexible laws, and without the
assistance of the grace of vocation.
We shall never forget the odious tyranny
to which Calvinism subjected
our own boyhood. Life for us was
stern, gloomy, hedged round with terror.
We did not dare listen to the joyous
song of a bird, nor to inhale the
fragrance of an opening flower. Whatever
gave pleasure was to be eschewed,
and the most innocent pleasures
were to be accounted deadly sins.
We cannot even now, in our old age,
think of our own Calvinistic childhood,
which was by no means exceptional,
without a shudder.</p>

<p>Thus far the author has spoken of
individual liberty, which is the most
essential of all, and without which
civil and political liberty is a vain
mockery. He asserts and proves, as
we have seen, that Protestantism has
not given to individual liberty a new
development, but has arrested it. Well,
was it more favorable to political liberty?
We have answered this question
already, but we cannot forbear
citing the author's own reply:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"At the epoch of the outbreak of Protestantism,
Christendom was advancing with
rapid strides toward the practice of the largest
liberty. For centuries the Italian republics
had pushed liberty almost to license.
They were, no doubt, often disorderly and
turbulent; but they were full of sap, overflowing
with life and activity, which availed
for Italy a power and a glory which she
seeks in vain from a factitious unity. Switzerland,
by the energy of her patriotism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_726" id="Page_726">[726]</a></span>
and the wisdom of her government, won the
admiration of the whole world. Flanders
and the northern provinces of Spain watched
with jealous susceptibility over their
proud and noble independence; England
had her <i>Magna Charta</i>, the basis of the
strong constitution which has given her security
in the midst of modern political and
social convulsions; the cities and <i>communes</i>
of France and Germany administered freely
their own affairs, as small republics under
the guardianship, often more nominal than
real, of some few suzerains. The guilds or
corporations of the mechanics and tradesmen
enjoyed rights the most extended.
Power was nowhere despotic, and, though
not restrained by scientific and uniform
rules, it encountered everywhere a counterpoise
to its authority and obstacles to its arbitrary
will. Christian monarchy, that creation
of the church, unknown in antiquity, approached
maturity, and there was room to
hope that it would found liberty without
opening the door to license, and without
having recourse to that enormous centralization
which has only too often become a
necessity. Catholic theology, always liberal,
in the true sense of the word, inclined
more to the rights of the people than to the
rights of the sovereign. It knew not yet
that right divine of kings as it was understood
under Louis XIV., a diminutive pagan
Cæsarism, which, as we shall show further
on, held more strictly than is commonly believed
from the principles which the Renaissance
and Protestantism caused to prevail."
(Pp. 330-332.)</p></blockquote>

<p>We remark here that the <i>Christian
monarchy</i> of which the learned abbé
speaks existed in the doctrines of the
theologians and in the efforts of the
church, rather than in the actual order.
There were Christian monarchs
or sovereigns, like St. Henry of Germany,
St. Ferdinand of Spain, and
St. Louis of France; but there was
nowhere, that we have been able
to discover, a <em>Christian</em> monarchy.
The feudal monarchy was of barbarian
origin, and was a development
of the chief of the tribe or clan. Side
by side with this, constantly struggling
with it for the mastership of society,
was Græco-Roman imperialism,
or briefly, Cæsarism, favored by the
whole body of the legists, and always
opposed by the church, though not
always by churchmen become statesmen
and courtiers. This pagan Cæsarism,
which concentrates in the
hands of the prince absolute authority
in both temporals and spirituals,
survived the fall of the Roman empire,
and never for a moment ceased
to struggle to recover the mastership;
and it was it that was in question in
the long struggle between the pope
and the emperor. Defeated in the
last of the Hohenstauffen, it revived
in every petty prince in Christendom.
It drove the popes from Rome into
the exile of Avignon, and caused the
great western schism. Still, the church
was for a time able to prevent its
complete success. But in 1453 came
the taking of Constantinople by the
Ottoman Turks, the dispersion of the
Greek scholars through the west; and
the revival of pagan politics and literature
served to reinforce Cæsarism,
to weaken the influence of the church,
and to give birth to the Protestant Reformation&mdash;at
bottom nothing more
nor less than a revival of the pagan
order, against which the church from
her birth had struggled.</p>

<p>The movement of which Protestantism
was one of the results dates from
a period before Luther, Melancthon,
and Calvin, from the revival in the
fifteenth century, and the successful
struggle of Cæsarism against feudalism
and the church. Protestantism
may have prevented the development
of a Christian monarchy; but it was
itself a child of Cæsarism. The movement
against feudalism, and for the
concentration of power in the hands
of the monarch, as well as for great
centralized states, preceded the birth
of Protestantism. Louis XI. in France,
Maximilian I. in Germany, Henry
VII. of England, the Cardinal Ximenes
in Spain, and the de' Medici in
Italy, all labored for the centralization
of power, and paved the way for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_727" id="Page_727">[727]</a></span>
the revival and triumph in their respective
countries of pagan Cæsarism.
The Abbé Martin's statements are
correct only in case we count Protestantism,
under its social and political
aspects, as the continuation and
development of the movement in behalf
of Cæsarism, or the centralization
of power, and against the liberties secured
by feudalism.</p>

<p>We are no admirers of feudalism;
but we hold it better than the Græco-Roman
imperialism it supplanted, or
the absolute monarchy which succeeded
it in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, of which Bossuet was a conspicuous
defender. The Reformation
aided the movement in behalf of
Cæsarism, by bringing to its support
an open rebellion against the papal
authority and the faith of the church,
and secured it the victory. Cæsarism
followed it immediately, not only
in the nations that accepted the new
religion, but also, to a great extent, in
the nations that remained Catholic.
On the first point the author asks:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Who does not know that Lutheranism
depended solely on the princes and nobles to
overcome and despoil the church, and to
triumph over the resistance of the people?
Through gratitude, and through necessity, it
surrendered itself and the people to the discretionary
authority of the princes. In all
countries where it became predominant, absolute
power prevailed.</p>

<p>"As the result of the revolution in 1661,
Frederic III. of Denmark and his successors
were declared absolute monarchs. The
royal law of 1665 attests that the king was
required to take no oath, was under no obligation
whatever; but had plenary authority
to do whatever he pleased. In Sweden, the
violent and surreptitious establishment of
Protestantism was done in the interest of
royalty and nobility, and, moreover, raised
up an antagonism between these two powers
which produced a series of revolutions
in that country unrivalled in any other
European state. But royalty finally triumphed.
The estates, in 1680, declared that
the king is bound to no form of government.
In 1682, they declared it an absurdity to pretend
that he was bound by statutes and ordinances
to consult, before acting, the estates;
whence it follows that the will of the
king was the supreme law. 'After that,'
says Geijer, the classic historian of Sweden,
'all was interpreted to the advantage of
the omnipotence of one alone. The estates
were no longer called the estates of the
realm, but the estates of his majesty. In
1693, the unlimited absolutism of royalty became
the law; the king was free to govern
according to his good pleasure, without any
responsibility.'</p>

<p>"It would be too long to follow the introduction
of the same <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i> as the consequence
of the Reformation into the several
states and principalities of Germany, in
Mecklenburg, Pomerania, the duchies of
Hanover and Brunswick, Brandenburg and
Saxony. Everywhere the introduction of
the new religion was followed by an augmentation
of the power of the prince and nobles,
and everywhere the prince finally succeeded
in absorbing the power of the nobility.
Prussia affords us a striking example of this
result. Under the reign of the Elector
Frederick William, from 1640 to 1688, the
arbitrary and absolute power of the prince
was developed according to a regular plan.
The General Diet after 1665 ceased to be
convoked. Crushing taxes were imposed
without the consent and against the protests
of the estates, and collected by the
military; and so heavy were they, that multitudes
of peasants, despoiled of their goods,
were driven to brigandage for a living. A
great number sought refuge in Poland, and
nobles even deserted a country that devoured
their children. Lands which were taxed
beyond the value of their produce were
abandoned, and suffered to run to waste.
The country was oppressed by an unprecedented
tyranny. Prussia, according to the
expression of Stenzel, was in the way of
becoming one of those Asiatic countries in
which despotism stifles the growth of whatever
is beautiful or noble." (Pp. 332-334.)</p></blockquote>

<p>We have already spoken of the
effects of the introduction of Protestantism
into England and Scotland.
Calvinism, the author considers, caused
less grave and less durable damage
to liberty; yet it was not less tyrannical
by nature, only it was less monarchical.
"At Geneva it confiscated
all the ancient franchises to the profit
of the oligarchy it established, and it
was not owing to it that in Holland
the stadtholder did not become absolute."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_728" id="Page_728">[728]</a></span>
Protestant historians are perfectly
well aware of these facts, and from
time to time they concede them; and
yet the best of them continue to assert
the impudent falsehood, that Protestantism
has created and sustained
modern liberty, individual, civil, and
political&mdash;not, indeed, because it has
done so, but because they think it
would have been much in its favor if
it had.</p>

<p>The other point, that Protestantism
is in great measure responsible for
the establishment or partial establishment
of the pagan monarchy, or Cæsarism,
in Catholic nations, we have
shown in our previous articles on the
work before us; yet we cite the following
from the author:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is not simply in countries in which
it triumphed that the Protestant Reformation
has given to liberty a retrograde movement;
it has reacted in a most fatal, though
generally in an imperceptible, manner on
Catholic governments themselves. It was,
at its first appearance, a terrible temptation
to the princes and sovereigns of Europe. It
broke that firm independence of the Catholic
clergy which had for so many ages repressed
the tyrannical aspirations of secular governments;
it gave up the rich spoils of the
church to them, reversed their parts, and
after having placed the priest, the representative
of heaven, at the mercy of the powers
of earth, it constituted the prince the master
and director of consciences. What could be
more seductive? An obstacle to overcome,
almost a yoke to break, independence to
conquer, vast riches to appropriate, the empire
of souls to place by the side of the empire
of bodies, the ideal of a power veritably
sovereign; is it not the dream of every man
who feels himself at the head of a nation?
Princes and sovereigns yielded to the temptation.
They were, besides, already prepared
for it, by the received theories of legists
or civil lawyers, inherited from the
pagan state; by the ideas propagated by the
Renaissance and by the Machiavelian lessons
then taught in all the courts of Europe; and
if all did not accept Protestantism, it was far
less due to their personal repulsion than to
the decided opposition of their people. But
the new ideal of power germinated in their
minds. On the other hand, the church,
weakened and her very existence threatened,
saw herself reduced to the necessity of
relying on them for support against the
armed violence of the Reformation. She
must purchase their protection, and could
do it only at the expense of her independence.
In various places she abandoned to
them the nomination of bishops and the
collation of benefices, giving by this sacrifice,
rigorously exacted by circumstances,
and by this abandonment of her rights, which
afterward proved so fatal, a sufficient satisfaction
for the moment to the secret reason
which inclined them to Protestantism. She
loosened a prey to them, in order not to be
devoured herself. Their hunger thus appeased,
they consented to sustain her, but
without having a common cause with her.</p>

<p>"Profiting adroitly by their position, the
sovereigns passed rapidly from the part of
defenders of the church to that of guardians
and masters, and while respecting the essence
of the spiritual power, they labored to
subordinate the church and the exercise
of her authority to the surveillance of the
state. Not content with excluding all control
of the church over their own acts, all
interventions of the spiritual authority in
civil and political affairs, they sought, after
the example of the Protestant princes, to
penetrate the interior of the church, and
make themselves pontiffs; and if we cannot
say that they completely succeeded, we cannot
any more say that they wholly failed.
What is certain is, that thenceforward they
ceased to find any serious obstacle in the
Catholic clergy or their chief to their designs,
and that the legists, imbued with the
maxims of the Roman law, and for a long
time hostile to the church, coming to their
aid, absolute royalty, without much difficulty,
prevailed. The indirect influence of
Protestantism was there.</p>

<p>"Even the Catholic clergy themselves
contributed to this fatal evolution. Whether
moved by gratitude, by a monarchical impulse,
or, in fine, by necessity, they accepted,
at least in the civil and political order,
the new pretensions, and acknowledged the
new rights of those sovereigns who, in espousing
the Catholic religion, had saved it
from the greatest danger it had as yet run.
Influenced by the tendency of the times,
Catholic theologians, especially in France,
deserted the highways of the political theology
of the middle ages, and proclaimed not
only the divine origin of power, but the divine
right of the king, his dependence on God
alone, and the passive obedience of the people.
The idea of the Christian monarchy
was perverted, and in Catholic as in Protestant
countries it inclined to Cæsarism.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_729" id="Page_729">[729]</a></span>
The church was the principal victim of this
political transformation; she was all but
smothered in the cruel embraces of Catholic
monarchs, when God himself delivered
her by the blow which was intended to extinguish
her&mdash;the French Revolution. When
that revolution broke out, the work of the Renaissance
and of the Reform seemed accomplished.
Except in England, Holland, and
some microscopic Swiss republics, Catholic
for the most part, absolutism reigned everywhere.
Is it not, then, the strangest falsification
of history to attribute to Protestantism
the initiation of modern liberty?" (Pp.
339-341.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Unhappily, Protestants will pay little
heed to the fact that the loss of
liberty in Catholic nations was due
either to Protestantism or to the movement
of which Protestantism was simply
a development. There can be no
reasonable doubt that but for Protestantism
the church would have
been able to check and roll back the
powerful movement for the revival of
Cæsarism, which had commenced in
the fifteenth century, and have prevented
the growth of absolute monarchy
in a single Catholic state. The
Protestant rebellion so weakened her
external power, and detached from
her so large a portion of the populations
of Europe, that she was no
longer able to restrain the absolutist
tendencies of all European sovereigns.
The sovereigns themselves, almost
without exception, were inclined to
the movement&mdash;were, in fact, its chief
supporters; and if they did not all
join it, it was because they were held
back by their people, whose faith in
the old religion was too strong to be
given up at the pleasure of their
princes, not because they had personally
any devotion or attachment
to her faith. The French court and
most of the higher French nobility
openly or secretly favored Protestantism
till the conversion of Henry IV.;
and even that monarch had formed
a league with the Protestant princes,
and was preparing for a war against
the Catholic powers of Europe, at the
very moment he was assassinated.
His policy was adopted and carried
out under his successors by Cardinals
Richelieu and Mazarin, who repressed
Protestantism in the interior, but
supported it everywhere else. That
France remained Catholic, was owing
to the concessions made by the pope
to her sovereigns, and to the firmness
of the French people under the lead
of the noble Guises, so calumniated
by almost all modern French writers.</p>

<p>Yet the abbé expresses himself too
strongly. The triumph of absolutism
was never so complete in Catholic as
in Protestant nations. In Protestant
nations, the sovereigns united both
the political and the spiritual powers,
as under Greek and Roman gentilism,
absorbed the church, and made
religion a function of the state. In
Catholic nations, although royalty interfered
beyond measure in ecclesiastical
affairs, the two powers remained
distinct, and the church retained, at
least in principle, her autonomy, however
circumscribed and circumvented
in its exercise. This is evident from
the concordats she conceded to the
sovereigns, and the diplomatic relations
of Catholic powers with the holy
see. Throughout all her humiliations,
the church asserted and maintained,
in principle, her independence. In
all Protestant countries, the state legislated
for the Protestant church; it
nowhere treated with it as a separate
power, and held, and could hold, no
diplomatic relations with it. In all
Protestant nations, the church became
national and local; but in all Catholic
nations she continued to be Catholic,
and was always and everywhere some
restraint on the absolute power of
the sovereign, as both Louis XIV.
and Napoleon I. learned by experience,
and hence their discreditable
quarrels with the holy see, and the
imprisonment of the holy father by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_730" id="Page_730">[730]</a></span>
the latter. Lord Molesworth remarked
in 1792, as cited by the author from
Döllinger's <i>Church and Churches</i>, that,
"in the Roman Catholic religion, with
the supreme head of the church at
Rome, there is a principle of opposition
to unlimited political power. It
is not the same with the Lutheran
[he might have added the Anglican]
clergy, who depend on the crown as
their spiritual and temporal superior."
This principle opposes the unlimited
power of the people no less than of
the monarch, and hence the sects all
agree, now that the age tends to democratic
absolutism, in opposing the
church in the name of the people;
for Protestantism has the same absolutist
instincts always and everywhere.</p>

<p>The author, we think, exaggerates
the adoption by the Catholic clergy,
even in France, of absolutism in politics.
Bossuet, who was a French courtier
as well as a Catholic bishop, as
tutor to the dauphin, went, no doubt,
as far in asserting the divine right of
kings, and passive obedience, as the
Anglican divines under the Stuarts;
and some of the clergy, yielding to
court influence and the spirit of the
age, followed him; but the noble
Fénélon, in no respect his inferior as
a theologian, differed from him, held,
with the great body of Catholic theologians
in all ages, that power is a
trust for the public good, and that
kings are responsible to the nation
for their exercise of it. It was his
anti-absolutist doctrine, not his few
inaccurate expressions on the doctrine
of pure love, in his <i>Maxims of the
Saints</i>, that caused him to be stripped
of his charges at court, and exiled to
his diocese of Cambray. Nor is it true,
as the abbé insinuates, that the pope
sanctioned the absolutist doctrines
which prevailed in France or elsewhere
in the seventeenth century.
The four articles, dictated by the government,
slightly modified by Bossuet,
and accepted by a small minority
of the French bishops, which contain
the very essence of absolutism, were
no sooner published by order of the
king, and commanded to be taught
in all the theological seminaries, and
to be conformed to by all the professors
and clergy of the realm, than
the pope condemned them, annulled
the order of the king, and finally
compelled him to withdraw it, or at
least to pledge himself that he would
do so. The pope never failed to assert,
and, as far as he could, to cause
to be respected, the rights of the
church&mdash;that is to say, the rights of
God, which are the only solid basis
of the rights of man.</p>

<p>Every theologian knows that, prior
to the rise of Protestantism, and even
for a considerable time afterward, Catholic
political theology bears no trace
of the absolutism taught by Bossuet,
and which he had borrowed from contemporary
Protestantism. It is worthy
of remark that nowhere were the
first acts of the French Revolution
hailed with more joy than at Rome
with the pope and cardinals, and it
found no warmer, firmer, or more disinterested
supporters than the French
clergy as a body, whose representatives
were the first to join the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tiers-Etats</i>.
Afterward, when the revolution
run into horrible excesses, put
forth doctrines subversive of all religion,
and even of society itself, assumed
the right to legislate on spiritual
matters, and showed that it only
transferred absolutism from the king
to the mob, there was undoubtedly a
reaction against it in the minds of the
pope and clergy, as there was in the
minds of all men not incapable of
profiting by experience, and who
could not prefer license to orderly liberty.
The salvation of religion and
society made it the duty of the church
to sustain with all her power the sovereigns
in their efforts to repress the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_731" id="Page_731">[731]</a></span>
revolutionary spirit, and to restore and
maintain social peace and order.</p>

<p>It is this fact, stripped of its reasons,
and its real nature misunderstood or
misrepresented, that has given rise to
the pretence that the church opposes,
while Protestantism, which is leagued,
if not identical, with the revolution,
favors liberty. Protestants never, that
we are aware, put forth any pretence
of the sort prior to 1792. Up to
the moment of this reaction against
the French revolution, the contrary
charge had been made, and the church
condemned for being hostile to the
rights of sovereigns, and it was in reply
to the speech of Cardinal Duperron,
in the states-general in France
in 1614, in favor of the rights of the
nation and the church against the irresponsibility
of the crown, that James
I. of England wrote his <i>Remonstrance
for the Divine Right of Kings</i>. History
as written by Protestants is composed
of disjointed facts, misplaced
and misrepresented, whenever it is not
pure invention.</p>

<p>The author is not quite exact in
saying absolutism reigned everywhere
at the breaking out of the French
revolution, except in England, Holland,
and the Swiss cantons. The
United States had won their independence
and adopted their federal
constitution before that event, and
certainly the American republic was
not founded on the principle of the
omnipotence of the state or of the
people. It revived neither pagan
imperialism nor pagan republicanism,
and was in its fundamental principles
more nearly a Christian republic than
the world had hitherto seen.</p>

<p>It would seem, as the great mass of
the American people were Protestants,
and the more influential portion of
them intensely Protestant, of the Calvinistic
type, that the American republic
should be held as an exception
to the assertion that Protestantism
resulted everywhere in the establishment
of absolutism. But it is in reality
no exception. It had no existence
at the epoch of the Reformation,
and Protestantism had no hand
in founding it. It was founded by
Providence, and the principles which
form its basis were derived by the
English colonists, not from Protestantism,
but from the old constitution
of England in Catholic times, and
which, though suppressed by the ruling
classes, never ceased to live in
the traditions of the English people.
The revolution in the seventeenth
century in England was the struggle
of the English people to recover their
old rights, of which Protestant royalty
and nobility had deprived them. Royalty
and nobility did not emigrate;
they remained at home, and there
were in the Anglo-American colonies
no materials from which either could
be constructed. The great principle
of the Puritans, that the church is independent
of the state and superior
to it, or that the state has no authority
to legislate in religious matters, not
even in non-essentials, was a Catholic
principle, for which the popes, in
their long struggles with the secular
power, had uniformly contended. It
is the vital principle of liberty; for it
interposes the rights of God, represented
by the church, as the limits of
the rights of the state. The Puritans
had asserted this principle in their
own defence against the Protestant
king and parliament of England, which
assumed plenary authority in spirituals
as well as in temporals. It was
not Protestantism that developed this
great principle of all just liberty, and
opposed to all absolutism; it was the
old Catholic principle, always and
everywhere asserted by the Catholic
Church.</p>

<p>But taking the Bible, especially the
Old Testament, interpreted by a fallible
authority, as their criterion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_732" id="Page_732">[732]</a></span>
rights of God, as represented by their
Puritan church, the Puritans failed
not in asserting, but in applying the
principle, and established, in practice,
as we have seen, a most odious tyranny.
They misapplied the principle,
which can be rightly applied only by
the Catholic Church. Their Protestantism
misled them, and perverted
the truth they retained, as was universally
the case with Calvinists. It is
easy to see now why Protestantism
deserves no credit for founding American
liberty. It was not of Protestant
origin, and we may add Protestantism
is busy at work to destroy it,
or at least shows itself impotent to
sustain it.</p>

<p>The true basis of American liberty
is in the assertion of the rights of
God, represented by the church, or by
religion, as bounding or limiting the
power of the state, whether imperial
or popular. But under Protestant influences,
the rights of God are resolved
into the rights of man, and the
Christian republic becomes simply a
humanitarian republic, which can offer
no solid foundation for liberty of
any sort. The rights of man are no
more sacred and inviolable than the
rights of the prince or the state. It
is only when the rights of man are
resolved into the rights of God in
and over man, that they are sacred
and inviolable, or inalienable. But
the American people have ceased so
to resolve them, if, indeed, they ever
did it, and recognize no more ultimate
basis for liberty than humanity itself.
If, as many of them do, they insist
on religion as necessary to the maintenance
of liberty, it is only as an
external prop or support, not as its
logical basis, or root, out of which it
grows, and from which it derives all
its sap and vigor.</p>

<p>No humanitarian republic is or can
be a free republic, because, though it
recognizes the people as the state, and
establishes universal suffrage and eligibility,
it has nothing but humanity,
nothing above the people, to limit or
restrict their power as the state. The
people are humanity in the concrete,
and a humanitarian republic therefore
simply transfers the absolutism from
the monarch to the people, and substitutes
democratic Cæsarism for monarchical
Cæsarism, the pagan republic
for the pagan empire. Absolutism
is absolutism, whether predicated
of the one or of the many. We in
the United States are rapidly losing
sight of the Catholic principle retained
by the Puritans, and rushing into
democratic absolutism; we assert the
omnipotence of the will of the people,
and treat constitutions as simply
self-imposed restrictions, which bind
no longer than the people will. Demagogues,
politicians, and statesmen
tell the people that their will is supreme;
and vainly would he seek their
suffrages who should deny it. The
opposition to the extension of the
church in this country grows precisely
out of the well-known fact, that
she does not emanate from the people,
is not subject to the will of the
people, and would restrict their omnipotence&mdash;an
opposition that proves
that she, not Protestantism, is the defender
of liberty. Certainly, if she were
to become predominant here, she
would soon put an end to the absolutism
of the state, sustained by all
our leading journals, and reëstablish
the Christian republic, in place of the
humanitarian or pagan republic, to
which we are pushed by the Protestant
spirit of the age, the veritable
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Welt-Geist</i>, or prince of this world,
as all Protestant movements amply
prove.</p>

<p>The abbé shows a strict alliance
between contemporary Protestantism
and the revolution, or revolutionary
movements in all European nations.
With these revolutionary movements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_733" id="Page_733">[733]</a></span>
we have the authority of the chief
magistrate of the Union for saying the
American people generally sympathize.
We lend, at least, all our moral
support to these movements wherever
we see them. They owe their origin,
in fact, to Protestantism; and, so
far at least as they are confined to
Catholic nations, are fomented and
encouraged by Protestant emissaries
and Protestant associations and contributions;
yet these movements are,
under the name of liberty, purely humanitarian,
and their success would
simply substitute the absolutism of
the people for the absolutism of the
monarch&mdash;democratic Cæsarism, or
rather, demagogic Cæsarism, for imperial
Cæsarism. In the sixteenth
century, the sovereigns embraced or
inclined to the Reformation, because
it removed the restraints that the
church imposed on their absolute power
and arbitrary will; demagogues
and revolutionists in the nineteenth
century glorify it, because it removes
all restrictions on the will of the people
as the state. In each case the
church is opposed to it, and for the
same reason, because she asserts the
rights of God as the basis of the rights
of man; and, as their divinely constituted
guardian and representative,
interposes them as a limit to the absolute
power of the state, whether
monarchical or democratic, the only
security possible for the reign of justice,
of just laws, and therefore of real
liberty, individual, civil, and political.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that Protestantism,
since the culmination of monarchical
absolutism in the seventeenth
century, has agitated for the revival
of what it calls liberty, but what we
call the humanitarian or pagan republic.
The people moved by it have,
no doubt, supposed they were marching
toward real liberty; but they have
nowhere gained it, and have only
removed the day of its acquisition.
Under its influence we have smothered
the principle of liberty, and lost
most of the guarantees which Providence
gave us in the outset. We
have lost not only the principle of
liberty, but also its correlative, the
principle of authority; and have no
basis for either freedom or government,
for the basis of neither can be
found in humanity. Great Britain, to
a certain extent, has popularized her
administration; but through all her
changes of dynasties and constitutions,
she has never ceased to assert
the omnipotence of the state as the
state, supreme in spirituals as in temporals.
On the continent, the revolution,
attempted in the name of humanity,
has nowhere founded liberty.
Its momentary success in France
from 1792 to 1795, inclusive, is universally
recognized as the Reign of
Terror, when religion was suppressed
and virtue was punished as a crime.
France, after a century of revolutions,
is not as free to-day as she was even
under her old monarchical institutions.
The French are just now trying anew
the experiment of parliamentary government
which the Anglo-maniacs
consider only as another name for
liberty; but whether the experiment
succeeds or fails, liberty will gain nothing;
for the parliamentary government
is as absolute as the personal
government of Napoleon III., and
most likely will have even less regard
for the rights of God. The one no
more than the other will recognize the
spiritual power as a restriction on the
power of the temporal.</p>

<p>In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries,
the spirit of the age was for the
revival of pagan imperialism; the spirit
of the age is now, and has been
since the middle of the last century,
the pagan republic; but there is just
as little liberty under the one as under
the other, or, if any difference,
there is less under pagan republicanism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_734" id="Page_734">[734]</a></span>
than under pagan imperialism;
for the Roman empire was really an
improvement on the Roman republic.
Under the one the monarch is the
state; under the other the people or
the ruling classes are the state; and
under both the state is alike supreme,
and acknowledges no limit to its
power. The republican party is now,
here and in all Europe, as hostile to
the church as were the sovereigns in
the sixteenth century, and for the
same reason. The party knows perfectly
well that it is impossible for her
to approve any form of absolutism in
the state. Having decided that the
humanitarian republic it seeks to
establish, and to which the spirit of
the age tends, is liberty, it holds, and
public opinion sustains it, that its success
depends on sweeping her away,
and destroying all religion that does
not emanate from the people, or that
claims to be a power independent of
the state, and authorized to declare
the law for the people instead of receiving
it from them. Because she
resists the madmen of this party, and
seeks to save herself and society, they
denounce her as opposed to liberty,
as the upholder of despots and despotism,
as at war with the spirit of
the age, and the bitter enemy of modern
civilization. "If," said the accusers
of our Lord to the Roman procurator,
"thou lettest this man go,
thou art not Cæsar's friend." "If,"
said the reformers in the sixteenth
century, "thou sparest the pope or
the church, thou art no friend, but a
traitor to the king;" "if," say their
children in this nineteenth century,
"thou upholdest the church, thou art
no friend, but a traitor to the sovereign
people, and false to liberty;"
and the nineteenth century believeth
them. We disbelieve them, and believe
the Lord, who hath bought us
with his own precious blood and made
us free.</p>

<p>These madmen are animated and
carried away by the spirit of the age,
and suppose all the time that they are
battling for liberty against its most
dangerous enemies. They carry the
people with them, and induce them
to crucify their God as a malefactor.
What is to restrain them? The strong
arm of power? That were only to
establish the reign of force. Reason?
What can reason do with madmen, or
against the multitude blinded by false
lights and moved onward by an unreasoning
passion? The intelligence
of the age? Are they not carried
away by the age, and is it not from
the very madness of the age that they
need to be saved? When the very
light in the age is darkness, how great
must be its darkness! It is only a
power that draws its light from a
source of light above the light of the
age, and acts with a wisdom and
strength that is above the people,
above the world, that can restrain
them and convert them into freemen.</p>

<p>If there is any truth in history, or
any reliance to be placed on the inductions
of reason, the author has amply
proved, in opposition to the pretensions
of Protestants and revolutionists,
that society under the direction
and influences of the Catholic Church
marches steadily toward a true and
regular liberty&mdash;a liberty which is
grounded in the rights of God, and
therefore secures the rights of man.
He has also proved conclusively, as experience
itself proves, that just in proportion
as the influence of the church in
society is weakened, liberty disappears,
and absolutism, either of king or people,
advances. He has shown that
the Reformation, instead of founding
or aiding liberty, has interrupted it,
and prevented the development of the
germs of free institutions deposited
in society during the much-maligned
and little-understood middle ages.
Protestantism, even when, as in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_735" id="Page_735">[735]</a></span>
own time, professing to labor for liberty,
only falsifies it, and interposes insurmountable
obstacles to its realization.
Protestantism&mdash;and we have
studied it both as a Protestant and as
a Catholic&mdash;is made up of false pretences;
is, as Carlyle would say, an
unveracity, and loses not only the
eternal world, but also this present
world. The Divine Thought after
which the universe is created and
governed is one and catholic, and
the law by which we gain our final
end is one and holy; and without
obedience to it there is no good possible,
here or hereafter, either for society
or for the individual. The present
can have its fulfilment only in
the future, and the temporal has its
origin, medium, and end only in the
spiritual, and finds its true support as
its true law only in the one eternal
law of God, the universal Lawgiver,
declared and applied by the one
Holy Catholic Church, which he
himself has instituted for that purpose,
and which is his body, which he
animates, and in which he dwells,
teaches, and governs.</p>

<p>It remains for us to consider the
respective relations of Protestantism
and Catholicity to religious liberty,
or the freedom of conscience.</p>

<h2>UNTYING GORDIAN KNOTS.</h2>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>George Holston was wandering
thoughtfully back and forward in his
writing-room, in a listless way, unusual
in a man of his active temperament.
An ardent sight-seer, a student
of the politics of all countries, a visitor
of every kind of institution for the
amelioration of every kind of difficulty
he gave little time to lounging.
Pausing at last before one of
the windows looking out on the garden,
his attention became fixed, and
an expression at once of displeasure
and of amusement came over his face.</p>

<p>Under the tree sat Lady Sackvil,
half reclining on a garden chair; before
her stood Vane, answering her
indifferent words with eager interest,
his expressive face full of enthusiasm.
Whatever his arguments were, they
took effect, to judge by the change
which gradually mastered her; rousing
her from the careless posture to
one of attention, drawing her eyes
from the flower she had been idly
pulling to pieces, to meet his earnest
gaze. Whatever the question might
be, he had conquered, and was gazing
at her beautiful upturned face
with a look of enchantment.</p>

<p>"Confound it!" muttered George.
"What would I give to banish her
to the coast of Guinea this very moment!
Enough to evangelize the
natives, if money would do it." He
resumed his desultory walk and his
meditations. "That idiot is going to
destruction for the lack of something
to do. No more in love with her
than I am; just idleness and a love
of excitement."</p>

<p>Going to his desk, he took out a
letter written in copying-ink, and bearing
date of three weeks back.</p>

<p>"I've scotched the snake, at least,
with this," he said aloud, and sat
down to a re-perusal of the epistle. It
was as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_736" id="Page_736">[736]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Evans</span>: I see by the newspapers
that three officers of the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;A.
have been appointed to visit the Crimea,
and study the position and progress of
affairs in the French and English armies.
You will oblige me extremely
by going to General Scott, on receipt
of this, and asking him, in my name,
to obtain a fourth appointment in the
person of Captain Vane, of the &mdash;th
Cavalry, U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;A., subject to Vane's approval.
For several reasons, too long
to explain, I do not mention this plan
to him before writing; but I have no
doubt that he will jump at the proposal
when it comes. The general
and the secretary of war will need no
explanations. They know that Vane
has been on the sick-list for wounds
received in frontier service, and they
are much interested in him and his
family; therefore no apologies are
necessary for making the proposal.</p>

<p>"Vane is a constant and serious student
of military matters, and no man
is more likely than he to make a
good use of such an opportunity.</p>

<p>"If objections are made on the
grounds of extra pay, you may say
that no such increase is necessary, as
Captain Vane has a large private fortune.</p>

<p>"Hoping soon to have a chance to
reciprocate the kindness I ask of you,
my dear Evans, I am</p>

<p>
"Yours always truly,</p>

<p class="signature">"<span class="smcap">George Holston</span>."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>George put away the letter and
went to the window.</p>

<p>"If I had asked his leave before
doing this, he would have been too
weak to grant it, hampered as he is
by this renewal of old associations.
By the time the appointment gets
here, he will be thankful to find some
way of escape from his own folly
open to him. A fool he is&mdash;a traitor
he is not."</p>

<p>Then, casting a glance out of the
window, as he passed before it to take
down a volume from a bookcase, he
said softly, "Poor Mary! the truest,
noblest woman that ever married an
idiot!"</p>

<p>George Holston might well say
"poor Mary!" He had not been the
only witness of the interview in the
garden. This was the day of Mrs.
Vane's first visit to the <i>primo piano</i>
since her illness. She had come in a
young mother's glory, bringing little
Georgina in her christening dress to
see her godmother. While Mrs. Holston
was tending the baby, Mary
stood at the window, playing with a
curtain-tassel and watching her husband
and Lady Sackvil. She saw
him give Amelia the oleander she
pulled to pieces, saw her grow eager
and interested as he talked to her,
stood transfixed to see the intensity
with which he followed up his advantage;
and then, suddenly recollecting
herself, turned away, thinking bitterly,
"I will not spy upon him."</p>

<p>"What is the matter, dear?" asked
Mrs. Holston anxiously. "You were
looking so well when you came in,
and now you are as white as a handkerchief.
Are you faint? Debby,
ring the bell, and I will send for some
wine."</p>

<p>"Oh! please not," said Mary, putting
her hand to her head. "I'm
well enough, only so very tired. This
is my first visit, you know," she added,
laughing faintly, "and the excitement
is too much for me. I will
leave the baby with you, and nurse
can bring her to me when you are
tired of her. No, don't come, Debby;
I shall be better for resting a little
while."</p>

<p>And lying quietly on the couch in
her own room, the bitter conviction
came to her, that what she had seen
that day stung her so deeply only
because it confirmed doubts crushed
out of sight. Doubts? Certainty it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_737" id="Page_737">[737]</a></span>
was now, that she was no longer her
husband's chosen companion. Startled
by his anger when her first
groundless jealousy betrayed itself on
the day of Lady Sackvil's arrival, she
had smothered every succeeding pang.
Her uneasiness had come from no
lack of kindness on her husband's
part. He had been, if possible, more
attentive during her illness than she
had expected. But to her, who had
been his exclusive confidant, the one
chosen sympathizer in all hopes and
projects, the charm had gone. It
was evident that he needed more excitement
than her companionship afforded,
that he came to her from a
sense of duty, not for pleasure. She
had been too loyal to question or
doubt until this afternoon, when an
accident had given the proofs she
would have refused to seek. Now
she was too clear-sighted to withhold
belief. Lady Sackvil stood between
her and her husband.</p>

<p>She was too completely stunned,
too grieved and wounded, to look beyond
the present shock, to question
the hopelessness of her situation.
Above the couch hung an ivory crucifix
yellow with age. Nicholas had
found it in some curiosity-shop near
the Rialto, and brought it to her.
She took it down and looked at it,
not only reverently but curiously,
wondering whose agony it had soothed;
if ever any one had pressed it
to a heart so wronged and tortured
as hers; if it were yellowed by the
tears shed upon it, as well as by age.
"You will be yellow as gold before
my eyes have cried themselves out,"
she thought, and longed for the relief
of tears. Her thoughts were so thick,
so hopelessly thick and inextricable!
Afraid of revealing her sufferings if
she should go to dinner, she went to
bed with a furious headache. The
baby, sharing its mother's discomposure,
wept and wailed, as babies always
do when quiet is most desirable.
Nicholas dined alone, spent an hour
in his wife's room in the kindest manner,
putting cold water on her head,
and ice to her heart at the same moment.
At last, believing her to be
asleep, he went down to spend the
evening with the Holstons; leaving
her to be regaled with distant sounds
of playing and singing, and to be
racked by the conviction that a trial
had fallen upon her with which she
was utterly incapable of coping.</p>

<p>A night-light burned in the corner
of the room, giving a faint suggestion
of surrounding objects. Through the
half-open nursery-door came the
sound of Deborah lulling the baby to
sleep with old songs and moral axioms.
There was something soothing in the
half-light and subdued tones which
tended to restore the quivering nerves
to their balance. Mary sat up in bed
and tried to collect her ideas. What
was the first thing to be done? The
exact reverse of what she had done
that evening, at all events. She had
made the baby fretful, and driven
Nicholas into the very temptation
she most dreaded for him.</p>

<p>The first and immediate step to be
taken was to conquer the nervous
prostration which bound her. All
was now quiet in the nursery. She
rang her hand-bell softly, bringing
Deborah to the nursery-door with the
inseparable roll of violet-perfumed
flannel in her arms.</p>

<p>"Put baby down by me, nurse, and
give me some valerian; there's a good
soul."</p>

<p>Then she lay down to contemplate
the baby and let the sedative work.
Her thoughts turned to a few words
of fatherly advice from her old friend,
Padre Giulio, when she had mentioned
with bitter self-upbraiding in confession,
two months before, her momentary
paroxysm of jealousy. "In
five cases out of ten," he had said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_738" id="Page_738">[738]</a></span>
"an injured wife holds her fate in her
own hands. She must prove to her
husband that she is better worth loving
than any other woman in the
world. She should speak of her
wrongs to no one if she can possibly
bear them in silence. Each confidant
of these delicate matters may become
a new obstacle to reconciliation. Loyalty
is most important between married
persons. So much for jealous
wives, my daughter; and God grant
that you may never have occasion to
remember what I have said!" And
now the occasion had come!</p>

<p>"O God!" she prayed, "make me
very lovely in his eyes. I don't ask
it for vanity's sake, but for his honor
and mine. I thank you, from the
depths of my heart, that it is best for
him and for me, and for your divine
glory, that he should love me more
than any other creature. But accomplish
this, dear Lord, by making him
love you best of all." Then she fell
asleep, lulled by the soft breathing of
the sleeping infant.</p>

<p>She was waked by hearing Nicholas
come gently into the room.</p>

<p>"I am sorry I roused you," he said.
"But I longed to know if you were relieved."</p>

<p>"I am much better," she answered
cordially. "Thank you for coming
to inquire. Have you had a pleasant
evening?"</p>

<p>"Quite pleasant," he replied absently.
"Did the piano disturb
you?"</p>

<p>"Only just at first. I got through
the evening very comfortably, and expect
to be bright and well by to-morrow.
Kiss me, darling."</p>

<p>"Good night, Mary. God bless
you!"</p>

<p>When he had left her, she took the
ancient crucifix again in her hands, and
kissed the five wounds silently. There
is no better prayer. It is the prayer
of conquered self; the acceptance of
our sufferings in union with those of
Christ.</p>

<p>"I must get well and be his second
guardian angel," she said.</p>

<p>Vane spent half the night in studying
and reading. Once he said out
loud, "God help me through it!"
Then came the thought, "How dare
I ask for help, when I myself have
sought temptation? Oh! if Mary
would only get well and be my better
self once more. What did she say
once about the inefficacy of vicarious
goodness?"</p>


<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>"May I come in?" asked Mary at
the door of Lady Sackvil's music-room.</p>

<p>"By all means. I am going to
play something for George and Flossy
that will fascinate your maternal
fancy." And with the little boy and
girl on either side, she played the
<i>Scenes from Childhood</i>, with little paraphrases
of explanation full of merriment
or pathos, as the case might be.
The children were bewitched. Mary
looked at her lovely face, her tasteful
dress, her graceful though rather
large hands, moving on the piano as
in a native element; she listened to
her exquisitely sympathetic playing,
to her charming talk with the children,
and a sense of despair came
over her.</p>

<p>"How can I win him back?" she
thought. "O God! it is so hard to
bear, just because I am not handsome
or clever. Surely my love, my fidelity
must be more beautiful than her
beauty, if he could only see clearly.
It is useless for me to compete with
this exquisite creature on any natural
grounds. And yet, how strange it all
is! I don't suppose he is the most
attractive man in existence; and yet,
it would no more occur to me to
measure him with other men than if
he were an archangel."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_739" id="Page_739">[739]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady Sackvil was singing now&mdash;little
songs for children, by Taubert,
cradle songs, and <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Volkslieder</i>. George
and Flossy were twins, and this was
their birthday. "Aunt Milly" was as
much bent on fascinating her juvenile
audience as any <i>prima donna</i> in
a royal theatre. She had not much
voice; but her singing had the same
sympathetic quality which made her
playing delight every one, learned or
unlearned. Those who were incapable
of appreciating her sound musical
training, her clever interpretation of
the best compositions, her freedom
from mannerism, whether pedantry or
sentimentality, could derive pleasure
from her delicious touch and the indefinable
grace of her playing.</p>

<p>After a while Mrs. Holston and
Captain Vane joined the audience.
Mary glanced involuntarily at Lady
Sackvil, and saw a rosy flush suffuse
cheek and brow and neck. She passed
on from song to song without
leaving the piano; but she was singing
for grown people now, and the
children felt it. Mary made a sign
to them to come to her, and gave
them the presents she had prepared
for the great day so long anticipated.
Mere trifles they were&mdash;a suit of doll's
furs for Flossy, a box of colored crayons
for George&mdash;but it was quite
enough to restore the birthday equanimity.</p>

<p>Vane had noticed the little scene,
and Mary saw his eyes rest upon
her with a tenderness she had missed
for many weeks. When Lady Sackvil
stopped singing, he rose rather abruptly
and returned her greeting with
a certain coldness. Then turning to
his wife, he said, "I have been looking
for you everywhere. Can you
come up-stairs with me now?"</p>

<p>Mary was nearer happiness than she
had thought to be again. At least
he was trying to do right.</p>


<h3>VIII.<br />

LADY SACKVIL'S JOURNAL.</h3>

<p>I wonder what sin is? Some people
would say I ought to know; but I
do not. We are born with inclinations,
affections, passions which disappear
or develop according to circumstances.
We are not to be praised
if they disappear; we are not to be
blamed if they develop. Religionists
make sins and virtues to suit
themselves, and form thereon a moral
code. If they really believe in a merciful,
thoughtful Creator, a tender Redeemer,
who has lived to exemplify
these virtues and died to atone for
these sins, of course they do right to
bow to his will. I do not believe
there is a God who interests himself
in our virtues or vices, so-called. I
know that I myself am the creature of
necessity, and I mean to prove this
for my own satisfaction by a review
of my career.</p>

<p>I was educated by my poor Aunt
Louisa, who taught me to call myself
a Catholic and behave like a pagan.
Was that my fault? She never, to my
knowledge, acted from a disinterested
motive. She never taught me to obey
any thing but my own will&mdash;except
hers, when our wills crossed. This was
very seldom; for we, both of us, wanted
simply the greatest amount of worldly
enjoyment that was to be had, for
asking, in my case, and scheming, in
hers. Was that my fault? I loved
Nicholas Vane, who was a tyrant.
Just when his tyranny weighed too
heavily to be borne, Lord Sackvil appeared.
He suited me. His position
corresponded to the dreams my
aunt had nursed in me from childhood.
Circumstances conquered me.
Vane accused me of flirting, and broke
off our private engagement. Aunt
Louisa besought me to accept an offer
which would realize her fondest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_740" id="Page_740">[740]</a></span>
hopes for me. I yielded, and married
Sackvil, and never dreamed of regretting
the step. He was the kindest
and most indulgent of husbands, and
sympathized with all my tastes. But
here again any religious tendencies I
might have had remained unnourished.
Educated a Catholic, he never
practised his religion. People think
me obstinate; on the contrary, I am
led completely by others&mdash;<em>when it
suits me</em>. What of that? How could
it be otherwise, with my training? I
am the victim of circumstances. As
I had no children, Sackvil House passed
to a distant relation of my husband.
I was left singularly alone in the
world. My one near relative living in
Venice, I naturally came to her, after
leading a wandering life in Germany
for two years. Who should be living
in the same house and on terms
of closest intimacy with my sister's
family but Captain Vane? Was
that my fault? I did not know the
fact. Flora knows nothing of our
engagement; indeed, no one knew
of it except Aunt Louisa, and, probably,
George Holston. I fully intended
to cultivate Mrs. Vane intimately.
In the first place, however, she is not
inclined to intimacy. Though very
young, she has a reserve and independence
of character which would make
friendship a matter of slow growth
with her. In the second place, she
has been ill or ailing ever since I
came here. Is that my fault? Is it
my fault that at thirty I am prettier
than ever before in my life; that I
have a trick of fascinating people;
that I play and sing like&mdash;like&mdash;like
a fallen angel? This is conceit, or
pride, or vanity, I suppose. No, it is
not. It is a recognition of facts. If
I were ugly or unattractive, I should
recognize the fact and poison myself.
Is it my fault that Vane is morally
weak, as the term goes? That is
to say, that his personal wishes weigh
more heavily upon him than the force
of tradition? Is it my fault that, with
the energy, the ambition, and the intellectual
tastes of a man, I am bound
by worldly maxims within limits
which restrict all growth except spiritual
growth?</p>

<p>I wonder what would make a
Christian of me? This one experience&mdash;hypothetical,
of course: the
sight, the close, intimate perception of
a purely disinterested soul; of one who,
tested in the sorest manner, should act
according to principles formed in a
time of peace and security. I am
a pagan from having seen people
behave like pagans, no matter what
they professed. The antidote must
be adapted to the poison. Is a cure
to be desired? I imagine not. A
Christian life would entail great discomfort;
for be it known that if ever
I am a Christian I will be a genuine
one. My difficulties are not metaphysical.
I could just as easily believe
one thing as another; indeed,
the more the better, if there is any
believing to be done. I am inclined
to suppose that the Catholic Church
will have the honor to reclaim me, if
ever I am reclaimed. It is the oldest,
widest, strongest, and it demands
more of its adherents than any other
church. Besides, if ever I find my
disinterested Christian, it will probably
be in the Catholic Church&mdash;a soul
bred upon works of supererogation
and a thirst after perfection.</p>


<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>Mary was reading in her morning
room when Lady Sackvil was announced.
"Ask her to come in here," she
said with her lips; and in her heart
prayed, "Help me to do and say the
right thing."</p>

<p>Lady Sackvil came in very softly,
seeing the little basket-cradle with
drawn curtains beside the mother's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_741" id="Page_741">[741]</a></span>
chair, and said in a low tone, "Thank
you very much for admitting me to
your own room."</p>

<p>"We need not speak low," Mary
said; "poor little Georgina has had
to learn to sleep under all circumstances.
I knew it was useless to try
to make Captain Vane whisper, and
I wanted him to come here freely
when the child was with me; so I
have made her a philosopher early in
life, superior to outward influences."</p>

<p>"She will be the first person that
ever was superior to circumstances, I
fancy," remarked Lady Sackvil; and
added after a moment's pause, "my
belief is, that our characters are completely
controlled by outward influences.
They have regulated mine, I
know."</p>

<p>Mary took up a stole she was embroidering
in bullion, and arranged
the sewing materials accurately before
answering. Amelia's mere presence
irritated her, and the off-hand
manner in which her ladyship settled
questions aroused in her a spirit of
opposition. It was in an unruffled
tone, however, that she answered,
"Of course they have a great deal to
do with the formation of character;
but not every thing. I used to hear
a good deal of talk on the subject
in my father's library. An intimate
friend of his was a necessitarian&mdash;that's
the term, is it not?&mdash;and used
to bring forward many clever arguments
in support of his theory."</p>

<p>"And convinced you?" asked Amelia
with interest.</p>

<p>"Not at all. He worried me a
good deal at first. I remember that
he generally chose Sunday evenings
for the discussion, and Sunday evening
has ever since been uncomfortably
associated in my mind with necessity
and free-will."</p>

<p>"I cannot fancy on what grounds
his opinion could be combated," said
Lady Sackvil.</p>

<p>"Neither did I at first. It is easier
to argue in favor of necessity than of
free-will. The theory rests upon tangible
facts, evident even to superficial
observers. The truth rests largely
upon supernatural facts, too subtle to
be fully appreciated except through
personal experience."</p>

<p>"May I ask how you satisfied
yourself?" asked Amelia with the
faintest shade of contempt in her
voice. She was feeling "out of sorts,"
and controversy suited the mood of
the moment better than ordinary conversation.</p>

<p>Mary renewed the gold thread in
her needle and the patience in her
soul, and then answered, "By reading
the lives of the saints, and especially
of holy penitents. I became
satisfied that even if ordinary souls are
controlled by circumstances, (though
even that point I did not concede,)
the development of the saints has
often been not only independent of
circumstances, but inconsistent with
them. Women, enslaved by vanity
or passion, breaking through every
bond and trampling on temptation to
embrace a life of penance at which
flesh trembles! Men, enthralled by
false philosophy, becoming little children
in faith and simplicity! I knew
that this could not be the result of
circumstances. Then carrying the
investigation into my own moral experience,
I found that even I could
be noble under the same circumstances
where I had been petty. I do not
attempt to speak philosophically. I
argue from practical facts."</p>

<p>"If I placed much faith in the
lives of saints, perhaps we might
think alike," answered Amelia; "but
most of them are quite mythical, no
doubt."</p>

<p>"The lives of St. Augustine, St.
Jerome, and many more are as well
authenticated as the Norman conquest,"
Mary said; "and those whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_742" id="Page_742">[742]</a></span>
careers are most mysterious experienced
nothing which is incomprehensible
to any one who studies interior
life, and knows the capacities of
his own soul for receiving supernatural
graces."</p>

<p>"The capacities of <em>my</em> soul are extremely
limited, I think," replied Lady
Sackvil. "Like you, I found my impressions
on practical facts, not on
metaphysics; so that our argument is
at an end, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Apparently," said Mary good-humoredly.
"I've not heard the piano
lately. Why is that?"</p>

<p>"I am tired to death of playing,"
said Lady Sackvil; "at times it is an
unutterable bore. For a composer it
is, of course, different. The exercise
of the creative faculty must be simply
rapture; but mere interpretation palls
frightfully at times."</p>

<p>"Is there no new music to interest
you?"</p>

<p>"Very seldom. I am familiar with
the whole range of musical literature.
Don't look at me as if I were a wonder.
It's no great thing for a well-trained
musician to say. Musical literature,
as compared with the world
of books, is very limited. The present
age is idle and unproductive; and
so there come times when I shut the
piano and feel that my 'occupation's
gone.'"</p>

<p>She rose, and going gently to the
cradle, knelt down beside it to watch
the sleeping child. A tenderness
came over her face, before so full of
weariness and pain.</p>

<p>"I would have been a different woman
if I had been a mother," she
said, looking up at Mary with tears
in her eyes. "Love of children and
vanity are the only traits I have," she
added, smiling sadly.</p>

<p>Mary made no answer, but looked
at the tossed, selfish, whimsical being
before her with an interest she had not
felt hitherto.</p>

<p>"Isn't it heavenly sweet to have a
child?" asked Amelia; "to hold that
creature close to you, and feel that it
is your own as your heart is your
own?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is heavenly sweet," answered
Mary, bending over the baby,
who just then opened her violet eyes.
The mother took the little creature
into her arms and kissed her softly.
"It <em>is</em> heavenly sweet," she repeated.</p>

<p>Lady Sackvil drew down her veil
and rose to go. "Good-by," she said
huskily. "Don't think that I usually
make such eccentric morning calls."
And was gone before Mary could ring
for a servant to open the door.</p>

<h2>CHURCH MUSIC.</h2>

<p class="center">III.</p>


<p>We have one question to ask of
such of our readers who have taken
the trouble to read our former articles
on the subject of church music. Is
it not a false tradition that the music
in our churches exhibits the character
of a musical concert performed during
Mass, or replacing the office of
Vespers? One thing is certain&mdash;it is
a Protestant tradition, an Anglo-Saxon
Protestant tradition. Although
we owe the "classical masses" chiefly
to German and Italian composers,
the style of the performance, the <i>matériel</i>
of the choir, and the <i>choir-gallery</i>
are the offspring of the "chapel"
and the "conventicle." It has doubtless
been observed that we have been
arguing for a twofold reform in this
matter: firstly, in the music, and secondly,
in its performance. We use
the word reform in its proper sense,
and desire by our remarks to call our
brethren back to the old paths of the
Holy Church, not to introduce some
new fashion in doctrine or devotion.
We would renovate, not innovate.
We have been too long deprived of
that spiritual food which is so abundantly
supplied by the sacred offices
of the Church. Protestantism has
given us nothing but husks to eat,
and we confess to being hungry. By
the defection of England and the
greater part of Germany, we were robbed
of our holy sanctuaries, and in
our poverty have been forced to content
ourselves with buildings to which,
indeed, we give the name of churches,
but which are nothing better than
convenient shelters for an altar crowded
to its very steps by the people.
The new-fangled doctrine drove out
our monks, and perverted the devout
clerics who once filled the stalls of
real <i>choirs</i>, and whose duty and glory
it was to sing the divine office. When
the novel worship that replaced the
Holy Sacrifice built new tabernacles
for its meagre and unmeaning rites, it
invented the <i>singing-gallery</i> and the
modern <i>choir</i>, all-sufficing, we acknowledge,
for the Anglican "common
prayer," and "worship" after
the Presbyterian, Methodist, Baptist,
and other such modes, but wholly out
of place in a Catholic church, and totally
inadequate for the holy offices
of our religion.</p>

<p>Surely there is no one who will not
heartily agree with us that we need a
thorough reform, in this respect, in
our church architecture. We build
chapels, but not churches. The place
for the altar is in the Choir, an inclosure
specially set apart for the sacred
ministers and the singers, who at
the public functions form one officiating
body. We have followed the example
of Protestants, and made use
of the pencil of the Protestant architect;
and the result is, that if the gates
of hell ever incited another "glorious
reformation," like that of the sixteenth
century, the new reformers
would have the advantage over the
first in finding churches not only ready
made, but admirably adapted to
their requirements, the change of altar
into pulpit, should the new doctrine
need such an appurtenance in its
meeting-houses, being a matter of
small expense. They would not be
put to their wits to know what to do
with our choirs "of mysterious depth,"
as of yore, but would find an appropriate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_744" id="Page_744">[744]</a></span>
gallery for their hired singers,
already fitted up, with its abominable
rood-screen of green curtains
over the doorways. We have heard
our holy rites and ceremonies nicknamed
as the "rags of popery."
What has Protestantism done but to
rend the "rags" into tatters?</p>

<p>Nor are we ready to admit the
poverty of our resources as a full justification
of our imitation of Protestant
service in the style of our sacred
music and its performance. Throughout
the continent of Europe, where
Protestant influences have not been
at work, there are countless country
churches of small size, but not one is
without its sanctuary choir; and the
people would as soon think of putting
their robed priests into dress-coat and
pantaloons as of banishing their surpliced
chanters from the sanctuary,
and erecting a choir-gallery behind
their backs. We bring no railing accusation.
We deprecate that style of
argument which is successful only in
provoking opposition; but are endeavoring,
with no end in view save the
glory of God and the honor of religion,
to put in a plain light the causes
of our departure from the common
authorized usages of the church; usages
to which the want of conformity
will always be the measure of the loss
of faith and devotion.</p>

<p>Our controversialists have been arguing
against the false doctrines of
Protestantism, and have done their
work in a masterly and effective manner.
If ever there was a dead doctrine
awaiting burial, it is Protestantism.
Now let us turn our attention
to its false traditions, possessing more
vitality because they have obtained a
sort of parasitical subsistence through
our partial admission of their encroachments.
We mean that the
"choir-gallery" is, both in its entity
and object, a parasite of Protestant
tradition clinging to our holy temples,
disfiguring their fair proportions and
spiritually cramping the growth of liturgical
devotion, destroying its charm,
and stifling its inspirations.</p>

<p>We propose to get rid of this piece
of uncatholic tradition; to locate the
singers in the place prescribed by the
ritual, and abolish the musical concert.
We desire to see the distinct
decrees of the Church carried out to
the letter, which require the divine
office to be sung, as well as the Mass
to be said, in the sanctuary, before the
people, and not behind them. We
have already alluded to the efforts
made in England to bring this matter
into perfect conformity with the ritual.
His Grace the Archbishop of
Westminster has forbidden any new
church to be opened unless there is
provision made for a <i>sanctuary choir</i>;
and the cardinal vicar, in his instruction
of November 18th, 1856, after administering
a severe reprimand for the
want of observance of regulations
made in former instructions, prescribes,
among other things, that galleries for
singers shall not be placed over the
doors of churches. Evidently the
good cardinal has not only studied
rubrics, but the science of acoustics
as well. An elevated gallery near the
ceiling is a wretched place for singers,
and not much better for an organ.
Ask any organ-builder whether
he would not much prefer placing his
instrument on the floor of the church,
to hiding it away in some loft or second-story
alcove in a tower. The
impropriety is so glaring, and the arrangement
is at once so incongruous
and unartistic, that we deem further
discussion on this point useless. The
able writer in <cite>The Dublin Review</cite>,
whom we have already quoted, very
pertinently remarks:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In this respect we have been equally
out of harmony with ecclesiastical tradition
and practice; and if we are to save ourselves
from disappointment with our choristers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_745" id="Page_745">[745]</a></span>
we must make up our minds to give them
the advantage of all the sacred associations
which that system provides. In other
words, we must substitute a proper choral
arrangement in connection with the sanctuary
for that now prevailing, and with which
so many abuses are unhappily connected.
There need, we think, be no practical difficulty
about this, and we would suggest it as
a matter worthy of serious consideration by
our clergy and Catholic architects who are
about to build or restore churches. The
time is surely gone by for the stereotyped
plan of an east end with an altar under a
large window, flanked by a smaller altar on
either side, involving, besides other inconveniences,
the impossibility of making any
provision for the proper choral arrangements.
Several instances might be adduced
of churches recently erected in which the
beautiful and convenient feature of side altars
has been introduced, thus allowing the
choir to occupy their proper place&mdash;the organ,
of course, being placed at the side, and
ample space being still left for the sanctuary
proper. We should say that, even in
cases where boys cannot be at once procured
for the choir, it is very unadvisable to
plan a building in such a way as to preclude
a proper arrangement afterward."</p></blockquote>

<p>Have we any objections to urge
against coming into harmony with
ecclesiastical tradition and practice in
this matter? A friend at our side
urges one, doubtless in the mind of
many of our readers: Then you
would banish all female voices from
our choirs?</p>

<p>We will allow a much better authority
than ourselves to answer for us.
The following extract is from a decree
of the Provincial Synod of Holland,
held at Utrecht, and highly commended
by the Holy Father:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the same way as the object of church
music is quite frustrated when it is of such a
character as only to gratify the ears with vain
pleasures, so, too, the dignity of divine worship
is not preserved unless the singers also
are such as to beseem the church. Women's
voices are not admitted by ecclesiastical
usage into the choir of singers, since the
rules of divine worship and the dignity of
ecclesiastical music evidently require their
exclusion. For in the same way as they are
withheld from all share in the ministry of
the holy liturgy, so also every thing effeminate
ought to be quite excluded from church
singing; and hence the presence of women
in an ecclesiastical choir is opposed to the
very sense of the faithful. Therefore, we
decree and order that women be altogether
excluded from the choir of singers, unless
in the churches or chapels of nuns. And if
hereafter, in violation of this injunction of
this Provincial Synod, women be employed
in any church as singers or organists, let the
rectors of those churches be aware that they
will have to render a most strict account
to the ordinary for such an infraction of the
law." (Syn. Prov. Ultrajectan., tit. 5, cap. 6.)</p></blockquote>

<p>And again:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The tradition of the church in excluding
women from choirs is so universal and inflexible
that it is not easy to understand how
it should have been so widely forgotten in
this country. I can only conceive that the
confusion of all things under the penal laws,
the shattered and informal state of the church
in England after its emancipation, our poverty,
not only of money, but of culture to do
better; and, finally, the force of custom in
rendering us insensible to many anomalies,
have been the real causes of our ever admitting,
and of our so long passively tolerating,
so visible a deviation from the tradition
and mind of the Church. It is strange that
you should have to argue a case which the
Church has decided." (Letter of Archbishop
Manning to Canon Oakeley.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The argument of the very reverend
canon, to which his grace alludes,
contains much that would interest
our readers, but our space does
not permit us to give it entire. We
cannot refrain, however, from making
a short quotation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"That a choir of male voices is actually
that provision for the solemn celebration of
divine worship which the Church contemplates,
to the exclusion of every other, is, I
think, a fact which cannot reasonably be disputed.
The Church no more recognizes
female choristers than female sacristans,
though she may tolerate either in case of necessity.
The single exception to the rule is
in convents, for obvious reasons. According
to the ancient arrangement of churches, the
choir is immediately connected with the
sanctuary; and those who take part in it are
most appropriately habited as clerics. The
circumstances of modern times have led to
some deviation from this practice, so far as
it depends upon the architectural arrangements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_746" id="Page_746">[746]</a></span>
of our churches; but even where the
choir is detached from the sanctuary, the
ancient and universal rule of the Church
which excludes females (probably in accordance
with apostolical tradition) from taking,
any active and ministerial part in divine worship,
is still rigidly observed. Not only in
Rome, but in countries which retain certain
national peculiarities in the sacred administration
of the Church, such as France and Belgium,
the practice of employing females in the
musical department of divine worship is, I believe,
unknown. It is almost entirely confined
to those countries, such as Great Britain,
parts of Germany, and the United States
of America, in which Protestantism prevails
and produces a certain impression on the outward
aspect even of the Church herself. In
our own country the type of the ancient
worship, which has been innovated on among
ourselves, is preserved in the national cathedrals,
in which the large endowments derived
from Catholic munificence enable the present
usurpers to represent the true ecclesiastical
form of the choral service with a facility
which is denied to those to whom it
belongs by undisputed inheritance. Meanwhile,
this type had till recently suffered considerable
decay among ourselves. Dethroned
from our rightful position, we had in this,
as in other far more important respects, fallen
in with the ways of the sects around us.
But the revival of the ecclesiastical spirit
which has come in with the events of the
last few years, has brought home to us some
of the anomalies which had grown up in the
day of our depression, while increased communication
with the continent has tended to
bring our external worship into more and
more of union with general practice. It is
hardly necessary to observe that the admission
of females into the church choir is absolutely
fatal to the retention of the proper
cathedral type of worship, while in parish
churches it is sometimes productive of obvious
evils, and even in the best regulated administrations
is adverse to the spirit which
should animate every part of divine worship,
and especially one so intimately connected
with its dignified celebration as that of the
choir."</p></blockquote>

<p>It will be observed that our judgment
about the influences of Protestant tradition
upon our church music has not
been made unadvisedly.</p>

<p>In Germany, female singers were
introduced into the churches for no
better reason, that we can discover,
than to exhibit the musical talent of
its great masters. These compositions
were not written to supply any want
for such music felt in the churches, but
at the instance and under the patronage
of nobles and princes, who vied
with each other in giving grand sacred
musical feasts in their private
chapels, as <i>gourmands</i> pride themselves
on giving costly and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">recherché</i>
dinners to show off the science of their
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef de cuisine</i>. If we imagine that
these musical masses were gotten up
to excite greater devotion in the gay
and worldly courtiers, we are much
mistaken. It was, in fact, a nice little
bit of cheap luxury, it being less
expensive to keep a private chapel
and entertain a private chaplain, than
to support an opera-house with its
company of artists, scene-shifters, and
hangers-on.</p>

<p>Composers themselves have sought
to obtain at least a general permission
for the singing of their masses
from the ecclesiastical authorities, but
have invariably been met with a polite
expression of regret that such
application had been presented, as it
was entirely out of the power, etc., etc.
Rossini petitioned the present pope
for permission to include females in
church choirs, but of course without
success. The report of his own funeral
obsequies shows that more thought
was given to enjoy a rare musical entertainment
than to pray for his soul:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The church bore the appearance of a
concert-room or theatre. People came in
with their hats on, talking and laughing.
After each piece of music was sung, their
<i>bravos</i> were barely restrained, and more than
once applauding cries seemed about to break
forth. The majority of the congregation,
forgetting both the altar and the corpse of
the deceased, turned their faces toward the
tribune of the singers, talking in a loud
voice, and using their opera-glasses; and
this at the very moment of the <i>elevation</i>, when
the soldiers who served as a guard of honor,
at the command of their officer, were falling
on their knees. This scandal was deplored
not only by religious persons, but even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_747" id="Page_747">[747]</a></span>
by the true friends of art, because it served
once more to prove that such musical solemnities,
in this age and in this country,
are incompatible with the respect due to the
sanctity of churches."</p></blockquote>

<p>If we might venture to offer a word
in justification of the wisdom of the
Church in thus wholly excluding women
from the ritual offices of religion,
we would say that she "knows what
is in man;" she perfectly well understands
all the effects of exterior influences
upon the human mind and
heart; that the female voice, when
highly cultivated or sweet-toned, is
alluring and sensual, (we do not mean
in a bad sense,) and when naturally
poor or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">passé</i>, is equally repelling and
disagreeable. The first cannot be said
of the voices of men; nor the second,
unless it be in attempts to execute music
beyond their compass, or when
they distort its sense or expression by
vanity or affectation.</p>

<p>Canon Oakeley shall sum up for us
what we have to say on this head:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Together with the name of 'chapels,'
which it may be hoped we are in the way to
renounce once for all, let us divest ourselves
of all that smacks of the chapel and dissenting
system&mdash;the pews, the pew-openers, the
female sacristans, and the female choristers.
One of the principal lessons taught us by our
great cardinal was the duty of asserting in
all judicious ways the dignity of our true position;
and this we can do only by ridding
ourselves of sectarian habits, down even to
the very fringes of our garment, and associating
ourselves in spirit, and in that which
forms so especial a test of the ecclesiastical
spirit, the external worship of the Church,
with the most approved practice of Catholic
countries."</p></blockquote>

<p>Having made up our minds to tear
down our Protestant singing-gallery,
and to make use only of male voices
in the singing of Mass and Vespers,
we shall not fear for the decision of
the question, What kind of music
is to be selected? The Gregorian
chant, that "grave, sweet, majestic,
intellectual music of the Church," will
defy all competition. When half the
labor and expense has been bestowed
upon the true music of the sanctuary
as is now lavished on our florid concert
music, then will be said to-day
what Pope Benedict XIV. said so
long ago, "The titillation of figured
music is held very cheaply by men of
religious mind, in comparison with the
sweetness of the church chant."</p>

<p>But the other question, and a very
practical one, yet remains: How shall
we procure and hold proper singers
for such music as is proposed, and for
such a place as the sacred inclosure
about the altar? We answer, in the
first place, we have already some men
singers with voices of good compass
and power, who at present sing up-stairs
beside the organ.</p>

<p>"What!" exclaims the friend at
our elbow; "bring our present choir
down into the sanctuary? How many
priests, do you think, would do that?"</p>

<p>We reply to him, that, if the present
choir-singers are fit and proper persons
to be associated with the sacred
ministers in the celebration of the divine
mysteries, they are just as worthy
at one end of the church as at the
other; and if they are unworthy for
any reason, they ought not to be allowed
to take that part, or exercise
that office of dignity in any nook or
corner of our sacred temples. This
capital point, the personal worthiness
as well as the vocal capabilities of
our choir-singers, has, it must be confessed,
not been so rigidly insisted on
in general as it might have been. Nothing
appears to our minds more
shockingly incongruous than a mixed
chorus of Catholics, Protestants, and
Jews singing the Credo. We remember
hearing a fine Tantum Ergo sung
as a solo at benediction by a Jewess.
Think of it, a Jewess singing,</p>

<div class="cpoem" lang="la" xml:lang="la"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Et antiquum documentum<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Novo cedat ritui"!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and, in the presence of what she believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_748" id="Page_748">[748]</a></span>
to be only a piece of bread,
adding,</p>

<div class="cpoem" lang="la" xml:lang="la"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Præstet fides supplementum<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sensuum defectui"!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We like the language of the Bishop
of Langres. In a late pastoral on this
subject, he says,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The function of which we speak (singer)
is one that deserves respect for its sanctity.
For many centuries it was reserved to clerics;
and when, afterward, laymen were admitted
to assist, it was required that they
should, from their good conduct, be worthy
to represent the congregation of God's people,
and take the lead in this part of their
worship; and, above all, it was required
that they should understand the dignity of
the trust committed to them, and should
neglect no preparation necessary to acquit
themselves respectably. These laymen hold
in the Lord's house the first place after its
consecrated ministers; and they should not
be allowed to continue in it unless they
showed themselves the zealous auxiliaries
of the priest who takes the lead in the name
of the Church."</p></blockquote>

<p>If we adhered to the character of
the music desired by the Church, we
should never be obliged to look elsewhere
than to Catholics&mdash;to those
who will sing from the heart as well
as with the lips&mdash;for worthy auxiliaries
of the priest in this devout and sacred
office.</p>

<p>This leads us to consider the selection
and the training of competent
and worthy singers. We are aware
that the destruction of the Protestant
singing-gallery, the restoration of the
choir, and adoption of the Gregorian
music is not so simple a matter of
choice with the pastors of churches
that it can be effected at once by an
order issued to the organist, and the
provision of cassocks and surplices
for as many men as can be paid to
wear them and sing the music which
befits such clerically-habited chanters.
Such singers as we ought to have for
our holy offices are not to be had to-morrow,
even for money. Nor, even
supposing such worthy persons, possessing
proper vocal acquirements,
were to be had by paying for them,
would they be able to sing our sacred
music in a style that would be even
tolerable. Gregorian chant is not
easy of execution, as some imagine.
It needs not only good vocal culture
to render its musical phrases with precision,
but also no small amount of
intellectual and moral training to give
its true expression.</p>

<p>We say, good vocal culture. By
which we must not be understood to
mean that finished vocalization which
distinguishes the professional opera-singer,
or those few amateurs whose
voices of natural sweetness and power
have received first-class cultivation.
All Gregorian music is included within
an octave and a half, with rare exceptions.
Great compass is therefore
not required. The first requisite is
the ability to modulate the different
phrases with distinctness and facility.
There are few men or boys who could
not be taught in a short time to acquire
this primary qualification of the
choir-singer. On this head there is
little or no difficulty. But as every
one who can read English is not able
to give a proper <i>reading</i> of Shakespeare,
so not every one who can sing
the gamut or its intervals is able to
sing the phrases of Gregorian chant.
The reader of Shakespeare needs
practice in tone, in inflection, in the
art of speaking with sublimity, with
pathos, with joy, etc. Then he must
study the works of the great poet,
must master his style, and with much
painstaking and oft-repeated rehearsals
learn to imitate the various characters,
their mode of behavior, and
peculiarity of utterance. The holy
melodies of the Church possess an
admirable variety of religious expression,
and share with all her rites and
ceremonies in that sacred dramatic
form which clothes them with such remarkable
spiritual power and beauty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_749" id="Page_749">[749]</a></span>
It is plain, therefore, that the
singer must not only understand what
he is singing, but must make a study
of the different phrases, in order to
discover their true expression.</p>

<p>But besides all this intellectual attention
to and appreciation of the
chant, the slightest reflection will
show one that a certain degree of
moral training is equally requisite.
The capital point always to be kept
in mind is that the music of the
Church is her divine prayer. The devout
soul, though endowed with a
voice of only medium capacity, will
render these prayerful melodies with
far greater effect than a first-class artist
who sings only from the lips, while
his heart remains unmoved by the
words and the song. We are all conscious
of the different effect produced
upon us by the chanting of the <i>Preface</i>
and the <i>Pater</i> by different priests.
As a few simple words preached to
us by a priest of an interior and devout
life will go deeper into our souls,
and bring forth greater spiritual fruit,
than the most brilliant oratory from
one of less religious mind, so a devout
singer will give to his song a
nameless charm, and edify those who
listen to him far more than one who
is his superior in musical attainments,
but inferior to him in piety. It is
Father Lallemant, we think, who said,
"An interior man will make more
impression on hearts by a single word
animated by the Spirit of God, than
another by a whole discourse which
has cost him much labor, and in
which he has exhausted all his powers
of reasoning."</p>

<p>Our argument, therefore, for the
restoration of the church music, and
the banishment of concert music,
implies the restoration, as well, of
the church singer, and the close of
our engagement with the concert
artists, or the more wretched substitute
of concert amateurs. We are
sure that in every congregation in this
country it would be possible to find
a sufficient number of men and boys,
possessing all the necessary qualifications,
intellectual, moral, and vocal,
for the decent and edifying singing
of the church offices, who might be
prepared after a few weeks' instruction
for the duties of the chorister. We
may be permitted to add, that our
opinion is not mere theory, but based
upon the observation and experience
of many years in the practical duties
of the ministry, during which the direction
of the music has generally
fallen to our care. If we are not
able to refer our readers to a practical
illustration of what we assert, it
is simply because we also, as we said
before, have been straitened and hampered
by this incubus of Protestant
tradition. Until we can get rid of
this, we can do nothing. Until the
people, at present profoundly ignorant
on this head, learn what constitutes a
Catholic choir and where it ought to
be located in the church, we shall
never be able to get any thing but
concert music. They must learn that
the present order of things prevalent
among us is abnormal, unrecognized
by the ritual, and quite as foreign
to the Catholic standard as would be
the preaching of a priest from the
pulpit in a citizen's dress. We may
be obedient to the strict law of the
Church which forbids female singers
in choir, and find a sufficient number
of men and boys to take their places,
who will scramble into the organ-gallery,
and, under cover of the curtains,
talk, laugh, chew tobacco, eat candy,
draw caricatures on the walls and on
the covers of the singing-books, and
sit with crossed legs and chairs tilted
backward even during the elevation
and benediction&mdash;all this we will get
as of old; but, until the <i>gallery</i> comes
down, until the singers are properly
vested, and marched with proper ecclesiastical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_750" id="Page_750">[750]</a></span>
decorum into the sanctuary,
or to such a place as near to it as
the present inconvenient arrangement
of our modern churches will permit,
we shall never get a <i>church choir</i>.</p>

<p>This is our first point: let us have
male singers who will understand from
the dress and deportment they assume,
for the time being, as well as
from the position they occupy in the
church, that their office as a church
singer is a sacred one, of high character,
and worthy of special respect
as being associated officially with the
priestly celebrations at the altar. No
sooner shall we have succeeded in
teaching the people this true Catholic
tradition, than our youth will at once
look upon the function of choir-singer
as an enviable position, and the
effort to make themselves worthy to
be thus associated with the clergy in
the divine offices will necessarily do
much toward elevating their moral
tone, and inspiring a devout Catholic
spirit. We shall, very probably, not
obtain all we desire at a first trial.
Many of those whom we may select
will likely disappoint us. This is in
the nature of things. It is not every
one who is selected as a student for
the priesthood that proves to have a
vocation. For ourselves, we apprehend
little difficulty if our own purpose
be well determined, and we give
to the whole subject of church music
a little serious study and reflection.</p>

<p>As to the source from which our
churches are to obtain a regular supply
of choristers, we frankly speak
our mind, and say that the Catholic
choir system would appear to involve
necessarily the formation of what is
known in France as the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maitrise</i>, or
choir-school, in which are admitted
boys of good moral character possessing
sufficient vocal capability, and
of a grade of intelligence to render
it worth while to bestow upon them
a more refined education than they
might obtain in the ordinary school.
This special education given in the
choir-school tends not only to improve
and elevate the character of
the boys, but fits them as well to attain
a better position in life than they
could have hoped for without it. But
this is a subject we can afford to defer
to future consideration.</p>

<p>Supposing that we have come to
the determination to conform our
church music at once to the true standard,
how shall we procure the necessary
choristers? Let us see what we
need. For large churches, or what
are large churches to us, there should
be at least four trained voices of men&mdash;two
tenors and two baritones; and
not less than twelve boys. These,
equally divided on either side of the
sanctuary, would make a better double
chorus than might at first be supposed.
The boys can be had for the
asking; but the four men will not easily
be obtained without a reasonable
salary. The advertisement for them
should, of course, conclude with the
warning, "None but practical Catholics
need apply." We do not propose
to put the cassock and surplice
upon persons whose very appearance
in that garb would disedify the people.</p>

<p>For this choir we need a competent
teacher. Advertise for him, and
it is not unlikely we shall find such
a one, or one who will quickly fit
himself for that office, in one of the
four hired singers. We do not hesitate
to say that, even in this great city
of New York, there are at present
very few music teachers who are fully
competent to teach the proper method
of chanting the Vesper psalms
alone, not to speak of those other important
portions of the divine offices
whose expression is more difficult to
render. But there is no want that is
not quickly met with the supply. If
we want such a teacher, and are willing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_751" id="Page_751">[751]</a></span>
to pay him, then the subject of
the church chant will at once engage
the attention and study of professors
of music whose business it is to teach.
At this moment it is generally understood
(and not without reason) by all
organists and directors of choirs that
our Catholic churches need performers
and teachers who can come recommended
as well versed in "the
masses," as they are called.</p>

<p>As a consequence, these gentlemen
devote all their energies to the study
and practice of such compositions,
and to the science of directing a mixed
chorus. We do the musical profession
the justice of believing its
taste to be quite at variance with the
taste of the public it serves; and, although
we are prepared to see our
choir-director shrug his shoulders and
return us a wondering look when we
propose our reformation to him, still,
when we shall have given him to understand
that we ourselves know what
we want, and are prepared to count
the cost, we feel assured that he will
readily come into our views, and enter
upon this new field of musical
culture with more zest than he has
hitherto shown in the conduct of music,
for the most part, despicable even
in his own eyes. We will engage him
to produce church music in first-class
church style. We will aid him by
causing an organ of sufficient size to
be erected near the choristers in the
vicinity of the sanctuary. Should he
crave for a larger chorus, we will seek
out a number of young men, from
eighteen to twenty-five years of age,
whom we have in our eye, whose interest
will not fail of being excited in
this subject to which we give our pastoral
solicitude, and whose social and
moral character we feel assured will
be benefited by being associated with
our regular choir as volunteers. If
we might be permitted the use of an
expressive vulgarism, we would say
that our young men, as a class, are
"spoiling" for some church work.
How many would not feel both honored
and gratified by an invitation
to labor with us in renovating and
restoring the grand offices of the
Church to their pristine order and
sublime harmony! We manage to
associate together a few of our young
men in various confraternities and
associations, and drive a few more
into the ranks of the society of St.
Vincent de Paul; but the greater number,
upon whom depend the future
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit</i> of our church in this country,
and upon whose attachment to
all that concerns the dignity and devout
character of our religious services
hang the fortunes of our faith,
are left unnoticed and unemployed.
We propose this subject of the reformation
of church music to them as a
labor of love and true Catholic devotion,
worthy of their hearty coöperation,
and tending to their own intellectual
refinement and moral elevation. We
are not wholly unacquainted with the
souls of this class of our brethren in
the faith, and will answer for the response
that will be made to our sentiments
by any Catholic young man
whose eye may chance to fall on
these lines.</p>

<p>Now as to the matter of proper
church music-books. Speaking as
one who has been made wise through
suffering, we rejoice at the prospect
of seeing all our "Catholic choir-books,"
"Morning and Evening services,"
and such trash, bundled up
and sent to the paper-makers. We
are at liberty to state that, while the
present &OElig;cumenical Council may allude
only incidentally to the subject
of church music, by confirming the
ancient canons made in regard to it,
the Congregation of Rites is already
preparing an authorized version of
the Roman Gradual and Vesperal, and
that his Holiness will issue a brief in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_752" id="Page_752">[752]</a></span>
which he will strongly exhort all the
bishops to adopt it. As soon as this
desire of the head of the Church shall
have been brought home to us in the
proper way, those whose hands are
waiting direction will lose no time in
preparing an edition of this work in
musical notation, and harmonized for
the use of organists, an imperative
need for the great majority of our
players and singers, to whom the
learning of the plain chant scale and
clefs would be a labor equal to that
of acquiring the knowledge of a foreign
language. Our choir-boys, and
the generation of choristers who shall
succeed them, can be taught the plain
chant notation from the first, and will
find it much simpler, and more expressive
in typography, than the modern
musical scale, with its varied
keys in flats and sharps.</p>

<p>A word as to the comparative cost
of the authorized church music and
the concert music which now replaces
it. It will be seen that we have
advised the engagement of four professional
singers, and the services of a
special teacher both for them and the
chorus of boys. This teacher, in
most cases, would be one of the four
salaried choristers or the organist.
It will be seen at once, by those interested,
that even in the beginning
we shall not be put to any greater
expense than we are already at for
our music. In the matter of music-books
there will be an immense saving
for those churches which possess
a large chorus. We ourselves own a
musical library which has cost us several
thousands of dollars; and to tell
the honest truth, not one half of it is
of the least practical use even with
the present liberty we enjoy (?) of
singing what we please. A set of
Graduals and Vesperals, with a suitably
harmonized version for the use of the
organist, will suffice under our new
and better <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i>.</p>

<p>We cannot close this portion of our
remarks without calling attention to
the great boon which this wholesome
musical reform will prove to country
churches. In our large cities, we
have been able to perform in our
churches music which is a tolerable
imitation of the same style of harmony
as given at the opera and on the
boards of the concert-hall to paying
audiences. As a rule, we have not
charged any price of admission to
our ecclesiastical concert offices, and
our second-rate performances have
therefore been justly treated with
great leniency by the critics. But
as you leave the city and enter
churches in our small towns and country
villages, you hear an imitation of
the city fashion which is no longer
tolerable. One must have advanced
far into the spiritual ways of devout
contemplation to endure the horrible
cacophony without suffering indescribable
tortures of soul. Then again,
there are numberless village churches
where never a sound of music, profane
or religious, is heard. Yet, if
these muse-abandoned people were
disabused of their ignorant belief that
our popular florid music is the only
music possible or fit for the Catholic
Church, and learned that, even if too
poor to purchase an organ, they could
have with a little study and practice
all the music for the divine offices
executed in a devout and decent style,
it would not be long until the invariable
low Mass on all Sundays and
festivals, and the recitation of the Rosary
in lieu of Vespers, would be a
rare exception, instead of being, as it
is now, not far from the rule. As an
example, we confess extraordinary, of
the gross ignorance of our country
people concerning church music, we
remember being told by a Catholic
woman who had never been out of
her own little village, that one reason
why she was certain of the falsehood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_753" id="Page_753">[753]</a></span>
of the Protestant religion was because
<i>they had music and singing in their
churches</i>!</p>

<p>We do not expect to see our suggestions
or opinions accepted without
question or criticism. We are fully
aware that we have been arguing in
the face of inexperience and deep-seated
prejudice. We console ourselves,
however, with the thought that
what we have decried as abnormal,
irregular, and inadequate for the music
of the Church, is in itself so inconsistent,
incomplete, and disordered,
that it does not deserve even the
name of a system. Based upon a
false principle, the amusement of an
audience, it will ever fail of recognition
or encouragement at the hands
of the holy Church, whose sole object
proposed in all her divine functions is
<em>prayer</em>. The faithful come to church
to pray. A church ought by its very
form and interior dispositions surround
the worshippers with an atmosphere
of prayer. It ought to feel like
a holy place; and nothing about it
should smack of the theatre, or the
halls of assembly for secular purposes.
All that is presented to the gaze of
the faithful in these sanctuaries of
God, whether it be the ceremonies
associated with the Holy Sacrifice and
other offices, or the statues, pictures,
and decorations which meet the eye,
ought to be of such a character as
to excite the spirit of prayer. All this
we understand full well. Why, then,
are we so dull of hearing that we cannot
also distinguish the accents of
prayer from the sounds which speak
of war, of love, of the dance, of jocularity,
and, for those who have ears to
hear, of the grossest sensuality? Let
us disabuse ourselves of the notion
that our people wish to hear what
is popularly styled "fine music" in
church. It is a very great mistake.
They not only frequent the church
services in the special intention to
pass the time there in prayer, but also
heartily desire to have their weary,
world-tossed souls helped by decorously
performed ceremonies, by good,
earnest preaching, and by devout,
prayerful music, in awakening in their
hearts true religious emotion and
thoughts of heavenly things.</p>

<p>This is our sole plea for reform in
our music, it being, without doubt,
also the "mind" of the Church. She
is in no sense opposed to secular music,
any more than she is to secular
painting, sculpture, and architecture,
unless they be debased and made to
minister to base passions. She who
sanctifies all that is true and noble in
human nature is far from discouraging
or condemning the legitimate expression
of those arts which can exert
so much power in the instruction, elevation,
and refinement of the intellect
and heart. But none so wise as she
to detect their weakness, and warn
society against the moral evils which
result from their prostitution to the
service of the devil. One of the destructive
faults justly charged against
modern art, and notably of music, is
its misapplication. A want of harmony
in the relation of an art to the
nature and object of the thing to be
expressed or illustrated by it, is the
signal for its own enervation and the
corruption of what it should purify
and strengthen; which is the teaching
alike of philosophy and experience.</p>

<p>"A tale out of time," says the wise
man, "is like music in mourning;"
and the converse of the proverb, is
equally true&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"The sweetest strains of music<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do but jar upon the soul, and set<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The very teeth on edge, if but the heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath not a mind to hear it."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Whence our conclusion. In the
house of God, whose "house shall be
called the house of prayer," no other
song must be heard but the song of
prayer, that melody consecrated to all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_754" id="Page_754">[754]</a></span>
that we have that is highest and holiest,
which lifts the soul above the frivolities
and sensualities of this world
and of time, and transports it in spirit
into the regions of the heavenly, and
before the throne of the majesty of
the Eternal.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE IRON MASK.</h2>


<p>This subject, so inexhaustible, so
interesting on account of the unfathomable
mystery that surrounds
it, has again been brought to our
notice by some recent discoveries.
Whether they amount to any thing
or not, remains to be seen; but they
are at least singular, and may stimulate
the curiosity of the erudite, and
even that of simple amateurs.</p>

<p>A young writer, M. Maurice Topin,
so says a contemporary French
paper, who has obtained a prize of
six hundred dollars from the French
Academy for his beautiful book, entitled,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L'Europe et les Bourbons sous
Louis XIV.</i>, has been diving into old
papers among the public archives, and
says he has at last found out the true
name of the unfortunate prisoner of
the Iron Mask.</p>

<p>Following the advice of his uncle,
M. Mignet, he has addressed a letter
to the President of the Academy of
Moral and Political Science, in which
he incloses his secret&mdash;sealed, however&mdash;and
says it must not be unsealed
without his order.</p>

<p>So some day soon, perhaps, we
shall solve the enigma that has perplexed
the world for over two centuries.</p>

<p>A monk has lately died, too, somewhere
in a French monastery, leaving
papers testifying that he was the true
Iron Mask. Some say he was deranged.
Perhaps so; and perhaps we
would rather such might have been
the case. A real <i>bona fide</i>, two-hundred-year-old
mystery must not succumb
to this practical age of would-be
common sense. We could never
find such another, so we must content
ourselves with reviving old facts and
eliciting further researches.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He who was called, under the reign
of Louis XIV., <i>The Man with the Iron
Mask</i>, was not permitted to wear so
pretty a covering as that which preserved
the complexion of the Empress
Poppée; and the painters who have
represented him with a sort of lowered
visor, a rampart of iron on his face,
have made a great mistake.</p>

<p>The unknown prisoner, to whom
nobody approached, and nobody
spoke, wore a mask of velvet.</p>

<p>The question is not decided upon
what he wore on his way from the
Isle Ste. Marguerite to the Bastille.
Some say his chin was inclosed in a
network of steel, to permit him to
eat, while the upper part of his face
was concealed in the mask of iron.</p>

<p>But this is a mystery, and his early
training no less so.</p>

<p>He had been incarcerated a long
time at Pignerol, the château of which
had served for a prison of state, and
since 1632 had belonged to France.
The inhabitants still show a large dismantled
tower that overlooks the
town, and give the tradition concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_755" id="Page_755">[755]</a></span>
the Iron Mask and Fouquet, who
were here confined.</p>

<p>They showed the chamber in 1818
that these poor victims inhabited.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After the taking of the Bastille,
indications of the Iron Mask were
sought for among the registers of this
place of detention; but the largest
book of records was sadly torn, and
the folio numbered one hundred and
twenty, coinciding with the year 1698,
the epoch of the incarceration of the
prisoner, had been taken away.</p>

<p>Later, a leaf was discovered among
the papers of a former governor, and
here it is, as historians have given it
to us:</p>

</table></div>

<p>The date of the entrance of the Iron
Mask into the Bastille is preserved at
present in the library of the arsenal;
and we read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Thursday, the 18th of September, 1698,
at three o'clock in the afternoon, Monsieur
de St. Mars, governor of the Bastille, arrived
for the first time from the Isles of Ste.
Marguerite and Honorat, bringing with him,
in his own litter, an old prisoner he had
guarded at Pignerol. His name was not
given; he wore a velvet mask; and was first
placed in the tower of the Bayimère to await
the night, when I was to conduct him myself,
at nine P.M., into the tower of the Bertandière,
to the third-story room which, by
order of M. St. Mars, I had completely furnished
for his reception. In conducting
him to the said room, I was accompanied
by M. Rosarges, who was to serve and
guard the prisoner at the government expense."</p></blockquote>

<p>Here let me state that Du Junca
was not a surname given to the prisoner,
but the name of the lieutenant
of the king at the Bastille. The prisoner
was called Marchiali.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The young historian who pretends
to have discovered the true name of
the Iron Mask has, without doubt, studied
all the evidences up to the time
of Voltaire, who also knew more than
he was willing to impart.</p>

<p>He knew the story of the silver plate
connected with the Isle Ste. Marguerite,
whose governor was charged
by Louis XIV. in person not to permit
the prisoner to communicate with
any one.</p>

<p>St. Mars waited on him himself,
and took the dishes from the cooks at
the door of the apartment, so that no
one ever saw the face of the captive.</p>

<p>One day the Iron Mask threw a
silver plate out of the window into the
water-course beneath. A fisherman
picked it up and brought it back to
the governor.</p>

<p>"Have you read what is written
on the bottom of this silver plate?"
asked the governor.</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied the fisherman;
"I cannot read."</p>

<p>This reply saved the poor man,
who doubtless would have paid with
his liberty, and even his life, for the
possession of the terrible secret, if he
had been sufficiently educated to have
discovered it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another historian, the Abbé Papon,
does not believe that the governor
said to the fisherman, "Go; you are
happy in not being able to read!"
He states that, instead of a silver
plate, the mysterious prisoner used a
white shirt, covered from one end to
the other with the written history of
his life.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_756" id="Page_756">[756]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I had," said he, "the curiosity to
enter the chamber of the unfortunate
man. It was lighted only by a window
to the north, inclosed in a thick
wall and cased by three gratings of
iron placed at equal distances. This
window overlooked the sea. I found
in the citadel an officer of the French
company, about sixty-nine years old.
He told me that his father had often
told him in secret that a watchman
one day perceived under the window
of the prisoner something white floating
on the water.... It was a
very fine shirt, plaited with negligence,
and upon which the prisoner had
written from one end to the other.</p>

<p>"The watchman took means to recover
it, and carried it to M. de St.
Mars, the governor of the Isle Ste.
Marguerite.</p>

<p>"He protested that he had read nothing;
but two days afterward he was
found dead in his bed."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is said that the Regent of Orleans
left the secret of the name of the Iron
Mask with his daughter. We give
what he related to her, this authority
being a pretended governor of the interesting
captive. His account may
be found in the archives of the English
government:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The unfortunate prince that I raised
and guarded," said he, "until the end of
my days, was born the 6th of September,
1638, at eight o'clock in the evening, during
the supper of the king, Louis XIII. His
brother, now reigning, Louis XIV., had
been born in the morning at twelve o'clock,
during the dinner hour of his father; but as
the birth of the first child was splendid and
brilliant, that of his brother was most sad
and carefully concealed; for the king, advised
by the midwife that the queen would
bring forth a second child, caused to remain
in her chamber the chancellor of France,
the midwife, the first almoner, the confessor
of the queen, and myself, to be witnesses
of what might happen, and of what he would
do, if this child should be born alive."</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Actors have for many years studied
carefully the costume of <i>The Man
with the Iron Mask</i> and he who played
in the drama by this name, M.
Lockroy, is still alive. He personated
the prisoner, and was clothed in
black velvet, with black stockings and
buckled shoes. He wore the double
mask of velvet with steel springs over
his lips.</p>

<p>In this piece, that all Paris went to
see, Chilly represented Louis XIII.;
Delaistre, M. de St. Mars; and Ligier,
who was afterward the Duke of Gloucester
and the Louis XI. of Casimir
Delavigne, took the part of the protector
of the unfortunate recluse.</p>

<p>Again, under another name&mdash;<i>The
Prisoner of the Bastille</i>&mdash;the same story
has been dramatized, and fresh interest
added by an imaginary conversation
between the captive and Louis
XIV.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is easily seen that the most general
opinion of the Iron Mask considered
him the twin-brother of Louis
XIV., kept out of the way for fear of
future trouble and collision in the
government of France.</p>

<p>Some authors affirm, too, that he
must have been deformed, his face
distorted, or with some physical infirmity
that it was necessary to conceal.</p>

<p>Others have thought that the brother
of Louis XIV., being born the
last, was the elder by right, if the
opinion of physicians and legislators
is to be consulted; and that the tenderness
inspired by the first born of
the two brothers occasioned the act
of ostracism, which history has sought

<p>In 1837, there appeared a remarkable
dissertation on the Iron Mask, by
M. Paul Lacroix. He says that he
who bore the name of Marchiali during
his lifetime was not the twin-brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_757" id="Page_757">[757]</a></span>
of Louis XIV., and not even a
son born clandestinely of the queen,
but the superintendent, Fouquet himself.</p>

<p>But the Iron Mask has in turn been
believed to be Fouquet, Marchiali,
Arwediks, and other people who disappeared
about that time.</p>

<p>He, however, who was called Marchiali,
and who entered the Bastille
the 18th of September, 1698, died
there suddenly the 19th of November,
1703.</p>

<p>Very singular precautions were taken
after his decease.</p>

<p>The body and face were mutilated,
and every thing composing his furniture
was burned; even the doors and
windows of his bedroom. The silver
he used was melted. The walls of
his apartment were scraped and re-whitened.</p>

<p>He was buried the 20th of November,
1703, in the Church of St. Paul,
under the name of Marchiali.</p>

<p>Time has not given the answer to
this lugubrious enigma, and we fear M.
Maurice Topin has failed to solve it.</p>

<p>But let us give him his meed of
praise for having consecrated his nights
to seeking for documents, comparing
dates, and confronting the evidence
of the most celebrated writers on the
subject.</p>

<p>Honor to the brave historian whom
the night of time does not intimidate,
and who is willing to grope among
the shades of the past for what is hidden,
and above all a secret of the
state!</p>

<p>Among all the victims of the old
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régimes</i>, <i>The Man with the Iron Mask</i>
was the most interesting.</p>

<p>This popular story was in every
mouth the day of the taking of the
Bastille.</p>

<p>If he had lived until 1789, would
it have been a pretender to the crown,
or simply a suspected prisoner, that
the people would have delivered?</p>

<p>We wait for M. Topin to answer.</p>

<h2>THE GREEK SCHISM</h2>


<p>The Eastern Church has for the Catholic
an attraction which centuries
of separation have not been able to
overcome. We look on its glories as
our own, and we deplore its misfortunes
as of our own household. We
have a common faith, the same sacraments,
the same sacrifice, essentially
the same devotional practices.
Between us stands the barrier of a
schism which has lasted for centuries.
It is of this schism, its origin, its history,
that we propose to treat in this
article.</p>

<p>To understand clearly the causes
that precipitated so large and flourishing
a portion of the church into a
deadly schism, it is necessary to consider
the relations of the bishops
of Constantinople to Rome and the
other great patriarchal sees, from the
time when Constantine the Great placed
the capital of his empire on the
shores of the Bosphorus. The Bishop
of Byzantium was then a suffragan
of the Metropolitan of Heraclea.
But when, with the presence of
the emperor, the splendor and the
reality of the capital had been transferred
to the new Rome, the bishops
of Byzantium became very important
personages. They were, in fact, the
ordinary medium of communication
between the emperor and the other
prelates of the Eastern Church. Not
content with the great influence naturally
arising from their vicinity to
the court, they desired a style and
title suitable, as they thought, to the
dignity of the city of their residence.
The second general council (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 381)
gratified their wishes by a canon
which decreed that the bishops of
Constantinople, <i>because it was the new
Rome</i>, should have precedence over
all other prelates, after the Bishop of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_759" id="Page_759">[759]</a></span>
Rome. But this council has been
held to be general only in its dogmatic
definitions, since, as St. Gregory the
Great<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
says, "The Roman Church
neither has received nor accepted of
its decrees or acts, with the exception
of its definitions against Macedonius."
In point of fact, it was a local synod,
neither convoked nor presided over
by the holy see, and has been called
&oelig;cumenical only on account of the
subsequent approbation of its dogmatic
decrees by the same supreme
authority. Its canon about the dignity
of the Bishop of Constantinople
thus fell to the ground. Pope Boniface
I. (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 418-422) insisted on the
observance of the order of dignity
between the great sees established
by the Council of Nice, according to
which Alexandria held the second,
and Antioch the third place. The
same rule was adopted by Xystus III.
and other pontiffs. However, the
powerful prelates of the imperial city
did not relinquish their ambitious
views. The general council of Chalcedon
(<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 451) passed two canons,
by which it permitted any cleric who
felt himself aggrieved to appeal to
the see of "the imperial city, Constantinople;"
and besides, enacted the
celebrated twenty-eighth canon in
which the unfortunate principle that
afterward led to schism was more
openly avowed. Having cited the canon
of the first council of Constantinople,
it reaffirms it. "Since the fathers
have justly granted privileges
to the see of ancient Rome, because
it was the imperial city, for the same
reason the fathers of the second general
council granted equal privileges
to the episcopal throne of new Rome,
rightly judging that the city which is
honored by the imperial presence and
the senate, and enjoys equal privileges
with old Rome, should in ecclesiastical
matters also be equally distinguished,
retaining, however, the second
place;" and then confers ecclesiastical
jurisdiction on the Bishop
of Constantinople over the dioceses
in Pontus, Asia Minor, and Thrace,
and those that might afterward be
"erected among the barbarians." The
fathers, however, petitioned St. Leo
the Great for the approval of this regulation,
alleging the good of religion
as their motive. But that great pontiff
promptly "annulled their action
by the authority of St. Peter," as contrary
to the canon of Nice, remarking
at the same time that ecclesiastical
questions were not regulated on
the same plan as secular affairs, and
that the Bishop of Constantinople
ought to be satisfied with the imperial
privileges of his city, without disturbing
church discipline, and invading
the long-acknowledged rights of
others. The obnoxious canon is not
to be found in the most ancient and
best collections, though, in practice,
the bishops of Constantinople always
availed themselves of the privileges
it attempted to grant them.</p>

<p>This uncanonical usurpation gave
rise to a serious controversy toward
the end of the century. Acacius,
Bishop of Constantinople, relying on
the twenty-eighth canon of Chalcedon,
interfered in the election and
consecration of the patriarchs of Alexandria
and Antioch. He was also
accused and convicted of favoring the
Eutychian heretics. For these causes
he was condemned and deposed
by Pope Felix III. (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 484.) The
oriental bishops continued, however,
to retain his name in the commemoration
at mass, (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sacris diptychis</i>,) and
the popes, on this account, refused to
communicate with them, until the
pontificate of Hormisdas, when they
submitted to the holy see, erased the
obnoxious name from the sacred records,
and subscribed a formula of
faith, in which they professed their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_760" id="Page_760">[760]</a></span>
agreement with the synods of Ephesus
and Chalcedon, condemned Acacius
and others by name, acknowledged
all the dogmatic epistles of St. Leo,
and declared that in the apostolic see
is to be found "the true and entire
fulness of the Christian religion," and
that those "who did not agree with
the apostolic see were separated
from the communion of the Catholic
Church."</p>

<p>After this happy termination, with
one exception, no serious difficulty
on disciplinary questions occurred between
the two sees until the time of
Photius. Heresies, indeed, arose in
the Eastern Church; but both parties
appealed to Rome, and the Catholic
prelates and people always accepted
her judgment as final. The exception
to which we allude occurred under
the pontificate of Pelagius II. and St.
Gregory the Great, and affords a striking
instance of the different spirit that
animated old and new Rome. In the
year of our Lord 583, John, surnamed
<i>The Faster</i>, was called to the see of
Constantinople. Gregory, patriarch
of Antioch, being accused of grave
crimes, the Bishop of Constantinople
convoked a synod of the whole east,
and in his letters of convocation assumed
the title of <i>&oelig;cumenical</i>, or universal,
<i>patriarch</i>. Pope Pelagius II.
promptly condemned both the usurpation
of jurisdiction over the see of
Antioch and the newly-assumed title,
especially as John pretended to
convoke a general council, thus trenching
upon the rights of the apostolic
see. The controversy continued under
St. Gregory the Great, who exhorted
the bishops of Alexandria and
Antioch to resist this invasion of the
rightful dignity of their sees. He refused
for himself the high-sounding
title, though it had been given to his
predecessors by the great council of
Chalcedon, choosing the humbler designation
of <i>servant of the servants
of God</i>, which has ever since been
used by the Roman pontiffs in their
official documents. Cyriacus, the immediate
successor of The Faster, continued
to claim the obnoxious title,
until he was prohibited to do so by
the Emperor Phocas. But, as all
Phocas's decrees were annulled by
Heraclius, the bishops of Constantinople
resumed the offensive usage. It
is to be remarked, however, that they
always gave an explanation of the
title, which showed that they did not
intend to infringe on the primatial
rights of the Roman see. They disclaimed
any really universal jurisdiction,
claiming, at most, authority over
the whole east. Insufficient as such
an explanation was justly held to be
by the popes, it shows that even the
ambitious prelates of Constantinople,
greedy as they were of high titles
and extended jurisdiction, never, in
the early ages, dared to place themselves
on an equality with the bishops
of old Rome, the successors of St.
Peter in the government of the universal
church.</p>

<p>From these facts, it is also evident
that the real cause of dissensions between
Rome and Constantinople was
not, as alleged by Protestant historians,
following the lead of Mosheim,
the ambition of the pontiffs of Rome,
who were striving for mastery over
the whole church, while the bishops
of Constantinople were contending
for the rightful independence of the
eastern portion thereof. The supremacy
of the Roman see was recognized
by every general council before
the election of Photius, and all of
them were held in the east, composed
of eastern bishops, and guided by
eastern ideas and influence. The
very canons which attempted to give
high dignity to Constantinople, acknowledged
the primacy of Rome,
and asked only the second place for
the capital of the eastern empire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_761" id="Page_761">[761]</a></span>
while that of Chalcedon was formally
submitted to St. Leo, and his approbation
asked for it. When the most
illustrious prelate that ever governed
New Rome, St. John Chrysostom,
was unjustly treated, he appealed as
a matter of right to Pope Innocent I.,
and his appeal was sustained. When
heresy arose in the east, the orthodox
bishops of Constantinople always submitted
to the judgment of the holy
see, and sat in councils over which
its legates presided. The history of
the Nestorian, Eutychian, Monothelite,
and Iconoclast heresies affords
the most indubitable proofs that the
Eastern Church, including that of Constantinople,
always admitted the supreme
teaching and governing authority
of the see of St. Peter.</p>

<p>At the same time, it is plain that a
spirit was growing up which a bold,
ambitious man might easily use to
divide the unity of the church. The
second general council affirmed a fatal
principle when it wished to give
Constantinople the second place
among the great sees, <i>because it was
the new Rome</i>. This principle was
more fully and offensively developed
in the twenty-eighth canon of Chalcedon.
It appeared to imply that
the secular dignity of Rome was the
cause of its ecclesiastical primacy,
which should, consequently, follow
the imperial court. Not, indeed, that
the fathers of either council would
have admitted such a consequence.
They recognized the divinely established
primacy of the Roman see;
but they wished to gratify the emperor
of the day, and to second the desires
of the powerful prelates of the
imperial city, to whom many of them
were doubtless indebted for substantial
favors. But, unwittingly, they
planted the germ of schism, which at
the appointed time produced its terrible
fruit. This is the reason why the
pontiffs always opposed the uncanonical
pretensions of the prelates of
Constantinople; they defended not
their own, for they were not attacked,
but the rights of the sees of Alexandria
and Antioch, and jealously
guarded against encroachments, which
they saw too well were only the forerunners
of greater and more fatal
usurpations. The result, deplorable
as it has been, only confirms the accuracy
of their foresight, and justifies
their honest, fearless, incorruptible resistance.</p>

<p>The responsibility of the fatal step
to formal schism rests upon the celebrated
Photius. In the year 857, St.
Ignatius had been Patriarch of Constantinople
for a little more than a
decade. Of austere virtue and firm
character, he detested vice, and feared
not to denounce it even in high
places. The then reigning emperor,
Michael III., is compared by Gibbon
to Nero and Heliogabalus. "Like
Nero, he delighted in the amusements
of the theatre, and sighed to be surpassed
in the accomplishments in
which he should have blushed to excel....
The most skilful charioteers
obtained the first place in his
confidence and esteem; their merit
was profusely rewarded; the emperor
feasted in their houses, and presented
their children at the baptismal font;
and, while he applauded his own
popularity, he affected to blame the
cold and stately reserve of his predecessors."
After saying that he was
intemperate, licentious, and sanguinary,
the historian adds: "But the most
extraordinary feature in the character
of Michael is the profane mockery
of the religion of his country....
A buffoon of the court was invested
in the robes of the patriarch; his
twelve metropolitans, among whom
the emperor was ranked, assumed
their ecclesiastical garments; they used
or abused the sacred vessels of the
altar; and, in their bacchanalian feasts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_762" id="Page_762">[762]</a></span>
the holy communion was administered
in a nauseous compound of vinegar
and mustard. Nor were these
impious spectacles concealed from the
city. On the day of a solemn festival,
the emperor, with his bishops or
buffoons, rode on asses through the
streets, encountered the true patriarch
at the head of his clergy, and, by their
licentious shouts and obscene gestures,
disordered the gravity of the Christian
procession." While this promising
youth was thus enjoying himself
with sumptuous banquets, fast horses,
and degrading shows, his uncle, the
Cæsar Bardas, was the real emperor.
He, too, though a man of talents and
application to business, was of depraved
morals, and was at length excommunicated
by St. Ignatius, because he
had dismissed his wife, and attempted
to marry his own daughter-in-law.
From that moment the licentious Cæsar
determined on the ruin of the patriarch.
Toward the end of the year
857, the holy man was sent into exile
and imprisoned in a monastery, where
he positively refused to resign his
episcopal dignity. A synod of bishops
was held, who, through either
fear or favor, deposed Ignatius, and
elected Photius in his stead.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>If unhallowed ambition had not induced
Photius to usurp high ecclesiastical
dignity, his abilities, industry,
learning, and hitherto blameless life
might have obtained for him one of
the most honorable places in the history
of the Byzantine empire. But
from the day when, disregarding all
idea of right and of canonical restrictions,
he forced himself into the sanctuary,
his whole career was one of
chicanery, fraud, injustice, and finally
open schism. Even had the see of
Constantinople been vacant, his election
was null, because he was a layman,
and it was strictly prohibited by
the canons to elect laymen to the
episcopal dignity. He himself reënacted
these very canons, thereby practically
condemning his own election.
He held a high position in the imperial
court, was captain of the guards,
and principal secretary of the emperor,
and his energy and acknowledged
abilities might have obtained for him
still higher honors. But he was dazzled
by the splendor of the patriarchal
throne, and ascended it by an irregular
ordination. Within six days he received
all the orders of the church,
being consecrated bishop on Christmas
day, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 857. This hasty conferring
of sacred orders was also against
the canons. His consecrator was
Gregory, Bishop of Syracuse, who had
been tried by St. Ignatius, found guilty
of various grave crimes, and regularly
deposed in a legitimate synod. It
would be difficult to find an episcopal
election and ordination marred by
greater or more numerous irregularities.</p>

<p>Almost the first act of Photius was
to recognize the primacy of the holy
see. He sent legates to Pope Nicholas
I., who were charged to inform
the pontiff that Ignatius, worn out by
age and disease, had voluntarily renounced
the episcopal dignity, and
retired to a monastery; and that Photius
had been elected by all the metropolitans
and the entire clergy, and
forced by the emperor to accept the
dignity; he also sent an orthodox
profession of faith, hoping thus to deceive
the pontiff. The emperor, too,
sent his representative with a letter
requesting the pope to send legates
to Constantinople to restore discipline,
and finally root out the Iconoclasts.
But St. Nicholas was too
clear-sighted to be caught by the
wiles of the crafty Greek. He did,
indeed, send legates; but charged
them merely to examine into the case
of Ignatius, report fully thereon to the
apostolic see, and meanwhile to admit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_763" id="Page_763">[763]</a></span>
Photius to only lay communion. His
objections to the proceedings at Constantinople
were, first, that the deposition
of St. Ignatius was one of the
greater causes, which could not be
determined unless by the supreme
judgment of the holy see; and, secondly,
that, at all events, the election
of Photius, he having been at the
time a mere layman, was uncanonical,
and his consecration irregular.
On both points he was fully sustained
by ancient canons admitted in
the eastern as well as in the western
church. But he did not give a final
judgment; he merely ordered his legates
to make thorough inquiry into
the facts, and report thereon to himself.</p>

<p>They, however, proved unfaithful to
their high trust. As soon as they
arrived at their destination, they were
kept in honorable imprisonment for
the space of one hundred days, during
which they were allowed to see
no one but the friends of Photius.
Influenced partly by threats, partly
by gifts, they at last consented to
favor the cause of the usurper. He
then called together a synod, (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
861,) at which the legates presided.
Photius read what he called the letters
of the pope, but which were really
documents mutilated and interpolated
by his crafty hand. St. Ignatius
was then brought before the synod,
clad in the garb of a monk. He refused
to be judged by men all in the
interest of Photius, declared that he
appealed to the pope, and quoted in
his favor the fourth canon of the
Council of Sardica, which especially
recognizes the right of such appeal,
and the precedent of St. John Chrysostom.
But appeals to justice and
law are lost on a packed synod as
well as on a packed jury. False witnesses
were introduced, who swore
that he had not been legitimately
elected, but owed his elevation to intrusion
by the secular power; and on
this charge, true enough as against
Photius, he was deposed. One prelate
spoke in his behalf, Theodulus
of Ancyra, who was immediately
wounded by a ruffian, and thus enabled
with his blood to give testimony
to the right. The ceremony of
degradation then ensued; the venerable
patriarch was clothed with the insignia
of his order and dignity, and
one by one these were taken off him
by a deposed subdeacon who, at each
act, exclaimed aloud, <i>Indignus</i>, (unworthy,)
a word reëchoed by all present,
even the legates of the apostolic
see. He was then thrown into the
sepulchral vault of Constantine Copronymus,
tormented there in a most
terrible manner, nearly starved to
death, till, after two weeks, when he
was more dead than alive, a minion
of Photius, seizing his hand, forced
him to scratch a cross on a sheet of
paper. Over this cross the usurper
wrote a formal acknowledgment of
the justice of the sentence of the synod,
and sent it to the emperor as
the voluntary act of his victim. One
result of this fraud was the liberation
of the holy man, leave having been
accorded to him to retire to his mother's
property; but as he had reason
to fear more violence, he left Constantinople
in disguise, and took refuge
in the islands of the Propontis,
where he succeeded in baffling the
pursuit of his heartless and unscrupulous
enemies.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he sent a trustworthy
messenger to Rome to inform the
supreme pontiff of the terrible injustice
and indignities to which he had
been subjected in the presence and
with the approval of the legates of
the holy see. These worthies returned,
and informed the pope that Ignatius
had been canonically deposed
and Photius canonically installed.
Photius also wrote a letter remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_764" id="Page_764">[764]</a></span>
both for craftiness and elegance.
It contained neither an offence against
good style nor a word of truth. He
regretted his elevation, deplored the
burden imposed on his weak shoulders,
expressed his desire to conform
to the Roman discipline, and to govern
with ecclesiastical firmness, and
blended not unskilfully the arts of
flattery and sophistry. But Nicholas
was not to be deceived. He examined
the acts of the false synod,
found the fraud that had been committed,
and, calling a council at Rome,
restored Ignatius, deposed Photius,
and one of the traitor legates, who
publicly acknowledged his crime. As
the other was absent, his case was
put off until he could be heard in his
defence. The pontiff wrote also to
the emperor and Photius, announcing
his action in the premises, addressing
the latter merely as a layman. In a
later synod, (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 863,) having heard
from the representative of St. Ignatius
a full and well-authenticated account
of all the iniquity of Photius, the
pope deposed him from every grade
of the sacred ministry, and interdicted
him, under anathema, from which
he was not to be absolved unless at
the moment of death, from ever exercising
any act of the same, or from in
any way disturbing the legitimate patriarch,
Ignatius. He also deposed
all those who had been promoted by
the usurper, as well as the second legate,
who, by not appearing when
cited, had added to his other crimes
that of contumacy.</p>

<p>On hearing this news, Photius proceeded
to the dire act of formal schism.
He called a council, and formally excommunicated
Pope Nicholas. Only
one-and-twenty bishops followed him
in his impious course. The rest
cried out, "It is not just to pronounce
sentence against the supreme and
first pontiff, especially when it is an
inferior who pronounces it." To support
his action, he published a circular
letter to the patriarchs and bishops
of the East, in which he accused the
Roman see and the Western Church
of the following crimes: 1. that they
abstained from flesh on Saturday; 2.
that, during the first week of Lent,
they used milk and cheese; 3. that
the clergy in sacred orders observed
celibacy; 4. that they reserved the
right of conferring confirmation to bishops;
5. that, by a change in the
symbol, they pretended that the Holy
Ghost proceeded from the Son as
well as from the Father. No sensible
reader but will smile at the first
four charges; in relation to the fifth,
we shall only observe here that, as
first made by Photius, it did not allege
a mere breach of discipline, it involved
the crime of heresy. As thus proffered
it cannot be, as it is not, now
sustained by any orthodox Christian.</p>

<p>But the vices of the Emperor Michael
brought upon him that punishment
which has so often visited licentious
sovereigns. A conspiracy was
formed against him, and he was assassinated
in his own palace, (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 867.)
The chief of the conspirators, Basil
the Macedonian, ascended the vacant
throne. No one can defend the crime
of assassination; but the character of
the new emperor has been painted in
bright colors by the historian. Of
course, Photius fell with his patron,
and St. Ignatius was restored to his
see. Both the emperor and patriarch
hastened to notify St. Nicholas of this
happy event. But that great and
courageous pontiff had already been
called to his reward. The messengers
from Constantinople found Adrian
II. in the chair of Peter. He congratulated
them on the turn events
had taken, and, in order fully to heal
the schism of Photius, thought well
to have a general council held at
Constantinople. The emperor consented
and made the necessary dispositions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_765" id="Page_765">[765]</a></span>
The council was opened in
the church of St. Sophia, on Oct. 5th,
869, held ten sessions, and ended on
the last day of February following. The
legates of the pope, Donatus, Bishop
of Ostia, Stephen, Bishop of Nepè,
and Marinus, deacon of the Roman
Church, presided. Their names and
legatine authority are always mentioned
first in the acts. A high place of
honor was given to the emperor, as
protector of the church. The action
of the council was in entire conformity
with the instruction of the pope to
his legates. Ignatius was declared
legitimate patriarch, and Photius for
ever deposed from any clerical order.
He was, however, offered lay communion,
on condition that he should
retract and condemn, in writing, all
the iniquitous acts of his usurpation.
Proper measures were taken to remedy
the confusion created by his long
intrusion, and a profession of faith
was published, as well as twenty-seven
disciplinary canons. Photius was invited
to appear in person; but he refused,
denying the competency of the
synod to try him. To say the least,
it was as competent to try him as the
one he had called to try Ignatius.
The acts of the synod were subsequently
confirmed by Pope Adrian,
and it has always been admitted as
universal by the church.</p>

<p>Thus, for the seventh time in the
history of the church had a general
council been held in the East, composed
of eastern bishops, presided
over by the legates of the apostolic
see. At the first audience given by
the emperor to the legates of Adrian
II., the former said, "In the name
of God, we beg that the work be
strenuously carried on, that the scandals
caused by the wickedness of Photius
be dispelled, so that the long-wished-for
unity and tranquillity be
restored according to the decree of
the most holy Pope Nicholas." To
which they made answer, "For this
have we come hither; for this purpose
have we been sent hither; but we
cannot receive any one of your eastern
bishops into our council unless
we shall have received from them a
writing, according to a formula which
we have taken from the archives of
the apostolic see." And in the first
session their demands were complied
with. So that at the very time when
we are told by Protestant writers that
Photius was fighting for the rightful
independence of the see of Constantinople,
the supremacy of the see of
Rome was admitted in a general synod
by every eastern bishop that was
not a creature of Photius.</p>

<p>The attempted schism had thus
been vigorously repressed, and Photius
lived ten years in exile. But he
succeeded in gaining the esteem and
the favor of the monarch by an expedient
which has often before and
since met with the same reward. Basil
was of ignoble descent; Photius
made out a genealogy by which he
showed the family of the emperor to
be an offshoot of the Arsacides, "the
rivals of Rome, who had possessed
the sceptre of the east for four hundred
years." The acknowledged erudition
of the author lent probability
to the forgery; the pride of the monarch
was flattered, and his gratitude
awakened. On the death of St. Ignatius,
(<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 877,) Photius was recalled
to the see of Constantinople, and
the emperor immediately sent ambassadors
to Rome, begging the pontiff
to acquiesce in the election. He
declared that Photius had seen the
error of his ways, that his present elevation
would restore peace to the
church, and that all the bishops, even
those who had adhered to Ignatius,
petitioned for his confirmation. John
VIII., who then occupied the Roman
see, judged it expedient to gratify this
universal desire. He required, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_766" id="Page_766">[766]</a></span>
that Photius should in a public
synod acknowledge the decrees of
Popes Nicholas and Adrian, and the
general council, beg pardon for the
faults he had committed and the
scandals he had given, be absolved
from censure, and then, and not till
then, be acknowledged as Bishop of
Constantinople. He sent legates to
execute this decree of mercy. But
the pride of Photius would not brook
submission, and he resorted to his old
arts. Again the apostolic legates were
corrupted or intimidated; again Photius
mutilated the pope's letters; received
in a numerous synod, from the
legates themselves, the insignia of the
patriarchal dignity; and without any
opposition from them, if not with their
consent, the eighth council was abrogated,
and the acts of Popes Nicholas
and Adrian condemned.</p>

<p>On their return to Rome, the legates,
of course, reported that the
injunctions of the pontiff had been
strictly observed; but the pride of
Photius betrayed them. In his letter
he said he had fulfilled all the conditions
save that of begging pardon, because
he had done nothing to require
pardon. This led John to an investigation
which revealed to him how
shamefully he had been disobeyed.
He accordingly sent to Constantinople
the same Marinus, who had been
one of the legates to the general
council, ordering him to rescind every
thing that had been done against
his mandate. This brave and intelligent
man fully and faithfully performed
his duty, and was imprisoned for
thirty days; but as his constancy
could not be overcome, he was allowed
to return to Rome. Whereupon
Pope John, "ascending the pulpit,
taking the Gospel in his hands, in
the hearing of the whole congregation,
thus spake, 'Whoever doth not
hold Photius condemned by the sentence
of God, as the holy Popes Nicholas
and Adrian, my predecessors,
left him, let him be anathema.'" Photius,
however, remained in possession
as long as Basil lived. His son and
successor, Leo the Philosopher, albeit
educated by Photius, caused the sentence
of the pontiffs to be executed.
As the newly-elected prelate, Stephan,
had been ordained deacon by Photius,
a circumstance which rendered
him irregular, a dispensation was
prayed for from Rome. This was
granted by Pope Formosus, with a
saving clause that it should not be interpreted
against the condemnation
of Photius. Thus the schism was
healed for a time. Photius died in a
monastery, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 891.</p>

<p>We have entered into these details
to show on what grounds the origin
of the Greek schism rests. It was
not, we repeat it, a contest for supremacy.
New Rome had never even
claimed equality with the see of Peter.
Its bishops had never asked but the
second place. Could Photius have
obtained the confirmation of his election
from the pope, it is probable he
never would have rushed into schism.
It has been said that St. Nicholas was
too harsh with him. But had the
pontiff neglected to do justice to St.
Ignatius, the very writers who now
criticise him for severity, would have
blamed him with culpable weakness.
Indeed, John VIII. has met with
such censure. But how did Photius
repay his kindness? By fraud, by
the grossest insult to his predecessors,
and to an &oelig;cumenical council. It is
useless to speak of the erudition of
the usurper, or of his services to literature.
These, great though they be,
cannot palliate his crimes. The popes
defended oppressed virtue and the
canons of the church; Photius, having
failed to deceive, seduce, or intimidate
them, was driven to the desperate
resort of schism. A sceptic
like Gibbon may indeed scoff at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_767" id="Page_767">[767]</a></span>
whole dispute; but he who believes
that Christ established a church and
appointed a certain form of government,
must shudder as he reads of
the fatal action of one man, who, to
gratify his unhallowed ambition, began
a schism which has ended in the
ruin of some of the fairest portions of
Christendom. It is all very well in
the nineteenth century to talk of independent
national churches; the idea
was unheard of in the ninth. Else
why did Photius so persistently endeavor
to obtain the confirmation
of his election from the pope? His
own action condemns him; the whole
history of the Greek Church condemns
him; and the modern Greeks, who
are such sticklers for antiquity, stand
equally condemned.</p>

<p>The question of jurisdiction over
Bulgaria has been magnified by some
writers into a cause of the schism.
But the fact that Ignatius is revered
as a saint by the church, though up
to the time of his death he defended
the supposed rights of his see in this
regard, shows that, important though
the controversy doubtless was, it could
not have caused a separation. The
popes would, at most, have contented
themselves with protesting against
the usurpation, as they had done in
other cases. The ancient Illyricum,
of which Bulgaria is a part, undoubtedly
belonged to the Roman patriarchate.
So did Achaia. Both were
transferred to that of Constantinople
by a decree of the Iconoclast emperor,
Leo the Isaurian, in revenge
for the condemnation of his heresy
by the holy see. And these historical
facts have been alleged by the
schismatic bishops of modern Greece
to justify their forming themselves into
a national church, independent of
the patriarch of Constantinople. Says
one of their defenders, "An heretical
emperor took away these dioceses
from an orthodox pope to give them
to a patriarch who was a heretic like
himself."<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
The Bulgarian monarch
sent, almost at the same time, ambassadors
to the pope and to the Byzantine
emperor, asking for missionaries
to instruct himself and his people
in the Christian faith. Those sent
from Rome arrived first on the ground;
but the secular influence of Constantinople
was too great for them, and
they were sent back. Of course, the
popes protested against this outrage
against&mdash;be it carefully observed&mdash;not
their primatial, but their patriarchal
rights; but there is no reason
to suppose the controversy could
have given rise to schism. The
moderation of the pontiffs on such
questions, recorded on every page of
their history, is our warrant for this
assertion. It was only when some
primary law of the church was violated,
some gross injustice against innocent
persons committed, or their own
supremacy defied, that they felt themselves
obliged to resort to measures
of the last severity.</p>

<p>Photius was finally deposed in the
year 866. From that event for more
than a century there was peace between
old and new Rome. At length
one of the family of the usurper, Sergius,
was elevated to the see of Constantinople,
(<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 988.) He held a
council, excommunicated the popes,
and erased their names from the sacred
records. This outrage must never
have reached the ears of the holy
see. At least, we find no vestige of
any action taken by the popes concerning
it. Sergius was succeeded, in
1018, by Eustachius, who applied to
Pope John XIX. for permission to
adopt the title of <i>&oelig;cumenical patriarch</i>.
The request being refused by
the pontiff, his name was omitted
from the <i>diptychs</i> by the indignant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_768" id="Page_768">[768]</a></span>
prelate. He was succeeded by Alexius,
about whose attitude to the holy
see we can discover nothing in the
records of the age. In the year 1034,
Michael Cerularius was made bishop
of New Rome. Profane as well as
sacred historians represent him as a
proud, ambitious, and turbulent person.
He determined formally to revive
the schism inaugurated by Photius.
His principal accomplices were
Leo of Acrida, Metropolitan of Bulgaria,
and one Nicholas, a monk.
They issued a letter directed to John,
Bishop of Trani, in southern Italy,
giving their reasons why they no longer
wished to hold communion with
the Western Church, and addressed a
letter of similar import to the patriarchs
of the east. Most of these reasons
are so puerile that in reading
them one would be tempted to smile,
were it not for the thought that they
were used to create a deadly schism.
Such were the charges: that the Latins
used unleavened bread in the holy
sacrifice; that they did not abstain
from "strangled things and blood;"
that their monks ate swine flesh; that
their priests shaved off their beards;
that they did not sing <i>Alleluia</i> during
Lent; that they gave the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pax</i> before
the communion at mass; that their
bishops wore a ring. In the long arraignment
there is but one accusation
that the most prejudiced enemy of
the holy see can call serious, namely,
that of the addition of the <i>filioque</i> to
the symbol. As to this, we shall content
ourselves by relating afterward
how it was met, and the controversy
about it settled, in the Council of Florence.</p>

<p>St. Leo IX., who then occupied the
holy see, having been made acquainted
with the contents of the letter of
Cerularius, wrote a long and able answer,
in which he offered peace to
all who were really lovers of peace,
based, however, on the unity of the
church and the primacy of the Roman
see. Cerularius asked him to
send legates to Constantinople to settle
the pending difficulties. The pope
acquiesced, and sent two cardinals,
Humbert and Frederic, and the Archbishop
of Amalfi. Cerularius not
only refused to meet them, but endeavored
to prevent them from celebrating
the sacred mysteries in any of
the churches of Constantinople. The
legates having repeatedly warned him,
were obliged to excommunicate him
in the church of St. Sophia. He, in
turn, excommunicated the Roman
pontiff, and wrote letters to the patriarchs
of the great eastern sees with
the object of drawing them into the
schism. The answer of the Patriarch
of Antioch alone has been preserved.
He defends the Latins from many of
the charges raised by Cerularius, while
he admits some to be true; but he refuses
to join the wrong-headed bishop
of New Rome in his schism.</p>

<p>Most historians date from this period
the definitive separation of the
Greek Church from that of Rome.
It would be easy, however, to show
that communication was occasionally
kept up during the rest of the eleventh
and a portion of the twelfth centuries.
Practically, however, it may be said
that Cerularius separated new and
old Rome, especially as the Greeks
ever after held to two points he had
raised against the Western Church&mdash;the
addition of <i>filioque</i> to the symbol,
and the use of unleavened bread in
the holy sacrifice.</p>

<p>There were, doubtless, other causes
than these which rendered this great
schism so easy of accomplishment.
The ambition of the bishops of Constantinople
led them to be always on
the lookout for a plausible pretext
for a quarrel with Rome. Then the
Greeks felt deeply two great changes
in Europe&mdash;the loss of their dominion
in Italy, and the reëstablishment, as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_769" id="Page_769">[769]</a></span>
is called, of the empire of the west,
for both of which they chiefly blamed
the popes. This feeling made them
support without any very close examination
the cause of the bishops of the
imperial city. Then the memory of
Photius was revered as one of the
great names of New Rome. We
must add, in conclusion, the universal
effeminacy and corruption which has
left an indelible stain upon the unworthy
successors of Constantine and
Theodosius, and given to their government
the opprobrious but emphatic
name of the Low Empire.</p>

<p>But no honest man, much less no
churchman, can find in these causes
any excuse or palliation for schism.
Nor can such cause be found in the
personal relations of either Photius or
Cerularius with the holy see, much
less in the earlier history of the church
of Constantinople, as the facts collected
from authentic documents related
in these pages, we think, sufficiently
show.</p>

<p>The popular hatred of the Greeks
against the Latins was doubtless aggravated
by the establishment of the
Latin empire of Constantinople. Yet
it was the first sovereign of the restored
Greek empire that opened negotiations
for a reunion of the churches.
It is not for us to decide whether
Michael Palæologus was influenced
by motives of interest or of religion;
probably both had their weight with
him. In answer to his application,
Pope Clement IV. sent a profession
of faith according to the ancient formula,
promising to call a general
council to cement the union, provided
the Greeks would consent beforehand
to accept and sign this profession.
Gregory X. did call the council, (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
1272) for the triple purpose of the
union of the churches, aid to the
Christians struggling in the Holy
Land, and the reformation of discipline.
He sent nuncios to the Greek emperor
and the Patriarch of Constantinople,
inviting them to the synod, and
received a favorable answer from the
former. The council was opened at
Lyons on May 7th, 1274. There
were five hundred bishops present;
the pontiff presided in person. It
lasted three months, and six sessions
were held. At the third, the Greek representatives
appeared. Solemn high
mass was celebrated by the pope,
at which the <i>Credo</i> was sung in Latin
and Greek, the Greeks repeating
thrice the words, "Who proceedeth
from the Father and the Son." At
the next session were read the letters
of the Greek emperor and prelates.
Both contained most satisfactory statements
of their faith in the primacy of
the holy see by divine right over the
whole church. The prelates, moreover,
informed his holiness that, as
the Patriarch Joseph had opposed
the union, they had requested him to
withdraw into a monastery, to await
the result of the council, and that, if
he should refuse to accept it, they
would depose him and elect another
patriarch. Then the representatives
of the emperor, and those of the prelates,
in the name of their principals,
solemnly abjured the schism, acknowledged
the supremacy of the Roman
see, and took an oath never
again to infringe on it. A synodical
decree was passed defining the Catholic
doctrine on the procession of
the Holy Ghost, condemning those
who deny that he proceeds from the
Father and the Son, as well as those
who assert that he proceeds from
them as from <em>two principles</em>, not <em>one
principle</em>. The Greeks were then dismissed
with great honor, carrying
with them congratulatory letters to
the emperor and the prelates.</p>

<p>But this union did not last long.
Palæologus did indeed cause Joseph
to be deposed, and John Veccus to
be elected to the see of Constantinople.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_770" id="Page_770">[770]</a></span>
He also endeavored to enforce
the decree of union by severe penalties
against the recusants, and a synod
was celebrated by the patriarch, in
which the union was accepted. But
the clergy and the people obstinately
opposed any communion with the Latins;
the same feeling prevailed in
the emperor's household; and at last
he abandoned what he appears to
have considered a hopeless task. He
was excommunicated in 1281, by
Pope Martin IV., for favoring heresy
and schism. He, however, protested
his sincerity, and on his death was refused
Christian burial by his son and
successor, Andronicus, for the part he
had taken in the union of the churches.
The schism was thus reopened,
and the work of the Council of Lyons
produced no further fruit.</p>

<p>But when the Turks had reduced
the domain of the empire almost to
the walls of Constantinople, the wily
and faithless Greeks again turned
their eyes westward, and offered reunion
in the hope of obtaining succor.
It were foreign to our purpose to
trace the history of the controversy
between Pope Eugenius IV. and the
Council of Bâle. Suffice it to say,
that, to facilitate the coming of the
Greeks, who wished to meet in a city
near the Adriatic, he transferred the
council to Ferrara. On February 7th,
1438, the eastern fleet arrived at Venice,
bearing the Emperor John Palæologus,
Joseph, Patriarch of Constantinople,
the proctors of the other
eastern patriarchs, the Metropolitan of
Russia, and a great number of metropolitans,
bishops, abbots, and other dignitaries
of the Greek Church. They
were received with extraordinary
pomp and splendor. Thence they
went to Ferrara, where they arrived
in the beginning of March. The
council opened on April 9th. A delay
of four months was agreed on, to
enable the bishops of the Western
Church to take part in the proceedings.
Meanwhile, informal conferences
were held on the questions of
purgatory, and the beatitude of the
saints before the final day of judgment.
It was easily shown that the differences
between the two churches were merely
verbal, and did not affect the dogma.
The first solemn session was
held on October 8th, which was followed
by fifteen others in regular order.
In December, the council was
transferred to Florence, on account
of the appearance of the plague at
Ferrara. Nine sessions were held at
Florence, at the end of which the act
of union was solemnly adopted and
promulgated.</p>

<p>There is scarcely any thing more
interesting in the history of general
councils than the records of the discussions
so long and so ably carried on
in this synod. It is a common supposition
that the Latins resorted to
bribery and threats, the Greeks to
chicanery and bad faith, and thus an
understanding was arrived at. Nothing
could be further from the truth,
as the acts of the synod prove. Point
after point was discussed with marked
ability on both sides, and with peculiar
skill and pertinacity on the part
of the Greeks. At last, all, with
the exception of Mark, Archbishop of
Ephesus, yielded either to unanswerable
arguments or to clear explanations,
and then, all difficulties being
removed, the union was agreed to.
It is, of course, impossible in the brief
space of an article to relate these discussions
in detail. We shall briefly
refer to the principal point in dispute.</p>

<p>This was the addition of <i>filioque</i> in
the creed. The Latins insisted on
separating from the beginning the
two distinct points of dogma and discipline.
They asked the Greeks, first,
if they believed that the Holy Ghost
proceeded from the Father and the
Son, as from one principle of <i>spiration</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_771" id="Page_771">[771]</a></span>
They showed them that the fathers
of the Greek, as well as those
of the Latin church, had always
taught this doctrine. There was a
great deal of finessing on the part of
the Greeks; they examined their own
copies of the fathers, and found that
they had been correctly quoted by
the other side; and, at last, confessed
that they had been wrong in accusing
the Western Church of error. The
disciplinary question was argued with
a great deal of vigor. The Greeks,
of course, alleged the celebrated canon
of the Council of Ephesus, prohibiting
any addition to the symbol.
The Latin answer may be summed
up thus: This canon prohibits any
addition by private authority. But
<i>filioque</i> was added by the authority
of the head of the church. Again,
the canon prohibits any addition <em>contrary</em>
to the doctrine of the symbol;
but this addition is an explanation
and a complement of the doctrine of
Nice, and the very words (<i>and from
the Son</i>) have been taken from orthodox
fathers. Lastly, the addition
was not made lightly or without cause;
but a real necessity existed for it.
Finally, all the Greeks, but Mark of
Ephesus, returned this answer: "We
consent that you recite the addition
to the symbol, and that it has
been taken from the holy fathers; and
we approve it, and are united with
you; and we say that the Holy Ghost
proceeds from the Father and the
Son, as from one principle and cause."</p>

<p>This point being satisfactorily settled,
the other mooted questions were
soon adjusted, and on July 6th, 1439,
the act of union was read in solemn
session, in Latin by Cardinal Julian,
and in Greek by Bessarion, Archbishop
of Nice, who had been the leaders
on either side in the discussion.
It is in the name of "Eugenius, bishop,
servant of the servants of God, with
the consent of the most serene emperor,
and of the other patriarchs." The
pope, "with the approbation of the
sacred universal Council of Florence,"
defines, first, the dogma of the eternal
procession of the Holy Ghost
from Father and Son, as from one
principle, and by one spiration; secondly,
"that the explanatory words,
<i>and from the Son</i>, were lawfully and
reasonably added to the symbol, for
the sake of declaring the truth, and
by reason of imminent necessity;"
thirdly, that both leavened and unleavened
bread is lawful matter
for the eucharist, and that priests
must follow the rite of their own
church&mdash;those of the western, that of
the western; those of the eastern, that
of the eastern; fourthly, the question
of the different states of souls after
death was settled according to the
received doctrine which is now professed
in the Catholic Church. We
give the fifth section entire: "That
the holy apostolic see and the Roman
pontiff doth hold primacy over the
whole earth, and that he is the successor
of the blessed Peter, prince of
the apostles, and true vicar of Christ,
and head of the whole church, and
is the father and teacher of all Christians;
and that to him, in the person
of the blessed Peter, hath been delivered,
by our Lord Jesus Christ, the
full power of feeding, ruling, and governing
the universal church, as is
contained in the acts of &oelig;cumenical
councils and in the sacred canons."
Lastly, the decree reorganizing the
canonical order of patriarchs assigns
the second place, after the Roman
pontiff, to the patriarch of Constantinople,
the third to the patriarch of
Alexandria, the fourth to the patriarch
of Antioch. A few more questions
of minor importance were then proposed
to the Greeks, to most of which
they gave satisfactory replies, and soon
afterward the emperor and his prelates
returned home by way of Venice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_772" id="Page_772">[772]</a></span></p>

<p>The difficulty about <i>filioque</i> has
just been renewed by Mr. Ffoulkes,
of England, in defence of some notion
of his about a hybrid <em>united</em>, not
<em>one</em> church. We scarcely think he will
succeed in making good an objection
which Bessarion and Mark of Ephesus
failed to sustain. Any how, his
thesis appears to be, not that any one
"branch" of the church is entirely in
the right, but that they are all partly in
the wrong. Perhaps he thinks that to
him, not to F. Hyacinthe, has the Lord
given these sticks, to warm in his
bosom, purify, and finally reunite. We
must leave them to settle the question
between themselves. But they ought
to remember, with St. Jerome, that he
who gathereth not with the pope,
scattereth.</p>

<p>Great hopes were entertained that
the union perfected after such long
and free discussions would be lasting.
But these were all disappointed. Of
all the obscure questions connected
with the Greek schism, the most obscure
is how and when the compact
of Florence was first violated in the
east. It is certain that Metrophanes,
elected Patriarch of Constantinople
on the return of the Greek prelates,
(as the Patriarch Joseph had died at
Florence,) solemnly published the act
of union.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
His successor, Gregory,
was equally devoted to the council,
and before his elevation, defended its
action against the attacks of Mark of
Ephesus. This proud and turbulent
man did not remain quiet under his
defeat, but addressed most inflammatory
letters to the orientals, making
the vilest and most unfounded accusations,
not only against the pope and
the Latin bishops, but against his own
colleagues. Though these were refuted
by Gregory before mentioned,
and by Joseph, Bishop of Mothon,
they no doubt made a great impression
on the prejudiced, nay, jaundiced
oriental mind. Mark, however,
did not dare to publish his attacks
until after the death of John Palæologus,
(<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1448.)<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
A most extraordinary
and shameful political intrigue
appears to have come to the
aid of the schismatical party. The
Turk at this period was making his
arrangements for the final attack on
Constantinople. The only hope for
the doomed city was in aid from the
west. To prevent the sending of
this seasonable aid, it was the obvious
policy of the Mussulman to render
void the union of Florence. Hence,
in 1443, just ten years before the fall
of New Rome, a synod was held at
Jerusalem, composed entirely of bishops
of sees under Turkish domination,
among whom are numbered the
patriarchs of Alexandria, Antioch, and
Jerusalem, in which the act of union
was declared impious. Metrophanes
was adjudged to be an intruder into
the see of Constantinople, and all
ecclesiastics ordained by him were
deposed, full power being given to
the Metropolitan of Cæsarea to enforce
this sentence in all dioceses under
the jurisdiction of the council&mdash;that
is, wherever the crescent had supplanted
the cross.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>
Is it any wonder
that, ten years after, the Turks were
masters of the city of Constantine?</p>

<p>No one, not even a modern Greek,
would attempt to maintain that the
assemblage at Jerusalem was a legitimate
council. The schismatics, however,
allege a council said to have
been held at Constantinople a year
and a half after the Council of Florence,
and after the death of John
Palæologus, in which Metrophanes
was deposed and the union rescinded.
But there are two unfortunate anachronisms
in this account. Metrophanes
was certainly patriarch for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_773" id="Page_773">[773]</a></span>
three years after the council, and John
Palæologus did not die until 1448, nine
years after the act of union. One of
the last acts of the expiring Greek
empire was to send an ambassador
to Pope Nicholas V. promising the
exact and speedy fulfilment of the
agreement entered into at Florence.
We do not pretend to say that the
greater portion of the clergy and people
of Constantinople were not schismatics
at heart; but this we can aver,
that they were bound by the action
of their bishops, in the free, open
Council of Florence, and that this action
has never been formally retracted
by any legitimate council held
in the East. And we commend this
consideration to those Anglicans who
sometimes, in their desire for a false
union, seek to associate with Greek
schismatics. These are condemned
by the action of their fathers, an action
never formally retracted, but
merely opposed with a sullenness and
hardness of heart not unlike that with
which God visited Jerusalem before
its destruction. While the Greeks
were calling the Latins <i>Azymites</i>, and
other opprobrious names, the minister
of God's vengeance was approaching
their gates; New Rome fell into infidel
hands; and from the turret of St.
Sophia, whose dome had so often resounded
with excommunications of
the vicar of Christ, the <i>muezzin</i> now
invites the Moslem to prayer in the
name of the false prophet. Photius
and Cerularius aimed at making New
Rome the spiritual superior of the
city of Peter; instead, it has become
the chief city of the deadly enemy of
the Christian name.</p>

<p>This is a sad, sad story, and it is
not in exultation or triumph that we
pen these lines. While Mohammed II.
was advancing his last lines, Pope
Nicholas V. was making most strenuous
efforts to succor the "fair but
false" Greeks, and his successors never
gave up their efforts to regain the
city of Constantine until it was evident
that there was no possibility of
success.</p>

<p>The policy of Mohammed II. led
him to spare a remnant of the inhabitants
of the conquered city, and to
permit to them the free exercise of
their religion. But even in religious
matters, he claimed the prerogatives
of the sovereigns whom he had displaced.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the election and investiture of a
patriarch, the ceremonial of the Byzantine
court was revived and imitated. With a
mixture of satisfaction and horror, the Greeks
beheld the sultan on his throne; who delivered
into the hands of Gennadius (the patriarch
elect) the crosier or pastoral staff, the
symbol of his ecclesiastical office; who conducted
the patriarch to the gate of the seraglio,
presented him with a horse richly caparisoned,
and directed the viziers and bashaws
to lead him to the palace which had
been allotted for his residence."<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>And this degrading ceremony is continued
to this day, each "&oelig;cumenical
patriarch of New Rome" receiving
solemn investiture at the hands of the
Ottoman padisha.</p>

<p>The fall of Constantinople rendered
certain the success of the schismatical
party. The sultans detested the
name, as they feared the influence, of
the Roman pontiff; and it was plausibly
argued that to avow union with
him would be to insure their own destruction.
The Catholic element, thus
reduced to silence, gradually dwindled
away; and the schism, though
its abjuration at Florence remains in
full force, again blighted the Greek
Church.</p>

<p>As to hopes of reunion at the present
day, "it is not for us to know
the times or moments which the Father
hath put in his own power." We
can only hope and pray that light
may at length dispel the darkness
which has so long hung over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_774" id="Page_774">[774]</a></span>
Eastern Church. Ottoman policy no
longer requires the prolongation of
the schism; its only real supporter is
Russia. All the Greeks would have
to do would be to sign the act of
union of Florence. They can have
no difficulty about the Council of
Trent; for they have always condemned
the errors it condemns. Protestantism
has never found favor in
their eyes. If the Council of the Vatican
do not succeed in reuniting
them, it will, it is confidently expected,
at least renew the missionary spirit,
and inaugurate a work which, respecting
eastern susceptibilities, may
bring the church of Athanasius, Basil,
the Gregories, Chrysostom, and so
many other great saints and doctors
out of "darkness and the shadow of
death," and put an end to a schism
which commenced with the lawless
ambition of Photius, was renewed by
the satanic pride of Cerularius, and
has had for chief support the perfidious
policy, first of the degenerate
Christian emperors, then of the victorious
anti-Christian sultans of Constantinople.</p>

<h2>THE CHRIST OF AUSFELDT.</h2>


<p>We live in a sceptical age that
laughs at what it calls the superstitions
of the olden time; superstitions, if
you will, but often most beautiful,
particularly when viewed through the
mists of time and change. It is a relief
to come upon some living legend,
so to speak, while travelling over the
hard macadamized thoroughfare of our
practical lives, and I shall never forget
the pleasure I experienced in listening
to the recital of a story of the
olden time, told me by my gracious
hostess at the village inn where I had
been stopping for a few days while
making a pedestrian tour through the
southern part of Germany.</p>

<p>"<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ach, mein Herr!</i> and hast never
heard the legend of the Christ of
Ausfeldt?"</p>

<p>It stood, weather-beaten and worn,
just where the solid piers set their
mighty feet into the river; an old
stone crucifix that seemed to have
battled the storms of hundreds of
years.</p>

<p>While pausing in my morning walk
to gaze on it with a traveller's curiosity,
something in the general characteristics
of the figure attracted my
attention; and examining it more
closely, I immediately saw that it displayed
greater evidence of artistic
skill and execution than is generally
manifested in wayside images. Too
often they are but caricatures of that
semblance which is the most holy
and sacred of Christianity; but in the
face of the Christ that looked down
upon me from the stained and battered
cross, I read an expression of patient
suffering and God-like endurance
that would have borne noble testimony
to any sculptor.</p>

<p>Returning to the inn, a desire to
discover something of the history rather
of the sculptor than of the image
prompted me to make inquiry of my
good-natured landlady, who sat in
the twilight just outside of the house
door, knitting as only a German woman
can.</p>

<p>From that "<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ach, mein Herr!</i>" I
knew a story was coming; and knowing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_775" id="Page_775">[775]</a></span>
likewise, that Frau Gretchen was
a very princess in story-telling, I lighted
my pipe, and, stretching myself on
the wooden bench before the door,
prepared to be either saddened,
amused, or delighted, as the case
might be.</p>

<p>Frau Gretchen laid down her stocking
for a moment, smoothed the
whitest of white aprons, and having
looked toward the river, and then at
the ruined castle that surmounted
the hill beyond, resumed her knitting,
and, heaving a gentle sigh began:</p>

<p>"More than three hundred years
ago, and for hundreds of years before
that time, there dwelt in that old castle
yonder the noble lords of Ausfeldt.
They were great warriors; mighty in
stature and strength, and for generations
on generations had been feared
and hated by their vassals; for they
were wicked as they were violent, and
cruel as they were brave. Now, the
women were all fair and gentle; for
such was the power of the lords of
Ausfeldt that it was ever given them
to wed the flowers of the land; and it
seemed that the good God made for
them angel wives, so pure, and meek,
and pious, and charitable were the
ladies of Ausfeldt through centuries
and centuries of time.</p>

<p>"Now, it fell out that Berthold,
the reigning count, had been rescued
from drowning by Arnold, a wood-carver
of the town, whose skill in his
craft was well known and much sought
even from Alspach and Brauen. It
was on a Good-Friday, and the grateful
lord registered a vow to Heaven
that he would commemorate his preservation
by erecting an image of the
Saviour crucified nigh to the spot
where the waters had so nearly closed
over him for ever.</p>

<p>"For in those days, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">mein Herr</i>, although
the great and mighty were
fierce and cruel, faith was not dead in
their hearts, as it is in these evil times
of ours.</p>

<p>"Old Arnold of Ausfeldt, at his
own beseeching, was deputed to essay
his skill upon the Christ, and so well
did he execute the task that his fame
travelled far and wide. A large sum
of money was promised him; but
Berthold the master went off to the
wars, and forgot, as men often do,
his deliverer. Soon afterward old Arnold
died and left all alone in the
world his beautiful daughter, so fair
and spotless that she was called 'the
Lily of Ausfeldt.'</p>

<p>"As I said before, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">mein Herr</i>, the
dames of this haughty house were
gentle and good, and when poor Bertha
was left desolate, the Countess
Barbara sent for her to the castle, and
placed her among her own daughters
as a sort of companion and teacher;
for she had inherited from her mother
great dexterity in the use of the needle,
and from her father not a little
artistic skill.</p>

<p>"For a time all went well. But
alas! to every day, however bright,
there comes an ending; and thus the
morning of Bertha's happiness faded
and deepened into night.</p>

<p>"There arrived from a long journey
in the East the eldest son of the
house, the young Rupert; none
handsomer, none wittier, none more
courtly than he. Unlike his father
and most of his progenitors, he possessed
a winning tongue and beguiling
air; he had loitered in ladies' bowers,
and they had taught him well.</p>

<p>"Into the pure blue eyes of the Lily
of Ausfeldt he looked as would the
serpent into the eyes of a trembling
dove. But the blue depths, though
they quivered, grew no darker nor
deeper; there was no guile in the
heart, and it knew not the presence
of sin. Close to the innocent cheek
of the maiden the tempter breathed
his poisonous breath; but the guardian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_776" id="Page_776">[776]</a></span>
angel of purity folded his wings about
her, and wafted a fold of his misty
veil between that hot breath and her
unsoiled innocence, until, man of the
world though he was, Count Rupert
shrank into himself abashed, and loved
for the first time in his reckless life
with a pure, deep, passionate love.</p>

<p>"Day after day he sought her side,
night after night they wandered together
by the river; her soul all full
of faith, and hope, and beauty; his
racked by fears of his father's anger;
for in his heart of hearts he knew that
his father would sooner slay him with
his own hand than bend the lofty
pride of Ausfeldt to a union with a
simple burgher maiden.</p>

<p>"<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ach, ach, Herr Karl!</i> love is a
pleasant thing, and a delicious thing,
and a holy thing; for it is heaven-born:
but woman's faith is still more
beautiful and heavenly; and man's
fickleness and perfidy the story of
every day. It has been the same
all the world over since time began,
and so it will be to the end.</p>

<p>"They parted at last&mdash;war called
him away; but he left her with a vow
upon his lips that was broken ere the
birds sang the advent of another summer.
There came rumors of a marriage
with a great heiress of the north;
but Bertha knew no fears, for her own
heart was pure and true, and she did
not dream that his could be faithless.
Alas! there are many like her in the
world, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">mein Herr</i>, even in our day,
when most people are forgetting what
love means.</p>

<p>"Soon the castle was astir with unusual
bustle and preparation, and then
there was no secret made of the fact
that the young Lord Rupert would
soon bring home a bride. Whether
he was weak or wicked, who can tell?
God has judged and meted him his
portion long ere this; but in her heart
poor Bertha never blamed him. Yet
she grew pale and thin; but no one
noticed it; and that she spent long
nights of weary weeping none knew
save her guardian angel.</p>

<p>"It was a still, starry midnight. All
alone in her little chamber, Bertha
leaned forth from the casement; but
she did not weep. Suddenly, as by
an irresistible impulse, she hurried from
the room, down the winding stairs,
through the long garden, down, down
the steep hill, till she stood on the
brink of the river.</p>

<p>"Beneath her its waters flowed dark
and rippling, and they were cold, oh!
so cold, and her head burned and
throbbed so wildly.</p>

<p>"One plunge, and her woes would
be over for ever&mdash;thus whispered the
fiend beside her&mdash;one step, and the
cool waves would receive her! 'What
is life to thee now?' said a mocking
voice in her ear. 'What eternity of
woe canst thou suffer more terrible
than this? There is no eternity,
naught but oblivion. Nearer and
nearer thy faithless lover hastens with
his beautiful bride; how canst thou
bear day after day to meet him, to
dwell under the same roof with thy
rival. Have courage, plunge boldly!
the waves, more merciful than the
world, will receive thee, and to-morrow
thou wilt float on their broad bosom,
far away to the sea.'</p>

<p>"As the maiden lifted her hands
from her eyes, as though to take a last
look on the world ere she left it, something
white gleamed in the moonlight;
it was the stone crucifix at
whose feet she had so often knelt in
days of happiness and innocence, the
cross her father had fashioned with
hands and heart consecrated to heaven.</p>

<p>"Trembling in every limb, she dragged
her weary feet to the spot; and
as she threw herself upon her knees
before the image, bitter sobs burst
from her bosom.</p>

<p>"The sad face of the <i>dead Christ</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_777" id="Page_777">[777]</a></span>
looked down upon her with eyes of
divine compassion, and brought to
her memory and to her heart a vision
of the dear departed who had wrought
this labor of love, and of that father's
affection, and of his pure and holy
teachings, which she had so nearly forgotten
for evermore.</p>

<p>"With a wild cry she clasped the
nail-pierced feet, and her whole soul
poured itself forth in one deep, wailing
supplication.</p>

<p>"'My God, my God!' she moaned,
'why hast thou forsaken me? Take
me out of this weary world, as I lie
here penitent and fearful, lest the evil
one come again to tempt me, and I
yield in my weakness and brokenness
of heart. The river is black and pitiless,
my Saviour; but not so black
and pitiless as the world. Save me,
oh! save me from myself. How shall
I know that thou hast not deserted
me? How shall I hope that thou
wilt pardon, that thou wilt hear my
prayer?'</p>

<p>"The moon, which had shrunk behind
a cloud, came softly forth and
bathed the image and the shrinking
figure at its feet in holy light; while,
as the maiden knelt, there passed into
her stricken heart a quiet, hopeful
feeling, and, looking up half timidly,
she pushed back her loosened hair
to meet once more the sad, pitying
glance above her.</p>

<p>"And then she clasped her trembling
hands together, and bent her weary
head low down to the very earth; for
around the brow of the <i>dead Christ</i>
there shone a heavenly halo, blood
trickled from the thorny crown and
reddened the outstretched hands, and
from the soft, compassionate eyes great
tears were falling.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Twenty years afterward, the holy
Abbess of Ausfeldt lay upon her
death-bed; and the good sisters gathered
around her, and even the choristers
and little serving-boys; for they
all loved her well: and there came
into her eyes a light, and to her voice
a strength, neither had known for
many a day; and just as I tell it to
you, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">mein Herr</i>, she told them the
story of the <i>Christ of Ausfeldt</i>. For
her name had been Bertha, and it
was her own story.</p>

<p>"And she begged that no Christian
might ever pass the sacred spot without
breathing a prayer for her soul.
Ah! <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">mein Herr</i>, many a time have I
passed the holy image and almost
fancied it smiled upon me as I went."</p>

<p>Silently Frau Gretchen folded up her
knitting, and with a sigh toward the
river, and another toward the ruined
castle, stepped slowly down the garden
path, humming dreamily as she
walked Schiller's song of "The Mill":</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The mill-wheel ceaseless turneth,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Beside the mill I know;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she who once did dwell there<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hath vanished long ago."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Catching her thought, I murmured
the plaintive words as I passed out
of the gateway and down the old,
shadowy street. They had "vanished
long ago"&mdash;the great inheritors and
the noble line, the faithless lover
and the pure "Lily of Ausfeldt." But
the bright, silvery moonlight made
clear and distinct the sculptured image
I had come to seek. The legend
had invested it with an almost living
interest, and as I paused before it,
with as reverential a feeling as I have
ever known in the contemplation of
earth's grandest Raphaels or Murillos,
I said half aloud, as I lingered
for a moment near the quiet river,
"O beautiful old German legends!
may you live in your purity and holiness
in the hearts of the German
people as long as the Rhine flows
through the pleasant courses and by
the fruitful vineyards its wandering
spirit loves."</p>

<h2>MRS. SETON.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></h2>


<p>Elizabeth Ann Bayley, the foundress
of the Sisterhood of Charity in
the United States, was born in the
city of New York, on the 28th of
August, 1774. Her father, Dr. Richard
Bayley, was a physician of good
family and distinguished position, a
member of the Church of England,
and a man of many natural virtues;
but he cared very little about religion,
and wherever his daughter may have
got the pious inclinations which distinguished
her in girlhood, she certainly
did not get them from him.
Her mother, whose maiden name was
Charlton, died while Elizabeth was a
child. Under the care of her father,
however, Miss Bayley was well educated
and trained in domestic duties.
At the age of nineteen she married
Mr. William Magee Seton, eldest son
of a prosperous New York merchant,
and descendant of an ancient Scottish
patrician family, whose head is the
Earl of Winton. Their married life
was eminently happy, and for six or
seven years fortune smiled upon them.
Commercial disasters at last swept
away their property. Dr. Bayley died
suddenly of a malignant fever contracted
in the discharge of his duty
as health officer of the port; Mr. Seton's
health failed, and in 1803 the
husband and wife determined to make
a voyage to Italy. They suffered a
long and painful quarantine at Leghorn,
and a week after their release
Mr. Seton died, leaving his wife in a
strange land with her eldest child,
a girl of nine years. Mrs. Seton
was not, however, without comfort
and protection. Two estimable Italian
gentlemen, Philip and Anthony
Filicchi, personal friends and business
correspondents of the Setons, took
her to their home and treated her
with most brotherly kindness. Under
the influence of the devout household
of which they were the heads, the religious
sentiments of the young widow
were gradually developed into a strong
attraction toward the Catholic Church.
She went with the Filicchis to mass;
she visited the chapels; she learned
devotion to the Blessed Virgin. Early
in February, 1804, about six weeks
after Mr. Seton's death, she sailed for
home. But it was not the purpose
of Providence that she should be
withdrawn so soon from associations
which were to influence remarkably
her future life. In a severe storm the
vessel in which she had taken passage
was so much injured as to be
driven back to port. Before another
was ready to sail, Mrs. Seton's child
was taken sick. Close upon the recovery
of the child, followed the sickness
of the mother; and when, in
April, they were ready again to embark,
one of the Filicchi brothers,
Anthony, offered to bear them company.
During the long voyage of
nearly two months, Mrs. Seton made
frequent opportunities to talk with her
friend upon religion, and before the
vessel reached New York she was virtually
a convert. The last step cost
her much suffering and perplexity. It is
a step which hardly ever is taken without
pain. In her case there was not
only the dread of estrangement from affectionate
relatives, but she could not
face with composure the inevitable
rupture with a clergyman of the Protestant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_779" id="Page_779">[779]</a></span>
Episcopal Church who had exercised
a great deal of influence upon
her character and her earlier life. This
was the amiable John Henry Hobart,
afterward Bishop of New York, a
man who was deeply and deservedly
beloved, and for whom Mrs. Seton in
particular cherished a filial regard.
By Mr. Filicchi's advice, she exposed
her difficulties to Mr. Hobart. He
made an elaborate reply to them. He
talked with her frequently. He used
all his talent, all his scholarship, all
his personal influence to keep her in
the denomination in which she had
been born. Between Mr. Hobart and
her family, on the one hand, and the
letters of Philip Filicchi and personal
interviews with Anthony, on the
other, her perplexity became painful
to the last degree. At last, on Ash-Wednesday,
1805, she was received
into the church by Father O'Brien,
at St. Peter's, in Barclay street. Her
soul was now at peace, but her temporal
troubles had only begun. Old
friends and nearest relatives turned
away horrified and angry, and when
soon afterward her sister-in-law Cecilia
was likewise baptized a Catholic,
the indignation of the family knew
no bounds. She was without fortune,
and when she tried to earn a support
by teaching, she found the good Protestants
of New York afraid to intrust
the education of their children
to an emissary of the pope, perhaps
a female Jesuit in disguise. The kindness
of her excellent Italian friends
again came to her relief. They charged
themselves with the education of
her children, placed the two sons at
Georgetown College, gave her an allowance
of $400 a year, and begged
Mrs. Seton to draw upon them for
whatever money she wanted. We
believe she was not obliged, however,
to avail herself of this generous offer.</p>

<p>Mrs. Seton seems to have formed,
at an early period of her widowhood,
the project of devoting herself to God
in the service of a religious order,
and her first plan was to go to Canada
and join some sisterhood there. It
was a part of this scheme, however,
that her children should enter a house
of education at Montreal, where she
could still give them the maternal
care which their tender years required.
Providential obstacles defeated
this design, and thus she was reserved
for the establishment in her own
country of the noble institute with
which her name will always be connected.
We shall quote from Dr.
White's <i>Life</i> the story of how she began
the great work of her career:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Her thoughts were more practically directed
to it by the Rev. William Valentine
Dubourg, president of St. Mary's College
in Baltimore. He became acquainted with
her in the following way: Having visited
the city of New York in the autumn of
1806, he was one morning offering up the
holy sacrifice of mass in St. Peter's Church,
when a lady presented herself at the communion-rail,
and, bathed in tears, received
the Blessed Sacrament at his hands. He
was struck with the uncommon deportment
and piety of the communicant, and when
afterward seated at the breakfast-table with
the Rev. Mr. Sibourd, one of the pastors
of the church, he inquired who she was,
rightly judging in his mind that it was Mrs.
Seton, of whose conversion and edifying life
he had been informed. Before Mr. Sibourd
had time to answer his question, a gentle
tap at the door was heard, and the next moment
Mrs. Seton was introduced, and knelt
before the priest of God to receive his blessing.
Entering into conversation with her
respecting her sons and her intentions in
their regard, he learned from her the views
and wishes of Mr. Filicchi, as stated above,
and the remote expectation she had of removing
herself, with her daughters, to Canada.
Mr. Dubourg, who was a man of
enlarged views and remarkable enterprise,
no sooner became acquainted with the design
which she entertained of retiring at
some future period into a religious community,
for the welfare of herself and her children,
than he suggested the practicability
of the scheme within the limits of the United
States. Mrs. Seton immediately wrote
to Bishop Carroll, informing him of what
had passed between her and Mr. Dubourg,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_780" id="Page_780">[780]</a></span>
and requesting his advice in the matter. 'I
could not venture,' she says, 'to take a further
step in so interesting a situation without
your concurrence and direction, which
also, I am assured, will the more readily
obtain for me the blessing of Him whose will
alone it is my earnest desire to accomplish.' After
mentioning the particular trials she had to
contend with in New York, and assuring Dr.
Carroll that she had yielded in condescension
to her opponents every point possible consistently
with her peace for the hour of death,
she continues, 'And for that hour, my dear
sir, I now beg you to consider, while you
direct me how to act for my dear little children,
who in that hour, if they remain in
their present situation, would be snatched
from our dear faith as from an accumulation
of error as well as misfortune to them. For
myself, certainly the only fear I can have is
that there is too much of self-seeking in
pleading for the accomplishment of this object,
which, however, I joyfully yield to the
will of the Almighty, confident that, as he
has disposed my heart to wish above all
things to please him, it will not be disappointed
in the desire, whatever may be his
appointed means. The embracing a religious
life has been, from the time I was in
Leghorn, so much my hope and consolation,
that I would at any moment have embraced
all the difficulties of again crossing the ocean
to attain it, little imagining it could be accomplished
here. But now my children are
so circumstanced that I could not die in
peace (and you know, dear sir, we must
make every preparation) except I felt the
full conviction I had done all in my power
to shield them from it; in that case, it would
be easy to commit them to God.'</p>

<p>"While Mrs. Seton was consulting Bishop
Carroll in regard to the important arrangement
suggested by Mr. Dubourg, this
gentleman was conferring with the Rev.
Messrs. Matignon and Cheverus, of Boston,
upon the same subject. After having weighed
the matter attentively, they came to the
conclusion that her Canada scheme should
be abandoned, and that it would be preferable
to exert her talents in the way proposed
by Mr. Dubourg. Mr. Cheverus wrote to
her, 'hoping that this project would do better
for her family, and being sure it would
be very conducive to the progress of religion
in this country.' It was the opinion,
however, of these distinguished clergymen
that the execution of the design should not be
precipitate; and they therefore advised her,
through Mr. Dubourg, 'to wait the manifestation
of the divine will&mdash;the will of a
Father most tender, who will not let go the
child afraid to step alone.' The wise forethought
of Dr. Matignon led him to believe
that Mrs. Seton was called, in the designs
of God's providence, to be the instrument
of some special mercies that he wished to
dispense to the church in this country. 'I
have only to pray to God,' he wrote to her,
'to bless your views and his, and to give
you the grace to fulfil them for his greater
glory. <i>You are destined, I think, for some
great good in the United States</i>, and here you
should remain in preference to any other location.
For the rest, God has his moments,
which we must not seek to anticipate, and a
prudent delay only brings to maturity the
good desires which he awakens within us.'
Bishop Carroll, in answer to Mrs. Seton's
inquiries, informed her that, although he
was entirely ignorant of all particulars, yet,
to approve the plan of Mr. Dubourg, it was
enough for him to know that it had the concurrence
of Dr. Matignon and Mr. Cheverus."</p></blockquote>

<p>She did wait patiently nearly two
years. At the end of that time her
pecuniary affairs became so embarrassing,
and the inconveniences of her
situation in New York pressed upon
her so severely, that she was again
driven to turn her thoughts toward
Canada, not so much as a refuge from
her own troubles, but as an asylum
where her children might be saved
from the dangers which threatened
their faith in the Protestant society of
New York. But about this time she
met Mr. Dubourg again, and, in answer
to his inquiries, gave him an exact
account of her situation. He contemplated
the establishment of a Catholic
school for girls in Baltimore, and
invited her to come and take charge
of it. Her two boys he offered to admit
into St. Mary's College, free of expense.
The school was to be started
in a small way, in a two-story hired
house; and afterward, if God prospered
the undertaking, a proper building
for the institution was to be erected
on ground belonging to the college.
Of course, Mrs. Seton accepted
the proposition with joy. On the 9th
of June, 1808, she embarked for Baltimore
in a packet, accompanied by
her three daughters. It was a voyage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_781" id="Page_781">[781]</a></span>
in those times, of between six and seven
days. She landed on the morning
of the 16th, the feast of Corpus
Christi, and drove at once from the
wharf to St. Mary's chapel to hear
mass.</p>

<p>It is almost impossible to describe
the happiness which beams from her
letters written in her new home to
her friends in Italy, her favorite sisters-in-law,
Cecilia and Harriet Seton,
(the latter of whom was, at this time,
strongly attracted toward the church,
while the other, as we have already
mentioned, was a fervent convert,)
and her spiritual advisers. United with
her children, in a comfortable little
home close to the seminary and college,
where she found in the chapel
services an unfailing source of delight,
she had all that her domestic affections
and pious desires could wish.
The relatives of Mr. Dubourg and
other Catholics of the city treated her
with great cordiality, and from many
distinguished Protestant families she
received marked social attentions.
The school was opened in September.
Mrs. Seton had not thought, so far,
of adopting any thing like a conventual
rule of life, except perhaps at
some remote period; but her daily
life was regulated with reference to
the consecration of all her powers to
God, and she mingled no further in
society than a regard for good breeding
and gratitude to her friends absolutely
required. The development of
her religious schemes was gradual,
and the foundation of the new sisterhood
appears, from a human point of
view, the result of accident and curious
coincidence, rather than the fruit
of direct labor. The first step toward
it was the arrival at Mrs. Seton's Baltimore
establishment of a young lady
from Philadelphia, named Cecilia
O'Conway. The Rev. Mr. Babade,
the spiritual director of the school,
found this young lady on the point
of going to Europe to enter a convent.
He told her of Mrs. Seton's
plans, and she determined to go to
Baltimore instead. In December,
1808, Miss O'Conway accordingly
became an assistant in the school.</p>

<p>Mr. Filicchi had made an offering
of one thousand dollars toward the
realization of Mrs. Seton's plans; but
now came, in a most unexpected
manner, a new benefactor, whose liberality
gave the enterprise a different
character and vastly enlarged scope.
Among the students of theology at
St. Mary's Seminary, was Mr. Samuel
Cooper, a gentleman of fortune, a
Virginian, and formerly well known
in fashionable society. His conversion
from Protestantism and determination
to study for the priesthood had
caused quite as great a sensation as
the conversion of Mrs. Seton. He
now purposed distributing his property
among the poor, (before his death,
we may here add, that he literally gave
away all he possessed,) and one morning
he spoke to Mr. Dubourg about
doing something for the instruction
of poor children. He had never
spoken upon the subject with Mrs.
Seton, but he suggested at this interview
that possibly she might undertake
the work, if he gave the money.
It is a very remarkable fact that at
this same moment Mrs. Seton was
thinking of the same thing. That
morning after communion she felt a
strong desire arise within her to dedicate
herself to the care and instruction
of poor girls. She went at once
to Mr. Dubourg. "This morning,"
she said, "in my communion, I
thought, 'Dearest Saviour, if you
would but give me the care of poor
little children, no matter how poor!'
and Mr. Cooper being directly before
me at his thanksgiving, I thought,
'He has money: if he would but give
it for the bringing up of poor little children
to know and love you!'" The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_782" id="Page_782">[782]</a></span>
result of this extraordinary, or we
ought rather to say, providential coincidence,
was, that Mr. Cooper gave
eight thousand dollars for the establishment
of the proposed institution, and
fixed upon Emmettsburg as the place;
and there a farm with a very small
stone house upon it was bought, in
the names of the Rev. William V. Dubourg,
Mr. Samuel Cooper, and the
Rev. John Dubois, who was then
pastor of several congregations in
that part of Maryland, and director
at the same time of the small school
near Emmettsburg, out of which soon
afterward grew Mount St. Mary's College.
With the college and its illustrious
founder the fortunes of Mrs. Seton's
institute became intimately connected.</p>

<p>While these arrangements were in
progress, the new community was gradually
and quietly forming at the little
house in Baltimore. A second
associate, Miss Maria Murphy, of
Philadelphia, joined Mrs. Seton in
April, 1809. In May, two more presented
themselves, Miss Mary Ann
Butler, of Philadelphia, and Miss Susan
Clossy, of New York. It was not
without a painful sense of unfitness
that, in obedience to the directions
of her bishop and spiritual advisers,
Mrs. Seton undertook the government
of this religious household. On
the evening of the day when the task
was definitely laid upon her "she
was seized," says Dr. White,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"with a transport of mingled love and humility
in reflecting upon the subject. Being
with two or three of her sisters, and the discourse
turning upon the probable designs
of providence in their regard, Mother Seton
became so penetrated with the awful responsibility,
and sense of her own incapacity,
that she was almost inconsolable. For
some moments she wept bitterly in silence;
then, throwing herself upon her knees, she
confessed aloud the most frail and humiliating
actions of her life from her childhood
upward; after which she exclaimed in the
most affecting manner, her hands and eyes
raised toward heaven and the tears gushing
down her cheeks, 'My gracious God! You
know my unfitness for this task. I who by
my sins have so often crucified you, I blush
with shame and confusion! How can I
teach others who know so little myself, and
am so miserable and imperfect?' The sisters
who were present were overwhelmed by
the scene before them, and, falling on their
knees, gave vent to their tears and painful
emotions."</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 1st of June they assumed a
religious habit, and the next day&mdash;Corpus
Christi&mdash;appeared in it for the
first time at church. It was not a
regular nun's garb, but an imitation
of the dress which Mrs. Seton had
worn ever since the death of her husband.
It consisted of a black gown
with a short cape, similar to a costume
she had seen in some Italian sisterhood,
a white muslin cap with a
crimped border, and a black band
around the head, fastened under the
chin. A regular order of daily life
was established, and Mrs. Seton privately,
in the presence of Bishop
Carroll, took the ordinary vows of
poverty, chastity, and obedience for
the period of one year. Her associates,
however, did not as yet make
any vows, nor was any special religious
institute adopted for their organization.
They merely styled themselves
"Sisters of St. Joseph." Mr.
Dubourg was appointed their ecclesiastical
superior.</p>

<p>About this time Miss Cecilia Seton
fell dangerously ill, and was advised
by her physicians to make a visit to
Baltimore. Harriet accompanied her,
and with these two beloved relatives,
one of her daughters, and one member
of the sisterhood, Mrs. Seton removed
to Emmettsburg on the 21st
of June, finding shelter at first in a
little log hut on the mountain, as their
own house on the farm was not yet
ready for use. Her happy union
with Cecilia and Harriet was for a
few months only. Harriet became a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_783" id="Page_783">[783]</a></span>
Catholic; but in the first fervor of her
devotion was seized with a fever, and
died on the 22d of December. Cecilia
grew better for a short time, and
even joined the community; but she
failed gradually, and died in Baltimore
in April. During the first autumn
and winter at Emmettsburg the
institution was little better than a
hospital. The farm-house, into which
the whole community, then numbering
ten, moved in the course of the
summer, consisted of nothing but two
rooms on the ground floor and two in
the attic, and these had to afford accommodations
not only for the ten
sisters, but for Mrs. Seton's three
daughters, her sister-in-law Harriet,
and two pupils who followed her from
Baltimore. Added to the discomfort
of their narrow quarters was a state
of poverty so extreme that they sometimes
knew not where to look for
their next meal. For coffee they
substituted a beverage made of carrots
and sweetened with molasses.
Their bread was of rye and of the
coarsest description. At Christmas
they thought themselves fortunate in
having for dinner smoked herrings
and a spoonful of molasses apiece.
In the course of the winter, however,
a two-story log house of convenient
size was put up for their use, and now
they were able to open a day-school
and take more boarding-pupils, and
so provide at least for their daily expenses.
The debt incurred in making
these improvements was, nevertheless,
a severe burden for them, and at one
time it seemed inevitable that they
should sell out and disperse; but charitable
friends came to their relief at
the last moment, and, little by little,
with many fluctuations of fortune,
they got out of their difficulties.</p>

<p>When they determined, about the
time of coming to Emmettsburg, to
adopt the rule of St. Vincent of Paul,
they sent to France and begged some
of the sisters of the society to come
over and place themselves at the head
of the new American community.
The invitation was accepted; but the
French government would not allow
the sisters to sail, so the most that
Mrs. Seton could get was a copy of
the rules and a kind letter of encouragement.
These rules, modified to
meet the peculiar wants of the new
institution, by permitting it to receive
pay-scholars in connection with its
labors of charity, and with special
provisions to allow Mrs. Seton to devote
the necessary care to her young
children, were approved by Bishop
Carroll as the rule for the "Sisters of
Charity of St. Joseph," and so the
community which has done such a
noble work in the United States came
into existence with Mrs. Seton for its
first mother superior.</p>

<p>We have no intention of sketching
in this brief paper the rise and development
of that sisterhood. The log
house in "St. Joseph's Valley," at the
foot of Mount St. Mary, has a renown
in the history of the American church
upon which many able pens have enlarged,
and branch communities have
gone out from it, filling remote parts
of the United States with good works
and pious example. Our purpose has
been merely to sketch the foundation
of the illustrious community, and tell
our readers something of the trials
and sorrows under which Mrs. Seton
achieved her great work. The rest
of her life, though it was blessed with
the consolation of success in her undertaking,
was torn with afflictions not
less severe than those she had suffered
already. Her eldest and her
youngest daughters were both taken
from her as they were just entering
upon a beautiful womanhood, the eldest,
Anna, being already a member of
the community. The deaths among
her earliest associates were many, and
she had also to mourn the loss of one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_784" id="Page_784">[784]</a></span>
of the excellent Italian friends who
contributed so much to the success
of her enterprise. But in all her sorrows
she preserved the calmness of
divine resignation, the charm of her
personal presence, and the kind, unselfish
interest in others which made
her so generally beloved. She died
on the 4th of January, 1821; and on
the wall of the humble chamber where
she expired, the following memento is
now shown:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Here, near this door, by this fireplace,
on a poor, lowly couch, died our cherished
and saintly Mother Seton, on the 4th of
January, 1821. She died in poverty, but
rich in faith and good works. May we, her
children, walk in her footsteps and share
one day in her happiness! Amen!"</p></blockquote>

<p>The two works whose titles we
have placed at the head of this article
are very much alike in the general
character of their contents, having
both been prepared from the same
materials. Dr. White's <i>Life</i> has been
many years before the public, and
has been much commended for its
devotional spirit and appreciative
judgment of Mrs. Seton's labors.
The larger work, just issued in two
handsome volumes, and printed and
bound with considerable elegance,
has been prepared by Mrs. Seton's
grandson. It has apparently been for
the editor a labor of love. He has
drawn freely from the family records
which Dr. White used before him,
and has quoted much more of Mrs.
Seton's letters than his predecessor
did, so that the work is almost equivalent
to an autobiography of the
foundress of St. Joseph's, illustrated
with abundant explanatory notes, and
with only so much narrative as seemed
necessary to bind the whole together.
It is not only an interesting
memorial of a very interesting woman,
but an important contribution
to the materials which we hope the
coming historian will some day reduce
into a comprehensive history of
the American church.</p>

<h2>VIEWS OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT.</h2>


<p>If we consider the existing industrial
nations with the eye of political
economy or of political philosophy,
we cannot help giving attention to
the deep and wide-spread disagreements
which have broken open between
the laboring man and his
employers. In France, Switzerland,
Germany, England, and the United
States, the question of the relative
rights of labor and capital are presented
in many ways, so as to compel
investigation and action. Trades-unions,
coöperative societies, industrial
congresses, and lastly, that herculean
infant, the Labor Reform Party, are
extending themselves all over the
countries we have just named, and
particularly over the United States.
They are daily gaining strength and
influence. Politicians are thinking
how to obtain the favor of this party,
at the least cost to their popularity
among other partisans. The larger
parties already offer to compromise
with it, and to give it a plank in their
great platforms. It is evident that, if
the working-men were to move with
unanimity to form a labor party, it
would be a most formidable rival to
the others.</p>

<p>The mere fact of the advent of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_785" id="Page_785">[785]</a></span>
new party is not at all startling to an
American; for since the independence
of this country, several parties have
come into existence, and have been
swept away by the advent or success
of others; but the working-men's party
proposes to carry into our legislation
and into the administration of the
government tendencies and principles
so diametrically opposite to and
destructive of any precedent course or
system of politics, that the prospect
of these tendencies being powerfully
reënforced excites vehement emotions
of anxiety or satisfaction, according to
the previous bias of the observer.
Just think of it: the question is no
longer to be only what ought to be
the policy of the nation, regarded as
an unit, toward other nations or toward
itself, nor what are the interests
and rights of <i>territorial</i> integers; but
what ought to be the action of one
great <i>component element</i> upon the
other essential elements of the body
politic. The people are called upon
to consider not only the questions
relative to tariffs, taxation, banks,
currency, national debt, bonds, State
rights, or the like; but to answer the
complaint of the bone and sinew of
the country against its veins and blood.
The brain claims the right to decide;
and it appears there is a possibility of
there being a preponderance of brain
on the side of the complainants. The
spread of education produces astonishing
consequences; and among the
rest this: science is becoming so common
that the great cannot monopolize
it all, and much of it is going to
take service among the poor. Hence,
able and eloquent speakers and writers
are now contending that labor does
not receive its full and merited reward,
and that the laborer is oppressed
by his employers and the laws. Hence,
too, a great number and variety of
novel measures and institutions are
ingeniously contrived and plausibly
advocated for the avowed purpose of
overthrowing some of the most venerated
doctrines of orthodox political
economy.</p>

<p>As in other cases, this movement
develops every grade of opinion and
feeling. A rich philanthropist thinks
more education and better lodging-houses,
at less cost, will be a good
and sufficient remedy; while among
the poor the most violent measures
are sometimes preferred. Even agrarianism
is proposed, and incendiarism
attempted, in order to redress whatever
wrongs the toiler really suffers, or imagines
he suffers, unjustly. Between
the two, we have mild and harmless
contrivances, such as mutual aid societies,
and coöperative shops and
stores, intended to diminish the causes
of pauperism or alleviate its bad effects.</p>

<p>All the plans, of course, differ, according
to the idea the proposers have
formed of the nature of the causes of
the social malady. Some regard the
miseries of the laboring classes as the
accumulated effects of many mere accidents,
principally personal imprudence
and vice; and, since they think
there is no radical cause, refuse to
hear of a radical remedy. Others
admit radical causes, such as (1) a bad
form of government, or (2) the selfish,
the uncharitable, the unchristian spirit
of the world, or (3) the too rapid increase
and local crowding of population,
or (4) the progressive individualization
of capital, or (5) popular ignorance,
or (6) the onerous obligations
of marriage and parentage, or (7)
what they call the slavery of woman,
or (8) the present land-ownership
system, or some other prevalent
mode of acquiring property, such as
(9) usury, (10) monopoly, (11) rents,
(12) heirships, (13) tariffs, (14) banking,
(15) speculation, and the like.
Above all these looms the fact, whatever
may be the cause, that capital is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_786" id="Page_786">[786]</a></span>
becoming less and less in the hands of
those who produce it, and is growing
larger and larger in the hands of cunning
or lucky exploiters.</p>

<p>The variety of opinions with regard
to what the remedy should be has
produced correspondingly various institutions,
parties, and laws. So we
have (1) poor laws, vagrant laws,
work-houses and reformatory prisons,
for juvenile delinquents and others;
(2) charity hospitals, asylums for the
widows, the orphans, the deaf and
dumb, the blind, the crippled, the
aged, the infirm, or the insane; warming-houses,
lying-in hospitals, poor
mothers' cradle-houses, gratuitous
sleeping-halls, soup-houses, asylums
for unruly or destitute children of both
sexes, gratuitous dispensaries of medicines,
Magdalen reformatory houses,
Sisters of Charity, Brothers of Mercy,
Little Sisters of the Poor, Christian
Brothers' schools, public schools, etc.;
(3) visiting confraternities to bring succor
home to the poor, such as fuel-giving,
furnishing provisions or nursing,
and prison-visiting societies; (4)
organizations to support charitable institutions
by means of fairs, lotteries,
concerts, spectacles, picnics, tournaments,
and other amusements; (5)
labor-protective unions, workmen's
guilds and fellowships, trades-unions
and labor combinations, savings
banks, coöperative factories, coöperative
stores, mutual aid societies, burial
societies, labor reform party; (6)
Shaker, Rappist, Moravian, and Ballouite
communities; (7) Owenite <i>Harmonias</i>,
Cabetite <i>Familisteries</i>, Fourierite
<i>Phalansterias</i>, women's rights societies,
Mormon harems, and artistic
brothels of complex association.</p>

<p>Every one who reads this list will
find in it the mention of some institution
he believes to be either useless or
pernicious. The objections would be
curiously heterogeneous. An infidel
would suppress all those having their
root or support in religion. A political
economist will protest against
working-men's combinations to raise
the price of labor. A Christian deplores
the attempts of socialists to establish
institutions from which God
is excluded. A sectarian sees with
pain the success of charities founded
by other congregations. The Roman
Catholic (as such) must also have his
opinions of the relative merits of the
corporations that appear to him to rise
sometimes out of the sea of sin, and
sometimes out of the waters of life. We,
for ourselves, have some peculiar ideas,
gathered from this point of view.</p>

<p>It would be vain obduracy on the
part of a Catholic to close his eyes to
the deep and wide-spread clamor of
the voices, great and small, that are
now discussing "social science," and
proposing solutions of the "labor
question." These matters, in every
imaginable manner, are obtruding
themselves upon the attention of the
manufacturer, politician, and legislator;
and must soon command that of
the farmer and merchant; and by
and by, even the solicitude of the
church. Indeed, we should not say
"by and by;" for already, while the
world is agitated by the strikes and
the labor congresses, while the parliament
of Great Britain, through its
committees, is carrying on the minutest
investigations of the eight-hour
and higher wages movements, our
holy father at Rome has pronounced
public allocutions against <i>socialism</i>.</p>

<p>Very certainly society, the state, and
the church will soon deeply feel the effects
of the agitation of mind and feeling
going on among the working people.
The allocution of his holiness shows
that this consequence has not escaped
his penetrating intellect. He sees clearly
that the agitation will be injurious
or produce beneficial results according
to the principles, Christian or anti-christian,
that shall prevail within it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_787" id="Page_787">[787]</a></span>
To avoid or prevent the fermentation
and its products is impossible. It
must take place; and the question is,
how to make it yield clear and palatable
wine. To think that the church
can ignore it, and go on as if nothing
were shaking the body politic, and disturbing
the souls of the people, would
be to stultify ourselves. The issue
raised is too important, and the tendency
to revolution too powerfully
pressed to be disregarded and treated
with contempt. See the great number
of societies the workmen have
formed in every Northern State. These
societies have already drawn a majority
of the skilled operatives, and there
is a prospect of their finally absorbing
all the working-people. The agricultural
laborers already give signs of
sympathy with the movement.</p>

<p>Of course, we understand that it
matters not to the church what economic
or political party governs the state.
The controversies between Democrat
and Republican, free-trade and protection,
labor and capital, are mere
worldly matters, and do not concern
the church; but the coming issue has
a deeper cause than a mere question
of temporal expediency. In the
midst of the unanimous demand for
a change the men of labor are making,
we can also perceive, not only
that the wished-for changes are fundamental
and revolutionary, but also
that the leaders are actuated by very
different principles, and aim at different
ultimates, and that these relate
to the very origin, basis, and end
of private and public morality and
religion. Some move by the light of
Christianity, some by that of natural
reason as exhibited by the modern infidel
schools of philosophy&mdash;naturalism,
rationalism, individualism, positivism,
and evolutionism. Very different
motives and very different hopes move
the principal agitators, though they
now act with great unanimity. The
working multitude, who complain of
wrong, and seek a practical remedy,
have not yet looked beyond the surface
of the speeches, or into the details
of the plans of their principal
men. It suffices that these say they
have found the proper remedy. They
have gained the confidence of followers
merely from evincing a knowledge
of the grounds of complaint, and
giving eloquent expression to their
sympathy. The working-men hardly
discuss the merits of the particular
<i>methods</i> of reform proposed; and they
will follow one or the other class of
leaders as it happens that either succeeds
in captivating them by the arts
of ambition. The difference in the
possible consequences is immense;
but first the leaders, each with his followers,
will act together to break up
the customs, laws, and institutions by
which the interests of the laboring
men are injuriously affected; and not
till they accomplish this against the
common enemy shall we know (unless
we prepare the way) whether the
counsels of infidelity or of Christianity
will be followed in the reconstruction.</p>

<p>The work of determining the tendency
one way or the other is going
on even now. If we scrutinize societies,
institutions, and parties formed
for the purpose of relieving the evils
that poverty causes among the people,
we shall find it easy to class them
under discordant heads. (1) Those
founded by Christian charity, wholly
innocent of any political purpose&mdash;works
of disinterested mercy and brotherly
love. (2) Those invented by
political economists and lawyers, merely
as a means of favoring capitalists
and the personal accumulation of property,
or to suppress pauperism and
vagrancy, such as monopolies, poor-houses,
and the like. (3) Those contrived
from motives of private prudence
and economy only, such as mutual
aid societies, coöperative stores,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_788" id="Page_788">[788]</a></span>
etc. (4) Those proceeding on the
ground that the laboring classes will
never get their just portion of worldly
goods and enjoyments otherwise than
through political action, as, for instance,
the national labor reform party.
(5) The Utopias and secret societies
imagined by infidels.</p>

<p>It is this last-mentioned class whose
theories, acts, and progress compel
us to consider them from a religious
point of view. They are the offspring
of Campanella, of Nicolas of Munster,
and of Giordano Bruno. From
these sprang Bolingbroke, Voltaire,
Rousseau, D'Holbach, and a host of
mere sceptics and speculators like
them. Then came the chiefs of the
French revolution, Marat and Robespierre.
Next, in 1797, Bab&oelig;uf
opposed even Robespierre as being
too backward and aristocratic, and
formed a conspiracy to massacre the
rich, and proclaim sumptuary laws
from a mountain of the slain. After
him appeared Owen, trying to realize
the insane idea of conciliating atheism
with charity. He was followed by
St. Simon, who sought to create another
contradiction, that of an aristocracy
of philanthropists; governors
and princes of equality, who, however,
never found any subjects. Contemporaneously,
Fourier invented a wonderful
scheme for procuring in labor
association the most luxurious pleasures
and licentious indulgences.
Close at his heels came Cabet, continuing
Owen's method on less offensive
conditions. Last of all, Noyes
is trying to conceal the wolf of beastly
promiscuousness under the robe of the
pure lamb of Christian love. These
are the most notorious of those who
may be denounced as the anti-Christian
agitators of the labor question.
Socialism is the name they have inscribed
on their banner; and hence,
since all these inventors and champions
have also been unanimous in
waging war, directly or indirectly,
against Christianity, their socialism
itself should be opposed by all good
Christians.</p>

<p>But, unfortunately, socialism, while
opposing or seeking to undermine
Christianity, succeeds in seducing
many by the promises of sensual enjoyments
she makes. Indeed, the
rationale of every sect or party concerned
in the labor movement begins
with the main proposition which
makes them and even infidel socialism
acceptable to multitudes, namely,
that society or the state is under obligation
to relieve the miseries of the
poor, and if possible to eradicate pauperism
itself. If any deny that society
or the law has done any injustice
to labor&mdash;if, for instance, the legislator
who framed the poor laws thought
the pauper had nobody but himself
to blame&mdash;he nevertheless admits that
pauperism is not merely a personal
misfortune, but a public one; that
pauperism must be regarded as a social
malady or sore, which, though it
may not be radically cured, must and
ought to be treated at least with palliatives,
so as to prevent it from becoming
fatal to the body politic. Thus,
while attempting to exonerate the
state, even the orthodox politician admits
that the body politic is deeply
afflicted by the virus of pauperism,
and therefore himself posits the very
question he would fain ignore. The
poor join issue with him, and argue
that from the day England and North
Germany wrested the care of the poor
from the monasteries, the state assumed
the responsibility of their distress,
and is bound to make such laws as
will radically cure all misery. The
contest is now raging in every direction,
not only on the question of
<em>Who</em> shall take care of the poor,
but <em>How</em> shall they be cared for, and
<em>What</em> are the rights and remedies they
are entitled to?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_789" id="Page_789">[789]</a></span></p>

<p>The origin and object of the controversy
is agreed on by every one.
The dissent is upon what shall be the
principle and the method according
to which the desired relief shall be
gained. Infidelity, under the name
of socialism, would have it done without
God, on grounds of naked natural
equity or rational justice. It would
act independently of religion, Christian
faith and Christian charity. It
would push the church aside, and
presume to finish in another name the
work our Lord Jesus Christ commenced
more than eighteen centuries ago.</p>

<p>Hence, unless one prefers to hide
his head in the sand, with the vain
notion that the immense flood roaring
and rising round us does not exist,
because he does not see or hear it, it
is time for him, if he is a Catholic, to
consider from the point of view of his
faith what stand he should take, and
what is his duty toward the poor and
toward society in the crisis the struggles
of laborers for power in the state
will soon bring on in this country of
universal suffrage. It is not merely
a question of giving and distributing
alms and assistance that is to be solved,
but great problems of social organization
and rights are put before
us. We must decide, (1) what there
is in the labor movement that religion
approves and encourages; (2) what
there is in it religion condemns; and
(3) what it contains that is merely
temporal or indifferent to the church.</p>

<p>It certainly has something of each
of these three elements.</p>

<p>In any way the matter is approached
it presents a religious as well as a
political question to be solved, a religious
as well as a political duty to
be performed; for it involves the
rights of the poor on us, and our
duty to them <em>as Christians</em>. What if
the demands of the laborers were just,
and that, notwithstanding this, we
should oppose them? While socialism,
as a whole, should be opposed,
it is admitted that the present poor-laws
and charitable institutions are insufficient,
and some more thorough
system of relief must be adopted. The
working-men insist that this shall be
done, and for this purpose claim to
elect those who are to govern the
state, and make the laws. Religion
cannot neglect to interfere without
leaving multitudes of souls of the
poor to be seduced into the naturalism,
sensualism, and infidelity the socialists
purpose as the consummation
of the movement. Nor does the question
of our religious duty toward the
poor in this crisis cease to demand
an answer upon a mere refutation of
socialistic theories. It does not suffice
to show that the Utopias of Bab&oelig;uf,
Owen, Cabet, St. Simon, Fourier,
and Noyes are abominable, but
the just principle of economic distribution
must be found and applied
under penalty of eternal anarchy.
The negation of one medicine as unfit
does not dispense from finding
another that will cure, when, indeed,
a disease exists; and we take it for
granted that no Christian who has
heard or read of the successive burdens
and hardships of the poor operatives
and peasants of Europe will
say that there is no disease to be cured,
or who is heartless enough to
abandon the case on the ground that
it is incurable. Certain it is that the
hard-working poor will not concede
that they suffer no injustice&mdash;will not
cease to demand permanent relief;
and if religion ignores, denies, or
abandons the sick, they will resort to
philosophical quacks, who will lead
them to their moral and religious ruin.
Worse; as foreseen by his holiness Pius
IX., they will repeat the apostasy of
the French revolution, and with the
same sacrilegious and despotic spirit,
but with more cunning and method,
prohibit religion itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_790" id="Page_790">[790]</a></span></p>

<p>Their main lever in accomplishing
this will be the labor movement, if they
succeed in controlling it. Hence,
what <em>we</em> shall do with it, is a question
of vital importance.</p>

<p>At the outset the Catholic must
give a negative answer to all propositions
and plans for disturbing <i>vested
rights</i> or violently resisting the laws,
or lawful authority, under pretence of
establishing justice. This proposition
needs no argument to show its wisdom
and conformity with divine law.</p>

<p>Next, the Catholic will oppose agrarianism,
which is the <em>forcible</em> taking
of all property to distribute it in <em>equal</em>
portions among the people. This is
forced equality; a very different thing
from associated labor.</p>

<p>Finally, the Catholic will also even
oppose association when she would
organize corruption and irreligion under
the guise of philanthropy and fraternity.</p>

<p>No doubt these are the features of
the labor movement his holiness Pius
IX. designated under the general title
of socialism when, on the 17th of
June last, in his allocution to the cardinals,
he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Thus, to-day we see on one side revolution,
bringing in her train <span class="smcap">THAT</span> <i>socialism</i>
which repudiates morals and religion and
denies God himself; while on the other
side we behold the faithful and true, who
calmly and firmly expect that good principles
will resume their salutary empire, and
that the merciful designs of Deity will be
realized."</p></blockquote>

<p>The plain duty of lopping off socialism,
and of casting it aside, being
performed, there remains, (1) reform
through just legislation; (2) legal
contracts for mutual relief; (3) coöperation
or association of work-fellows;
and (4) the realization of perfect
Christian charity.</p>

<p>We think we could prove that all the
purely secular remedies&mdash;such as coöoperation,
mutuality, and the like&mdash;are
delusive, and in themselves inadequate;
but it is not our present purpose
to examine this branch of the
subject. A volume would not suffice.
It is only necessary to remark, <i>en
passant</i>, that there is nothing in the
organizations included under the general
name of coöperation contrary
to religion; but at the same time
there is nothing in coöperation that
springs from religion; it is a mere
economic contrivance. It is not a
<em>religious</em> solution of the problem of
social distress; and since we have argued
that religion must be able to
give a temporal as well as a spiritual
answer to the complaints of the poor,
we will pass by all minor and transitional
questions, and consider only
what the earthly Utopia of faith and
charity would be; and inquire what
method might now be adopted to inaugurate
the practical reign of Christian
fellowship, in which the laborer would
necessarily reap the reward he is justly
entitled to.</p>

<p>Yes, religion has also its earthly
new Eden, that will give full satisfaction
to the over-burdened and under-paid
workman. Let us try to picture
it in our imagination, in order to
judge from a study of the ideal whether
it would be possible to make it a
reality. To do this, we should begin
by stating the principles on which this
ideal should be founded; and we
should also mention such historical
facts as may serve to enlighten us on
the practical application of those principles.</p>

<p>The Scriptures and the church teach
that there are degrees of merit, beginning
with that minimum of righteousness
sufficient to save us from damnation.
From that point the degrees
rise one above the other till they ascend
beyond the regions of <i>prohibition</i>
and <i>precept</i> to the realms of <i>counsel</i>
and <i>perfection</i>. There is the man
who is willing to obey God so far
only as to refrain from violating the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_791" id="Page_791">[791]</a></span>
ten commandments. Then there are
those who, besides this, give alms and
do other works of mercy for Christ's
sake; and finally, there are those who,
seeking for the Holy Spirit, labor for
and do works necessary to attain <i>perfection</i>.</p>

<p>Excuse this positing of doctrines
familiar to us all. They are stated
as parts of our argument.</p>

<p>Among the immediate disciples of
Christ there were not only shepherds,
mechanics, fishermen, physicians, and
farmers; but also tradesmen, and even
lawyers and soldiers. Some were
rich, and nevertheless were regarded
as having merited heaven. Zaccheus
is an instance of this class; to please
God, he gave as much as half of his
goods to the poor. He went only
half-way in perfection. It is clear
that if people generally refrained from
committing any of the offences mentioned
in the ten commandments, justice
would reign, and therefore many
social grievances of the worst kind
would disappear. True, this would
not suffice to give affirmative happiness,
but it would be the negation of
positive moral woe. Works of mercy
are necessary to dry all tears; and
charity has the genial warmth that
makes the smile bloom again on the
countenances of those who have wept.
Now, charity is first pity and sympathy;
and then it is sacrifice. It has
beautiful demonstrations of love in
words and demeanor, but it fully realizes
itself in sacrifices; and these
sacrifices are of every extent. Some
are small but cheerfully offered, as the
widow's mite. Some are proportionately
large, as the apportionment Zaccheus
made; but some are unlimited,
as the triple vow of poverty, chastity,
and obedience of the regular clergy.</p>

<p>Jesus said to him, <em>If</em> thou wilt be
<span class="smcap">PERFECT</span>, go, sell what thou hast, and
give to the poor; and thou shalt have
treasure in heaven: and come, and follow
me. (Matt. xix. 21.) Blessed
are ye (willingly) poor, for yours is
the kingdom of God. (Luke vi. 20;
Matt. v. 3.) Where thy treasure is,
there is thy heart also. (Matt. vi. 21.)
You cannot serve God and Mammon.
(Matt. vi. 24.) He who hath left
house, etc., ... for my sake and for the
gospel, ... shall ... receive a hundred
times as much, <em>now in this time</em>;
... and in the world to come life
everlasting. (Mark x. 29, 30.)</p>

<p>From these and numerous similar
speeches of our Lord, and from a spirit
of gratitude, his disciples were inspired
with the desire of attaining perfection.
Those who remained steadfast
notwithstanding the crucifixion,
or rather because of the crucifixion,
gathered around the apostles and pronounced
the vow of poverty. "All
they that believed were together, and
had all things in common." (Acts
ii. 44.)</p>

<p>This is the first instance of <em>real</em>
communism that ever occurred in the
world, and it was the logical product
of the teachings of our Lord and his
apostles. That it was the logical product,
could be easily shown by argument
on the language of Scripture;
but it suffices that it was approved by
Peter and the other apostles. They
knew best; and, indeed, gave example
by becoming members of the
community. That it was the first
instance of real communism, we assert
without forgetting the Essenes, the Lacedemonians,
and the like, from whose
systems it is easy to distinguish the
apostolic community of goods.</p>

<p>And here we ask particular attention
to the grand and glorious trait which
distinguishes Christian <i>reductionism</i><a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
from socialism, agrarianism, coöperation,
and all other worldly plans of
association.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_792" id="Page_792">[792]</a></span></p>
<p>The object of worldly association is
merely to benefit its own members in
secular welfare. It has no outflowing.
It is a partnership for distribution
of products, profits, pleasure, or
knowledge among the members, contributors,
or coöperators only. Thus
it was with the Essenes. The principle
and purpose of their community
of goods was <em>not</em> the extension of its
benefits to the neighbor. They had
and enjoyed their wealth among
themselves exclusively. Their associations
were just as selfish as any
individual; the only difference being
that in one case it is a single person
and in the other a company that is
selfish, and clannishly withholds its
own from the rest of the world. They
did not practise true charity, that charity
which goes beyond home. The
communication of the Essenes began
and <em>ended</em> at home. It did
not, therefore, resemble the Christian
charity described by St. Paul;
they had no idea of it. Modern society
has many examples of participation
like that of the Essenes. The
free-masons and other mutual aid societies
are of this kind.</p>

<p>Of course, reciprocity or coöperation
existed in the apostolic community;
but this was only incidental and
secondary. One of the main elements
of charity is its universality, and therefore
it extends far beyond mere mutuality.
It gives&mdash;it is not a contract
of exchange or insurance. Associations
of the Christian kind do not
limit themselves to themselves. Besides
mutual help, they give help to
any and all men. Indeed, most frequently
Christian charitable institutions
entirely lose sight of any mutuality.
The members, as it were, forget
themselves individually, think of
no restitution, and have their whole
attention and sentiments, with those
of the company, fixed beyond their
own wants and upon the alleviation
of the burdens and pains of the poor
in general. Every reader knows of
many illustrations of this difference.
We need not mention particular cases.</p>

<p>Indeed, the very nature of Christian
charity precludes the limiting of
benefits to the members of a society.
Therefore, the moment any company
resolves to contribute or work for the
purpose of a division among its own
members exclusively, it can have no
claim to be acting on the principle of
charity. Charity ignores any such
distinction; she tends toward all men
indiscriminately; she feels for them
all alike, as brethren and neighbors;
she sympathizes with all; she is spontaneous,
she is expansive, she radiates.
She loves; and her love overflows:
then runs in diverging rills to
every door.</p>

<p>Association recommends itself to
the Christian from other considerations
than those of economy, security
against want, multiplication of productions,
and increase of wealth. He
enters into association to increase his
power with God, to attract grace, to
set up a common defence against sin,
to have the strength of union against
Satan, to have more time and opportunity
to do good, and to do it more
efficiently. The fundamental motive
of the Christian throughout is love
of God and man, piety and mercy.
It is the spirit of sacrifice; it is actuated
by no prospect of self-advantage;
or, at worst, it expects personal
advantage only through and under
the universal good. This was the
absolute self-abnegation and exuberance
of love out of which the apostolic
community spontaneously sprang.</p>

<p>It is an error to suppose that the
primitive Christians abandoned their
community of things upon their first
dispersion or flight from persecution.
(Acts viii. 1.) It continued long afterward,
as we learn from the fathers of
the church. Justin Martyr, (<i>Apol.</i> c. 2,)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_793" id="Page_793">[793]</a></span>
describing Christian society as it was
in his time, (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 150,) says,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We who formerly delighted in adultery,
now observe the strictest chastity; we who
used the charms of magic, have devoted ourselves
to the true God; and we who valued
money and gain above all things, now <i>cast
what we have in common, and distribute to
every man according to his necessities</i>."</p></blockquote>

<p>The writings of other primitive fathers
contain similar passages.</p>

<p>It needs no argument to make a
Catholic see how the <i>solemn</i> vows of
poverty, chastity, and obedience must
be a development or consequence of
the manners and customs of the primitive
Christians. Even in Justin's
time, community of goods was the
prevailing practice among Christians;
but as the faith spread itself widely,
and as whole nations were converted,
the great majority were incapable of
that intense zeal and of those aspiring
sentiments that may achieve perfection.
Those who aimed so high were
in a small minority when counted
apart from the total population; and
they found it necessary to seek freedom
and escape persecution by resorting
to solitude, or to fortify themselves
against the general lukewarmness
by solemn vows, or to resist the
influence of the world by separate association.
Hence, at first, those who
sought to attain perfection fled to the
desert, imitating the ancient prophets.
They were the Theban hermits or
anchorites. Then appeared companionship
in mortification in the unital
homes of the cenobites and monks.
Then, long afterward, came the companies
of militant charity: the Jesuits,
Sisters of Charity, Lazarists, and
many others.</p>

<p>Persons who wish to rise above the
ordinary degree of piety, above the
common level of Catholic practice,
generally attempt full perfection. Animated
by the spirit of self-sacrifice
and an ardent desire to imitate our
Lord, they not only devote themselves
to poverty and obedience, but
also to chastity. They are not content
with less than the three vows, the
fulness of perfection.</p>

<p>Just here, we wish the reader's attention
to an important point, through
which we expect to arrive at a solution
of the questions propounded in the
beginning of this article. It is that,
though generally we see the "three
vows" practised together, we would
be in error if we supposed that they
are inseparable, and that Catholicity
admits only of the two extremes&mdash;the
common level or triple perfection.
On the contrary, among the wonders
and beauties of Catholicity there is
the wonder and the beauty of her
myri-multiform adaptability to the
holy wants of all dispositions, tastes,
and nationalities. The plasticity with
which Catholicity suits herself (without
deterioration and with always an
upward tendency) to every degree
and variety, of practical virtue, is marvellous.
She is, indeed, all things to
all men without ceasing to be the
spouse of Christ. Hence, within her
fold there are, besides the common
law of faith and discipline, multitudes
of approved forms of devotion, giving
egress and exteriority to every
peculiarity of good impulse the soul
may experience. There are saints of
every trade, occupation, habitude, and
condition to be imitated. There are
many kinds of confraternities, sodalities,
societies, and orders&mdash;both lay
and clerical&mdash;formed to accomplish
every good work. The number of
these ways, rules, methods, forms,
and associations is so great, a description
of them all fills volumes.</p>

<p>Sometimes a number of laymen combine
to do a charitable work without
forming any vow. Often they make
only <i>simple</i> vows; but many engage
themselves by <i>solemn</i> vows. In some
cases the counsel of chastity is followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_794" id="Page_794">[794]</a></span>
without that of poverty; the secular
priesthood is an example of this
kind. Sometimes the vow of poverty
has been made without that of celibacy,
as in the case of Ananias and
Saphira.</p>

<p>St. Barnabas, in the first century;
Saints Justin, Julian, and Lucian, in
the second century; Saint Clement
of Alexandria, Tertullian, Origen, and
St. Cyprien, in the third century; and
Arnobius and Lactantius, in the fourth
century, say (Bergier, vol. i. p. 380)
that between Christians all things
were in common; but we easily gather
from other statements and allusions
in their works that they did not mean
a community by <i>virtue of any positive</i>
<span class="smcap">RIGHT</span> or precept. They meant the
generous liberality, the voluntary self-sacrifice,
that characterized the manners
and customs of the Christians.
None asserted conjoint ownership or
other <i>title</i> to their neighbor's property,
nor did any pretend to demand authoritatively,
as the obligation of a
contract, a participation or use exigible
by virtue of the membership of
Christ; but all, actuated by Christian
fellow-feeling, gave spontaneously and
freely, so that none were allowed to
suffer from want of subsistence. The
effect was the same, or better, than if
all things were in common by virtue
of a legal obligation or contract. It
was the same as if all Christians had
made a solemn vow to deprive themselves,
in order to be able to relieve
all cases of suffering poverty they
knew of. The vow of poverty has
no other temporal object. Its theory
is the doctrine of charity, not that of
any natural social right.</p>

<p>Gradually this unmeasured charity
appeared to diminish; for the whole
empire being theoretically though not
practically converted to Christianity,
the Christians at heart were lost in
the immense crowd of merely nominal
believers, and were but partially able
to know each other and communicate.
At the same time, so widely
and deeply corrupt were the people,
even the poor, that <i>charity herself
was forced to be cautious</i>. In fact, the
number of sincere Christians, and
therefore of charitable persons, had
not diminished; but was so small <i>in
proportion</i> to the number of the distressed,
that even by bestowing their
all they could produce no sensible
diminution of the general misery.</p>

<p>The situation was almost identical
with that of the present time; and
the plainest remedy would have been
then, <em>as it would be now</em>, a great augmentation
of the number of Christians
imbued with the spirit of charity
and disposed to self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>The Catholic Church made many
glorious efforts to effect this cure by
increasing the number of the faithful
and true, and by organizing her charitable
agencies. She gave birth to
those missions and institutions by
which the spiritual nature and intention
of Christianity was preserved,
perpetuated, and disseminated, even
through barbarian conquest and feudal
oppression. To be able to devote
themselves to promoting their
own and their neighbor's salvation,
and to help the sick, the oppressed,
and the poor, the members of the
monastic and chivalric orders generally
bound themselves by "three
vows;" and if they ever omitted any
one of the three, it was the vow of
poverty. The holy knights, for instance,
frequently vowed themselves
to chastity and obedience; but not always
to poverty. Chastity and obedience
are not considerably thwarted
by the possession of worldly riches;
and they may without very serious
detriment dispense with the restraints
of poverty: but poverty is very difficult
without chastity; for the hardships
of poverty are grievously multiplied
by the necessity of providing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_795" id="Page_795">[795]</a></span>
for a family. Hence, even in the remotest
times, the orders have added
the vow of chastity to that of poverty.</p>

<p>Doubtless there have been, since
apostolic times, many isolated instances
of the vow of poverty being made
by <i>an entire</i> <span class="smcap">FAMILY</span>. Among the tertiary
or lay brethren of the regular
orders, cases of such a combination
might easily have happened. We take
it for granted that if a husband <em>and</em>
wife make the vow of poverty, they
would (if otherwise correct) be accepted
as a tertiary or lay brother
and sister of any regular order bound
by the three vows, such as the Franciscans,
Jesuits, etc. We know, however,
of only one recorded instance of
there having existed, since apostolic
times, a distinctly and duly organized
congregation, sodality, company, or
community of <em>married</em> Catholics living
under the obligations of a solemn
or even simple vow of poverty. The
schismatics or heretics cannot even
adduce a single instance; for, as already
noted, their societies are not
willingly poor, but the object of their
association is comfort and wealth.</p>

<p>The one instance I refer to is that
of the Jesuit <span class="smcap">REDUCTIONS</span> in Paraguay.</p>

<p>Yet, long before the beautiful results
obtained by the Jesuit fathers in
Paraguay, the good such establishments
might do had been clearly
foreseen by excellent and learned
Catholics. That confessor of the
faith, Sir Thomas More, who was beheaded
by Henry VIII. for refusing
the oath of supremacy, wrote the first
<i>Utopia</i>, founded on the idea of a community
of goods among a whole people.
Since that day the idea has fermented,
and will not allow the world
to rest until it is practically fulfilled
by a <em>Christian</em> people; for it is a
Christian idea, based only on Christian
motives, and wholly impracticable
outside of the Christian religion.
It was to emulate the example set
by the Jesuits that several Christian,
though schismatic or heretical, societies
have been partially successful in
realizing this idea. These are the
Moravians, Rappists, Shakers, and
Ballouists; but we are satisfied the
work of realization must be resumed
by Catholic hands, and with Catholic
motives, and on Catholic grounds, before
it can be permanently and beautifully
successful.</p>

<p>Here several questions present
themselves together:</p>

<p>1. What are the distinctive motives
and grounds of an apostolic reduction
to the rule of community?</p>

<p>2. What essential Catholic conditions
should the organic rule of such
an establishment embody?</p>

<p>3. Would such establishments tend
to disseminate the faith and strengthen
the church?</p>

<p>4. Are the times propitious, and do
surrounding circumstances demand
missionary attention to this matter?</p>

<p>5. Is there place in the economy
of the church militant for the operation
of communities of families having
property in common?</p>

<p>We fear that the editor would not allow
the space necessary for an elaborate
answer to these questions. We will
therefore endeavor to be very brief.</p>

<p>1. A socialist would say that the
only motive for association is a desire
to better our worldly condition; that,
therefore, association is recommendable
only so far as it facilitates increased
production, thorough economy,
equitable distribution, and greater security;
and that it is only by convincing
men of these tangible advantages
that they will be induced to give
up individualism for combinism. So
their phalansteries and familisteries
are nothing but contrivances to save
and gain time, labor, and money for
the benefit of the company, and in rivalry
with, and exclusive of, every other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_796" id="Page_796">[796]</a></span>
company and the remainder of mankind.
It is only the old principle of
self-interest, covetousness, greed of
gain, love of money, exercised by
partnerships or corporations instead
of single persons. Thus, some of
these companies will get very rich,
while others, though burning with
covetousness and discontent, will fall
into great poverty. But besides selfish
motives moving men, there are others
more powerful and certainly more
Christian. For instance, a <em>catholic</em>
community of goods would rest on
directly the opposite of self-interest,
and be induced by charity counteracting
the excess of egoism. True,
as in the other case, association would
be only a means, and also a guarantee
of safety, economy, and increase;
but how different the ulterior object!
The final causes of a catholic "reduction"
to community of goods
would be: (1) to live apart from the
evil example of the world; (2) to sustain
and encourage one another in the
faith and its practices; (3) to secure
the rearing of children in the practice
of religion; (4) to be able to hear
mass oftener, and indulge more frequently
and expansively in prayer and
other sweet and consoling devotions;
(5) to save and increase wealth indeed,
though <em>not for self</em>, not for the
company and its members beyond the
absolute necessities of life, but <em>for external
charity</em>&mdash;distribution among the
poor neighbors, or the establishment
of similar companies; (6) the "reductionists"
(We venture to generalize
the name they had in Paraguay)
would work in a spirit of self-sacrifice
to please God; (7) they would offer
up their voluntary privations as acts
of love, penance, and prayer; (8) they
would be actuated by aspirations to
merit grace and attain perfection; (9)
be moved by a desire to display faith
before the world, and to concentrate
its light so that it might radiate far
and wide; and finally, (10,) they
would cherish the thought that their
zeal might be efficient in strengthening
the influence, facilitating the operations,
and increasing the glory of
the church. What an immense difference
between reductionism and socialism!</p>

<p>2. The essential conditions of such
an association would be the vows of
poverty and obedience, under such
sanctions and guarantees and inspired
by such hopes as only the Catholic
Church can give; and, since the society
would admit persons living in marriage,
and since the church teaches
the indissolubility of the marriage-tie,
the <i>unity of the consent</i> of husband
<em>and</em> wife to the acceptance of these
vows previous to admission. The vow
of poverty would be a <i>sine qua non</i>,
since without it the society would
be liable to the precariousness of all
secular enterprises; and since, also,
without this vow the society would
not have the mark, the trait, the essential
quality that distinguishes disinterested
reductionism from riches-and-comfort-seeking
socialism. The vow
of obedience to a superior authority,
such as a clerical director or a bishop,
is also indispensable. Those who have
had opportunity of observing the
interior operation of a socialist or Protestant
association must be fully
sensible of the importance of this
condition. They are distracted by
divided counsels, inconsistencies of
purpose, obstinacy and pride of opinions,
rival ambitions, and the like.
The end is generally ruin. They
only succeed in proportion to such
<i>modicum</i> of humility and obedience as
they have contrived to incorporate in
their rules and intention. Sometimes
it is only the acknowledged superiority
and energy of character of a founder
or leader that preserves the organization.
As soon as this personage
dies, his creature goes also into dissolution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_797" id="Page_797">[797]</a></span>
Hence, we say the vital conditions
of a "reduction" are, (1) Christian
fervor; (2) Christian humility;
(3) Christian marriage; (4) Christian
poverty, and (5) Catholic obedience.</p>

<p>3. We have before us an account
of the Paraguay missions, from which
we copy the following passage, (p. 52),</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It sometimes happened that the number
thus collected was far too great to admit of
their being received as permanent dwellers
in the 'reduction;' and in this case their instructors
would furnish all that was needed
for <i>the founding of a new one</i>, not only
supplying corn, cattle, and clothing from
their own stores, but giving what, to an Indian,
was most difficult to bestow, their active
and personal coöperation in <i>building a
new 'reduction.'</i>"</p></blockquote>

<p>This extract answers the question
whether such a company would tend
to disseminate the faith and strengthen
the church. The process of increase
would be in geometrical proportion.
Each reduction would have
several offspring, and these, in turn,
would also each evolve several others.
This was the case in Paraguay.
There, in a few years, the reductions
became so numerous that they lined
the banks of the Parana and Uruguay,
extended far into the interior,
and, in the words of an historian,
formed "a Christian republic, where,
far from the dwellings and evil designs
of the colonists, the spirit of
the primitive church revived." Alas!
that this caused the envy and jealousy
of the world of avarice and ambition.
In one more generation, if
the Jesuit fathers had not been banished,
the Christian republic would
have been permanently established.
The glorious example they set
should not remain fruitless. There
is a possibility of similar work and similar
results in the midst of the moral
desert of civilization. It is time that
the shepherds should gather their
lambs into visible and safer folds.
The lambs should not be left to straggle
among the wolves of this moral
wilderness. Surely the fact of these
straggling members of the flock being
married should be no objection to
their being provided with a refuge
when the couple seek it with unity of
will, and would fain find in it the opportunity
of serving God. Surely, the
fructification of such a work would be
wonderful; for its beneficence and
Christian spirit would be so apparent
that thousands of poor Catholics
would eagerly join it, and tens of
thousands of lost sheep would be reconverted
so as to follow the religious
and beautiful life thus made practically
possible. This power of multiplying
themselves, this productiveness by
thirty, seventy, and a hundred fold,
is a peculiarity of this kind of association;
for, while socialistic and
coöperative societies are concentric,
a Christian association or reduction,
by virtue of its voluntary self-privation
and consequent making of a disposable
surplus, and by virtue of its desire
to bestow in charity this surplus, is
evolutive and prolific.</p>

<p>4. Surrounding circumstances in
these times not only demand the attention
of the church to the subject
of association, but the world now offers
facilities which, though very different
from those that existed in Paraguay,
are far more favorable and
congenial. In Paraguay, the reverend
fathers found people capable of
discipline, but barbarous, ignorant, and
suspicious. In civilization to-day, instead
of savage ignorance, we see
foolish infidelity and moral corruption;
but, at the same time, a belief
in the benefits of association is spreading
itself continually. This belief
evinces itself in every direction. It
resolves and attempts a great many
forms of combination. The conviction
that good will flow from the industrial
association of those who labor
is becoming more and more intense.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_798" id="Page_798">[798]</a></span>
Several secular efforts, based
on mere worldly advantage or mutuality,
have proved seriously successful.
The tendency of work and business
is toward the organization of corporations.
The capitalists have set the
example by their monster companies
and monopolies. The plain deduction
is, that this tendency affords a favorable
opportunity for forming reductions.
To neglect it would be to
neglect making all things work together
unto good to such as, according
to God's purpose, are called to be
saints. (Rom. viii. 28.)</p>

<p>5. To say that there is no place
for communities of families in the economy
of the church, would be to deny
her beautiful adaptability to all grades
and varieties of virtue and good works.
That she should reject and oppose
socialism, with its <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cortége</i> of free love,
heresy, blasphemy, covetousness, naturalism,
and woman's dispersion, let
us loudly declare; but to say that
there should be in the system of the
church a place only for such apostolic
communities as are composed of celibates,
would be to condemn her history,
which tells us of the community
at Jerusalem, and of the reductions of
Paraguay. We cannot suppose there
is a grade or kind of real perfection
that the church would reject, if, indeed,
that grade or kind be in conformity
with evangelical counsel. It
is said that keeping the vow of poverty
would be too hard for married
people, who are naturally impelled to
seek riches for the sake of their children.
It is said that parental bias,
solicitude, and duty would create
great obstacles, hard to be overcome.
Supposing this, still we say, all things
are possible <em>with God</em>. The merit of
those who, with God, could conciliate
these two obligations, and accomplish
both, would only be greater in the
eyes of the church. Certainly, no
Catholic will say that the counsels in
regard to voluntary poverty are meant
only for celibates, and that only celibates
are entitled to gain the consequent
blessings. "Blessed are the"
willingly "poor, for theirs is the kingdom
of heaven." Certainly, a man
and wife are entitled to earn the benefits
of this willing poverty as well
as any monk or nun. The married
poor are entitled to make the same
sacrifice and take part in the same
work to enhance the glory of the
church, and to merit the same reward.
Association makes the sacrifice and
the work possible to the celibate. It
creates a similar possibility for married
people. The wondrous powers
of combined labor and economy are
well known. The fields in that direction
are wide and free, and ready for
<em>good</em> seed. Instead of thinking that
associations of married people are in
any wise incompatible with Catholic
doctrine and discipline, a little reflection
will convince us that it is, on the
contrary, the long-neglected link that
completes the circle of good works.
Infidels would fain seize the position,
and try to adapt it to naturalism and
cupidity; but their attempts have
been simply ridiculous. The reason
is obvious: the vow of poverty and
all its consequences is possible only in
and through the motives inspired by
the Christian religion. They cannot
exist and cannot be imitated outside.
True association, that which is productive
of moral good and social
happiness, that which springs from
charity, <em>belongs</em> to Christianity, and it
is impossible to separate it from her.
It was practised by the primitive disciples,
it was praised and taught by
the fathers of the church, it was and
still is fulfilled by the celibates in the
monasteries, it was successfully applied
in the reductions to a whole
people; and we conclude that the
place once occupied by saintly tribes
and families under the wing of the
church is still vacant and open to
their return and reëstablishment.</p>

<h2>THE PRESENT CONDITION OF POLAND.</h2>


<p>America owes a debt of gratitude
to the Polish nation. In the darkest
days of our struggle for independence
many brave Poles came to our assistance.
The name of Pulaski stands
among the most honored names of
the Revolution. To-day we are on
a most friendly footing and possess
much influence with Russia. She is
crushing Poland to the earth in a
manner which is a disgrace to the
nineteenth century. Shall we be silent
when our voice might bring aid
to a noble but unfortunate people,
who generously assisted us in the
hour of need? Justice and gratitude
both forbid.</p>

<p>The unprecedented and truly pitiful
condition to which the former Polish
provinces have been reduced by
Muscovite tyranny makes it a duty,
which we owe likewise to our common
humanity, to direct attention to that
ill-used country, and to illustrate
somewhat in detail the intolerable religious,
political, and social chaos into
which it has been precipitated. The
idea of restoring the ancient Sarmatian
monarchy to its territorial integrity
might justly be deemed Utopian;
but we have still the right to insist, in
the name of every recognized principle
of moral and public law, that the
inconsequence and barbarity with
which Russian Poland, and especially
Congress Poland, is now being treated,
should cease. No one capable of
appreciating the extent of the evil can
fail to perceive that such an anomalous
state of things as there obtains is
absolutely insufferable, and that even
Muscovite brutality cannot much longer
expect to avert another revolution.
The eventualities of the Polish
question demand, therefore, for this
reason alone, the serious and early interference
of the great powers.</p>

<p>To enable the reader to arrive at a
thorough understanding of the question,
it is necessary that we should
commence by casting a brief glance
at the present religious condition of
the country. It is well known that
the Roman Catholic Church, which is
professed by six sevenths of the Christian
and five sevenths of the total population
of the kingdom&mdash;the church
which has the deepest and strongest
hold upon the social and historical
life, the customs and character of the
nation&mdash;has, during the last six years,
been systematically degraded, both <i>de
facto</i> and officially, to the rank of a
mere schism. The Archbishop of Poland,
expressly selected for the primacy
by the Emperor Alexander on account
of his probity and virtues, was
deposed after a twelve months' incumbency
without charges, trial, or
sentence. The sole excuse for this
harsh treatment was that he presumed
to remonstrate against the extreme severity
with which the most trivial political
offences of his countrymen were
punished. The venerable prelate is
now a close prisoner of state in the
interior of Russia. His place in the
archiepiscopal palace is filled by a
Russian, Tschinownik, of the Greek
orthodox stamp, who wields absolute
sway over the "sectarian" churches&mdash;as
the Roman Catholic and the evangelic
are called&mdash;and entertains a select
circle of friends with Russo-French
amateur theatricals in the apartments
in which Tijalewski and Felinski once
meditated and prayed.</p>

<p>The treatment meted out to the
other patriotic bishops has been marked
by a similarly brutal and vindictive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_800" id="Page_800">[800]</a></span>
spirit. Some of them are prisoners
in Siberia; some, like Bishop Lubinski,
have died on the way out; some
languish in foreign exile. Their dioceses
have been conferred on ecclesiastics
who are in the interest of Russia,
and therefore execrated and despised
as traitors by their own countrymen.
All intercourse and dealings
between the Catholic hierarchy in Poland
and the see of Rome have been
interdicted and rendered almost impossible.
With a view of preserving
appearances, a Catholic synod has, by
force and threats, been convened under
the auspices of the imperial government
at St. Petersburg. The members
of this body have been clothed
with jurisdiction in all ecclesiastical
affairs. The lower clergy, stripped of
their revenues and endowments, have
been made dependent on a state subsidy,
which may be withdrawn at
discretion by the temporal authorities.
Laymen, without properly defined duties
and powers, completely ignorant
of the wants and aims of the
church, preside over the priesthood
and prescribe the ritual and the ecclesiastical
discipline. The majority of
the convents and religious houses, as
well as the schools connected with
them, have been closed, and the superintendence
which the religious formerly
exercised over the education
and training of youth has been entirely
taken away. A number of the
finest Roman Catholic church edifices
has been appropriated for the use
of the Greek Orthodox Church, which
has in addition been endowed out of
the property and funds of the former.
The concordat with Rome has been
abrogated, and though the St. Petersburg
cabinet denies that M. de Meyendorff,
its ambassador to the holy
see, told the supreme pontiff to his
face that "Catholicism is synonymous
with revolution," yet the treatment of
the Catholic Church of Poland has
been exactly in accordance with such
a theory. The United Greek Church,
previously on the most cordial terms
with her Roman relative and the Polish
nationality, has been entirely estranged
from Rome, and placed under
the influence of anti-Polish, Russo-maniac
Ruthenians, expressly imported
with this view from Galizia. With such
spiritual guides to direct them, it was
expected that many would be gradually
brought over to the Greek Church, as
had indeed been attempted once before,
but with rather indifferent success,
in Lithuania, during the reign of
the Emperor Nicholas. But we need
not enlarge on this theme. Whole
volumes might be filled with accounts
of the persecutions to which the national
church and her servants have
been subjected by the Russian government.
Who does not still remember
the heart-rending scenes enacted
at Warsaw during the revolutionary
years, when the Cossacks forced their
way into the sanctuaries and dragged
thousands of worshippers from the
steps of the altar to the dungeons of
the citadel, or the still more recent attempt
to compel the Catholic clergy
to perform divine service in the Russian
language? These specimens of
Muscovite tyranny in times of peace
have sent a thrill of horror and loathing
throughout the entire Christian
world, and are still too fresh in the
memory of the living to be forgotten.</p>

<p>Passing from the spiritual administration
of the kingdom to the temporal,
we find it intrusted to a class of
men who are as hostile and foreign
to the nation as to every established
theory of good government. This is
especially the case in the provinces,
where all the authority rests in the
hands of Stock-Russians, natives of a
country whose political and economical
systems, whose physical and historical
life, whose character, customs,
laws, views, ideas, etc., are in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_801" id="Page_801">[801]</a></span>
respect the very opposite to those of
Poland. Selected almost exclusively
from among the subalterns of the
army, their profession has taught them
to laugh at civil and constitutional
guarantees, to disregard the delicately
adjusted and carefully balanced
interests of the community, and it
is therefore not surprising that their
misgovernment should exceed all belief.
Of the wisdom, moderation, and
forbearance which the peculiar state
of affairs in Poland demands, there is
no trace. It matters very little that
Field-Marshal Count Berg, the viceroy
of the kingdom, and some of the generals
who preside over certain branches
of the administration, should personally
be honest, conscientious, well-meaning,
and just men. The training,
antecedents, principles, and habits
of their subordinates are such as
unfit them for civil positions. Yet
this deplorable want of all administrative
talent and experience in the
colonels, captains, and lieutenants
who are appointed to govern the provinces,
does not constitute the greatest
and most serious objection to them.
Besides the very small amount of
intelligence possessed by the average
Russian subaltern, he is noted for
some far more offensive traits. This
class is proverbial for its rapacity, dishonesty,
venality, intemperance, and
immorality; and as every Russian
looks upon himself in the light of a
conqueror among a treacherous, rebellious
people, he naturally regards
all Poles, and especially the refined
and educated among them, as his
personal enemies, whom he only refrains
from plundering and oppressing
so long as he is bribed.</p>

<p>Before the insurrection of 1863, the
administration of the kingdom was in
all essential features autonomic and
distinct from that of the Russian empire,
a privilege which Finland still
enjoys at this day. A minister for
Polish affairs had a place in the St.
Petersburg cabinet, and through his
hands passed all the public business
which the conquered country transacted
with the imperial government
and the sovereign himself. At Warsaw
sat an administrative council, a
kind of Polish ministry, over whose
deliberations the viceroy presided in
person. The members of the Warsaw
administration were also the chiefs
of the several public departments,
such as that of the interior, of justice,
of education, of religion, etc.
Within the last four years the management
of these departments has,
however, been transferred to St. Petersburg,
while the viceroy, in spite
of his title as the representative of
majesty, now only retains a mere
nominal authority. Instead of the
administrative council, an administrative
and even legislative inquisition,
which interferes arbitrarily with the
different branches of the public service,
and completely neutralizes the
viceregal influence, has been established.
This overshadowing power,
the so-called Committee of Organization&mdash;named
thus because it was originally
created to arrange the differences
between the landlords and serfs
which arose out of the emancipation
ukase of 1864&mdash;has usurped supreme
legislative, judicial, and executive
functions, so that without its coöperation
the viceroy is absolutely powerless.
Under the unassuming title of a
corresponding member of the committee,
the celebrated Panslavist, Solowjeff,
is the real leader of the Russian
government at Warsaw, while Count
Berg, the viceroy, has become the
bearer of an empty dignity, and is only
saved from the unpleasant position of
a puppet by his rank as a marshal of
the empire, and commander-in-chief
of the forces in the Warsaw district.</p>

<p>It may well be doubted whether
the civilized world has ever seen such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_802" id="Page_802">[802]</a></span>
military-bureaucratic anarchy as modern
Poland now presents. Those
who witness this state of things from
a distance must find it impossible to
form an adequate conception of the
semi-barbaric, semi-refined confusion
which is its chief characteristic. And
yet, all the wrong, all the injustice,
all the inconsistency of this administrative
chaos, with its long train of
social, political, and religious embarrassments
and entanglements, is outdone
by the interference with a most
holy and inalienable right of not only
every citizen, but of every human being.
That right is the sacred right
of education and instruction, with
which the Russian government has
meddled in a most unwarranted and
despotic manner. The moral violence
to which it has resorted in this matter
outrages every thing that the human
race considers peculiarly sacred
and dear. All the atrocities committed
by heathen tyrants, which history
records, appear insignificant by the
side of the infamous system, deliberately
devised and enforced under a
monarch who advocates progress at
home, while in the affairs of Poland
he is ruled by a terroristic faction that
labors with fanatic zeal for the moral
dismemberment, emasculation, and
degradation of the rising generation
of a vigorous, living, Christian people,
who have shared for more than
ten centuries in the blessings of western
culture.</p>

<p>This language may appear too
strong, but it is more than justified
by the provocation and offence. No
other government but the Russian has,
within historical times, been known
to prohibit, under severe penalties, private
instruction in the elementary
branches and religion in the national
tongue. There is no instance on record
of a civilized state whose rulers
have devoted all their energies to the
suppression and reduction of the number
of existing educational establishments,
or to the discouragement of
attendance at school by raising the
cost of tuition, the price of school-books,
and by generally resorting to
other equally disreputable expedients
for the purpose of rendering the
means of education inaccessible to an
oppressed and impoverished population.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>
It is only in Poland that entire
faculties&mdash;which contained many
foreign professors invited to the country
with assurances of permanent positions&mdash;have
been suddenly ordered
to adopt a strange language insufficiently
developed for scientific purposes;
and no government but the
czar's would have dared to make
non-compliance with such a preposterous
demand a cause for summary
dismissal without compensation. In
no other land would the public schools
have been placed under the control
of individuals notoriously incompetent
in a scientific, educational, social, and
moral point of view for this grave
responsibility; men so little superior
in intellect and manners to the semi-civilized,
non-commissioned officers
under them, that they have frequently
been known to assail the professors in
the presence of their scholars with the
foulest abuse, and even with blows.
Where else, save in Russia, would
public functionaries have overlooked
gross breaches of discipline in the
students, for the sake of tempting
them to disgrace themselves by demonstrations
against the land of their
birth? Where else, save there, could
have originated the monstrous idea
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_803" id="Page_803">[803]</a></span>
of perverting the compositions of
school children so that they appeared
to reflect the darker sides of the national
character; or where else would
these juvenile emanations have been
published to the world as evidences
of the degradation of a whole people?
What other Christian and civilized
government would have stooped to
the incredible infamy of turning the
seminaries for the education of the future
wives and daughters of the land
into schools for coquetry and places
for promiscuous intercourse between
the sexes, in the hope of thus debauching
and demoralizing both the present
and the next generation?</p>

<p>Yet all this, and all that a fiendish
ingenuity could possibly invent or
suggest in the same direction, has actually
been done, openly and in the
broad light of day, by the Russian
government in Poland, more especially
since the middle of the present
decade. To make this tyranny still
more oppressive and hideous, the Polish
child is not allowed to be educated
in its native tongue, but in one
instinctively repulsive to it, difficult to
acquire by reason of its peculiar characters,
and far less adapted to intellectual
uses than the Polish. Not even
religious consolation and instruction&mdash;though
they address themselves to
the holiest feelings of our nature&mdash;are
permitted to reach the oppressed people
in any language but the abhorred
Russian. A terrorism like this
acts with the effects of poisonous dew
upon excitable temperaments, and explains
how the most exemplary piety
and the fiercest thirst for vengeance
may dwell side by side in the national
heart. To crown, as it were, these
wrongs and insults, the Russian authorities
have lately forbidden the pupils
of the public schools to speak
their own language even during the
hours allotted for play. The design,
of course, is to completely Russianize
the young Polish generation. It is
for the same reason that the pupils
of the public schools are compelled
to wear a Russian uniform, and to salute,
after the fashion of private soldiers,
every military officer whom they
may happen to encounter in-doors or
out. That no Polish father or mother
may easily evade the pernicious effects
which such an education as the
public schools afford must exert upon
their offspring, the refined absolutism
of Russia has taken care to discourage
by all means in its power the
employment of private tutors and attendance
at foreign institutions of
learning. First, no government appointment,
not even the most petty
and least remunerative post, can be
obtained unless the candidate understands
Russian; and, as there is a
great dearth of private tutors, who
are either natives of Russia or who
have mastered its language, a large
majority of the Polish children are indirectly
compelled to go to the public
schools, where the only branch
of study thoroughly cultivated is the
Russian literature and language. Then
every conceivable obstacle has been
placed in the way of the employment
of private instructors, either natives
or foreigners, even by those families
who could otherwise afford the expense.
Under the reign of Nicholas,
foreign professors and teachers were
almost banished from the country,
and those who had not the official
influence necessary to evade the law,
were obliged to bring them across
the frontier in the disguise of servants
after having bribed the police and the
custom-house officials. This rule has
been made still more stringent of
late. No private instructor is allowed
to follow his calling until he has first
submitted to an examination in the
Russian language&mdash;the sole test of
proficiency and qualification&mdash;before
a government board expressly instituted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_804" id="Page_804">[804]</a></span>
for this purpose; and the result
is, that hundreds of foreigners have
resigned their places and left the
country. The surveillance of the
police is carried to an extent which
can hardly be credited abroad, and
their espionage makes any evasion of
the interdict difficult, if not impossible.
To keep the children of all save the
wealthiest parents from being sent
abroad for an education, the price of
passports has been raised to a figure
which virtually amounts to a total
prohibition of foreign residence and
travel.</p>

<p>These few unvarnished facts may
suffice to give the reader a faint conception
of the present state of domestic
and social life in Poland. The
child, bred from infancy in accordance
with certain specific national
customs and habits, in disposition,
speech, thought, sentiment, and expression,
moulded in a decidedly
Polish, Roman Catholic, West-European
form, is, upon its admission to
school, forced not merely to reject all
it has imbibed with its mother's milk,
but to accept the very opposite of what
nature and duty have taught it to hold
sacred at home. With the Russian
school uniform&mdash;the badge of degradation
and slavery&mdash;the Polish boy is
expected to put on a manner and
speech hostile to his nationality and
religion; for upon his doing so depends
both his own success in life
and the safety of his parents. Must
not all piety and loyalty, under such
an accursed system, all manhood and
morality, be destroyed, and the character
of the entire people deteriorate?
After ten years or more of
this training and preparation, the boy
becomes a man. Two roads through
life now open before him: he either
enters the service of the state, in
which case he becomes so thoroughly
Russianized that he continues in all
essential features to live up to the
system of the school, and hardens
gradually into a genuine Tschinownik;
or he returns home to ripen into
a conspirator and plotter. Is it then
surprising that such a course of education
should have made the number
of shipwrecked Catilinian existences
so much larger in Poland than in any
other land? Is it strange that under
such a government the national prosperity,
which might otherwise be susceptible
of great development, should
steadily decline, and be replaced by
an augmenting wretchedness?</p>

<p>Did we not know that at any time violent
political catastrophes may occur
and impart to the current of things a
direction different to that which a majority
of professional and non-professional
politicians anticipate, we might
easily predict to what such a state of society
must inevitably lead. But irrespective
of the possibility, even the probability,
of great political complications,
which would prevent the coöperation
of the three-partite powers
hereafter, there lies, despite its weaknesses
and faults, a vitality and capacity
of resistance in the Polish nationality
that spurns unconditionally the
supposition of such an extermination
as the one attempted by Russia; and
this it will be well to consider in every
attempt for the reconstruction of
the country. When a nation is to
disappear and be absorbed by another,
this task can only be accomplished
when it is fused with a nation
physically and mentally its superior.
Such is, however, far from being the
case in the present instance. The Russian
nationality, as its colonization
experiments in Lithuania have sufficiently
demonstrated, can send only
smaller, never larger masses into Poland,
and the assimilative capacities
of the Polish nationality are, in spite
of its political subjection, so preponderating,
by reason of a superior culture,
that the Russians will much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_805" id="Page_805">[805]</a></span>
sooner become Poles, than the Poles
will become Russians. All the ukases,
all the religious and educational
tyranny and injustice, all the bayonet
rule and oppression of the latter can
never bridge the gulf between the
two peoples. The Russification of
Poland is, and must always remain, a
physical and moral impossibility which
no Murawieffs, Katkoffs, or Solowieffs,
can hope to bring about. An imperfect,
hastily-prepared insurrection,
commanded by inexperienced leaders,
nearly destitute of arms and resources,
defied the Russian colossus nearly a
year and a half. And even for this
tardy victory over a country of five
millions of inhabitants, who had been
for more than a decade governed by
martial law, Russia was chiefly indebted
to the passive attitude of the
neighboring states; for, had either
Austria or Prussia abandoned their
neutrality, the insurrection would yet
be alive. The alleged right and mission
of the czars to govern the Poles
are actually and morally as unfounded
as they are politically and legally
an insult to the age and to the law
of civilized nations.</p>

<h2>
FRIEDEMANN BACH.</h2>

<h3>PART FIRST.<br />
</h3>


<p>On New Year's eve of the year
1736, a brilliant company was assembled
in the <i>salons</i> of the Count von
Bruhl, lord premier to the Elector of
Saxony. The mansion, opposite the
castle in Dresden, was illuminated so
brightly that the whole street in front
was light as day. In a shadow of
the castle wall stood a man wrapped
in a cloak, gazing up at the windows,
behind which could be seen the gay
confusion of guests. Presently one&mdash;a
lady splendidly dressed&mdash;came close
to one of the windows, opened it, and
stepped out upon the balcony. The
light gleamed on the jewels in her
coronet. She stood but an instant in
the air, being called back; the window
was closed, and she was lost in
the throng.</p>

<p>The solitary watcher outside, with
a deeply-drawn sigh, turned to depart.
His hand was seized as he did
so by a passer-by&mdash;a man in the dress
of the court pages.</p>

<p>"Good evening!" cried a cheery
voice. "How glad I am to find you
at last! What were you doing here?"</p>

<p>The other laughed, evading an answer,
and, drawing his cloak about
him, complained of the cold.</p>

<p>"Come to Seconda's!" cried the
page. "You will find plenty of hot
punch there."</p>

<p>The two walked on to the celebrated
Italian restaurant near the old
market. The scene there was as brilliant
as at the premier's. A gay company
was assembled in the largest
room, where the new-comers took
seats at the table. As they threw off
their hats and cloaks, the page was
seen to be a man of about forty years
of age, with a face deeply lined with
the marks of free living. His eyes
were bright and merry, and his mouth
was liberal in smiles. His companion
was a strikingly handsome man of
twenty-five, with a pale and haughty
countenance, and a form well proportioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_806" id="Page_806">[806]</a></span>
and majestic. His expression
was grave, and a satirical curl was in
his lip when he spoke; his large, dark
eyes were now fiercely flashing, now
dreamy and melancholy, and they
were often downcast and shaded by
long, heavy lashes.</p>

<p>"You are dull to-night, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon ami</i>!"
cried the jovial page, whose name
was Von Scherbitz. "Banish your
gloom; it is no time for it."</p>

<p>"Have patience with me," said
the young man in a low tone, and
with an attempt at a laugh. "I cannot
always keep even with you. I
have served but a two years' brotherhood,
you know."</p>

<p>"In our club, yes; yet <em>one</em> year
has spread your fame in music over
all Europe! Friedemann Bach has
but one rival in renown&mdash;the admirable
Sebastian!"</p>

<p>A flush mounted to the young
man's brow.</p>

<p>"Call him not a rival!" he exclaimed.
"I have to thank my father for
all I have ever done; and I feel my
own insignificance beside his greatness.
I feel, too, how unworthy I am
of his love."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" cried Scherbitz.
"Your good father is strict, perhaps;
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pourquoi</i>? he is old; you are young
and impetuous; you have your liberal
ideas and your adventures, and
keep them from his knowledge, to
spare him chagrin. Where is the harm
in this?"</p>

<p>Friedemann was leaning his head
on his hand, which he passed slowly
across his forehead, as if waving
away the trouble of discussing the
point. The punch was placed before
them, and the tankards were filled.
The guests at the round table drank,
as they did; and others came in;
among them military officers, painters,
and musicians. As a party of distinguished-looking
persons entered, the
page rose to greet one of them, calling
him "Signor Hasse." The gentleman
glanced around the company,
but declined a seat at the table, retreating
to a distant corner. Here
he bade the waiter remove the light
from a small table in front of him,
and bring him supper by himself.</p>

<p>The page called Friedemann's attention
to the solitude and gloom
chosen by the famous musician. Yet
he was well known to be fond of
good company, and was universally
respected.</p>

<p>"Is it on account of his wife?"
asked young Bach.</p>

<p>"Exactly; the brilliant Faustina
Hasse, the admired singer, the idolized
of all Dresden. They do not live
happily."</p>

<p>"You cannot help seeing," observed
Friedemann, "that strength is
wanting in his character&mdash;it is wanting
in his compositions. They have
softness and melody; but how little
of manly power!"</p>

<p>"Yet he is the favorite composer in
the world of fashion."</p>

<p>More guests came in, and the
general merriment waxed loud. The
glasses were rapidly filled and emptied.
The conversation among the
younger part of the company was
that of jovial revellers, intent on as
much amusement as they could obtain
out of a gayly-dressed officer of
the elector's guard, and a chamberlain
he had brought in to serve as a
butt for their jokes. Friedemann observed
them with haughty gravity,
stealing a glance now and then at
Signor Hasse in his corner.</p>

<p>The chamberlain was flippant with
tales of court scandal, at which there
were uproarious bursts of laughter.
Presently, half-drunk, he was reciting
some verses; and at the close he
filled his glass and toasted Signora
Hasse.</p>

<p>All were silent as Hasse rose and
approached the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_807" id="Page_807">[807]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he said with dignity,
"I have the honor to wish you all a
good evening, and farewell. To-morrow
morning I leave Dresden."</p>

<p>"To go whither?" asked Scherbitz.</p>

<p>"To Italy."</p>

<p>The company knew by his tone
that he meant not to return. There
was a moment's deep silence, and
then an officer asked:</p>

<p>"Does the signora go with you?"</p>

<p>"No; she remains in Dresden," replied
the composer.</p>

<p>Hasse then turned to Friedemann,
and grasped his hand.</p>

<p>"Commend me to your father,
Monsieur Bach," he said warmly.
"Tell him he shall yet hear something
good of Scarlatti's disciple."</p>

<p>There was a faltering in his tone
as he spoke these last words, and
turning away, he left the room. Friedemann
sighed deeply as he looked after
him, and pushed away his glass,
which Scherbitz had just filled.</p>

<p>The merry company was again convulsed
with the sallies of the intoxicated
chamberlain; and loud applause,
cries of "bravo!" and toast
after toast urged him on. When he
fell back, helplessly drunk, the young
men pulled off his court dress, put
on a dark one, carried him out, and
gave him to the watch as a drunken
vagabond to be taken to the guard-house.
Then they laughed to think
of his consternation at finding himself
in the cold cell, on New Year's
morning.</p>

<p>Midnight struck in the midst of
this boisterous revelry; the last hour
of the dying year. There was a wild
storm without, and clamorous shouting
and singing within. The revellers
reeled homeward; young Bach,
the only one whose gait was steady,
though he had drunk as deeply and
as madly as the rest.</p>

<p>When he rose on the following
morning, he saw a letter on his table,
in a well-known hand, which he quietly
opened and read with deep emotion.
Then he began to pace up and
down the room, till the door was abruptly
opened and Scherbitz came in,
wishing him the compliments of the
season. He read the letter Friedemann
handed him in silence.</p>

<p>"A charming old gentleman is that
good papa of yours," he said as he
gave it back. "His heart is full of
kindness. May his life be long and
happy! But look not so woe-begone,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon ami</i>! How is it possible for
you to satisfy the claims of such exalted,
old-fashioned virtue? The time
will come when we, madcaps as we
are, shall be pointed out as models
of propriety for our juniors. Let the
wheel of time roll on."</p>

<p>"To crush us in the dust!" moaned
Friedemann.</p>

<p>"Look at me&mdash;a page forty years
old! I have no fear of reverse as
long as I serve my lord faithfully. I
might have stood up heroically against
the all-powerful minister, and I should
have been hailed as one of her deliverers
by my country; but I kept
my place and pension, and remain
a page in comfortable quarters."</p>

<p>"You are not the first whose life is
a failure."</p>

<p>"Nor shall I be the last. Why
should I despair? Come, be reasonable,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon ami</i>! you are too self-condemnatory.
Have you forgotten
Handel, whom you welcomed here
three years since?"</p>

<p>"How could I forget him?"</p>

<p>"Yet Handel is unlike your father.
His fantasy is more powerful, his
force more developed; he soars like
an eagle, while Sebastian Bach sails
over the calm waters like a majestic
swan. Bach's activity is calm, silent&mdash;the
offspring of concentrated thought.
Handel reaches his aim amid storm
and tumult&mdash;through strife to victory.
Can you blame him for the difference?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_808" id="Page_808">[808]</a></span>
His path is your own. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">En avant,
mon ami!</i>"</p>

<p>"Handel has had, indeed, a restless
and stormy life," replied Friedemann;
"but he has never lost himself."</p>

<p>"Had he been born in the present
century, instead of the last, his views
might have been more liberal. Before
he was of your age, he did as
others do. Faustina Hasse could
tell you some wild tales&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He never played the hypocrite
to his father!" said Friedemann bitterly.</p>

<p>"It was not worth while. Now,
my good fellow, do not flatter yourself
you can deceive a page forty
years old. Your so-called profligacy
and keen self-reproach have another
cause than that you choose to assign.
You dread the unmasking of what
you term your hypocrisy less than the
discovery of another secret!"</p>

<p>Friedemann started to his feet, and
his face glowed like fire. The page
laughed.</p>

<p>"You must govern your eyes better,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon ami</i>, if you want to keep your
secret when you hear the name of
'Natalie.' I did not need to witness
your behavior last night opposite the
minister's palace, to show me the
truth!"</p>

<p>Friedemann was now pale as death.
With a violent effort he mastered his
feelings, and said,</p>

<p>"You will be silent, will you not?"</p>

<p>"As the grave&mdash;assuredly! Only
be cautious before others. No more!
I am going to the guard-house to release
the victim chamberlain. Now
go to church, and afterward come to
Seconda's to breakfast. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Au revoir!</i>"
And Scherbitz went out.</p>

<p>Friedemann Bach had been organist
of the church of St. Sophia since
the elector, at the solicitation of his
father that he would befriend his boy,
had given him the appointment. He
hurried to his post, and splendidly
performed his part in the imposing
service. As the last tones of the organ
died along the vast arches, he
arose, closed the instrument, and descended
from the choir. At the door
a pair of vigorous arms were flung
around him, and, with a joyful cry, he
embraced his father.</p>

<p>The old man pronounced a solemn
blessing as he pressed his son to his
heart, and warmly praised his morning's
work. He had entered the
church alone, to enjoy the music of
his dearest pupil, whom he now declared
his best.</p>

<p>"To your lodgings now, Master
Court-organist!" he cried. "Philip is
there, and unpacking. We shall stay
a week with you." He took his son's
arm, and walked on, talking pleasantly
all the time.</p>

<p>Philip Emmanuel Bach had grown
a stately youth and a ripe scholar in his
art since Friedemann had left the paternal
home at Leipzig, three years
before. They chatted of the old
times, when their mother in her
snowy cap and apron smiled on their
boyish sport; when they roasted apples
on the stove of Dutch tiles, and
their young sisters chid them, and the
little Christopher laughed at them
from his mother's lap. Philip had
been lonely at school, and was delighted
at these reminiscences. The
two sons sympathized with the triumph
of the good Sebastian when he
told them again of his first summons
to Dresden, of the note that had come
to him from the Minister von Bruhl,
on the part of the Elector Augustus
of Saxony and Poland: an invitation
to play at the church in Dresden.
The rector in Leipzig had opposed
the departure of the organist of St.
Thomas's school; but the elector's
own carriage stood at Bach's door to
fetch him, and he saw future good for
both his sons. He felt that through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_809" id="Page_809">[809]</a></span>
them the lovers of Hasse should hear
music more sublime than the voluptuous
melodies of Italy. Then the
reception at Dresden; the entrance
of the elector into the choir to greet
Bach; his words, "O master! if I
might hear you play thus at the hour
of my death"&mdash;all the scene was
lived over by the grateful old man.
Philip, then a stripling, remembered
how a beautiful lady&mdash;the famous
Faustina Hasse&mdash;had rushed in, and,
weeping, had kissed his father's hand;
Hasse's greeting too, he remembered;
and the elector's bidding to ask any
favor at his hands.</p>

<p>These recollections and the conversation
were interrupted by the entrance
of a servant in a rich livery, who presented
a note to Friedemann. The
young man blushed as he took the
note, which he opened and read hastily.</p>

<p>"I will come," he said to the servant,
"at the hour named."</p>

<p>The man withdrew.</p>

<p>Sebastian smiled.</p>

<p>"Our court-organist," he said, "appears
to have distinguished acquaintances."</p>

<p>"The livery was the lord premier's,"
remarked Philip.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" asked Sebastian. "You
know his excellency, my son?"</p>

<p>"The note came from his niece,
the Countess Natalie," answered
Friedemann, in a confusion which he
could not conceal.</p>

<p>"And you visit the young countess?"</p>

<p>"She is my pupil in music. She
has sent for me to arrange a concert,
which she is to give on her aunt's
birthday."</p>

<p>"I thought M. Hasse managed all
those matters."</p>

<p>"I can't well avoid the commission;
and such things help one's reputation,"
faltered the young man. "As to M.
Hasse, he has left Dresden."</p>

<p>"Hasse gone&mdash;the excellent Hasse!"
exclaimed Sebastian.</p>

<p>The good, pious composer was
grieved to hear of his unhappiness.
Then, changing the subject, he began
innocently to advise his son as to the
polished manners necessary in the
house of the premier. Friedemann
pressed his hand and thanked his unsuspecting
monitor.</p>

<p>When the elder Bach asked what
he had done lately in music, Friedemann
replied that what he had done
did not satisfy him. His father put
aside his plea that the highest and
best could alone avail in art.</p>

<p>"We have not reached that," he
said; "yet we can rejoice in the success
granted us. There is much that
I like in your <i>Fughetten</i>."</p>

<p>From music he passed to other
questions; and asked, smiling, how
long the court-organist meant to remain
unmarried.</p>

<p>"Dear father, I need not be in
haste."</p>

<p>"'Early wooed has naught rued.'"</p>

<p>"It is a serious step, father."</p>

<p>"Surely, and not to be taken precipitately;
but, dear son, let it not be
long. If my first grandchild is a boy,
I will teach him music. Ay, marriage
is a serious matter! I have
toiled hard to give bread to my boys
and girls, and brought you all up&mdash;have
I not?&mdash;to be good men and
skilful artists. From my great-grandfather,
all the Bachs have had
musical talent. I was once ambitious,
my boy, to write something that
might win enduring fame. Now, I
have but one wish. It is&mdash;that all the
Bachs may meet in the kingdom of
heaven, and join in singing to the
glory of God, among the hallelujahs
of the angels! Friedemann, child
of my heart, let me not miss you
there!"</p>

<p>With a sob of anguish, Friedemann
sank at his father's feet. Sebastian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_810" id="Page_810">[810]</a></span>
laid both hands on his head, saying
devoutly,</p>

<p>"God's peace be with you, my son,
now and for ever!"</p>

<p>Unable to control his agitation&mdash;which
his pious father thought a burst
of filial emotion&mdash;Friedemann left the
room. Closing the door softly, he
rushed through the hall, out of the
house, and through the streets to the
open country, where he flung himself
on the frozen earth and wept aloud.</p>

<p>At dinner the father conversed with
his two sons, and much was said of
the splendors of the Polish-Saxon
court under the administration of the
luxurious and prodigal Count von
Bruhl. It was then time for Friedemann
to go to the minister's palace.
He changed his dress and hastened
there.</p>

<p>As he passed into the hall, the door
of one of the side-rooms opened, and
the premier came out. He was a
small man, with marked and expressive
features, and keen, clear blue
eyes. He was sumptuously dressed,
and wore a star on his breast. Friedemann
stopped and bowed to him.</p>

<p>"Good day, M. Bach, and a happy
new year!" said the minister in bland,
soft tones. "My niece has sent for
you. I am pleased with your promptness.
I am grateful for your readiness
to meet our wishes at all times,
and shall remember it. The countess
expects you!"</p>

<p>He nodded, smiled graciously, and
walked lightly out of the front door,
entering his carriage, which presently
drove away.</p>

<p>Friedemann looked after him apprehensively.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" he murmured.
"The smile of that man ever
bodes disaster. Let it be so! What
can make me more miserable than I
am?"</p>

<p>Crossing the hall, he passed on
through one of the galleries.</p>

<p>A female servant stood at the door
of the ante-room of the countess's
cabinet. She opened the door of the
inner room, and Bach entered.</p>

<p>A young girl of about twenty, in a
costume coquettishly pretty, reclined
on a sofa. Her form and her face were
both beautiful; a nose slightly aquiline,
and well-defined eye-brows, gave
her features a character of pride and
decision, contradicted by the soft tenderness
of the full, rosy lips, and the
languishing, violet eyes, shaded by
their long lashes. Her hair floated in
golden curls over her neck. A faint
rose-tint came to her pale cheeks as
she rose to receive Friedemann.</p>

<p>The young man stood still, and
did not raise his eyes. The countess
came nearer, laid her little white hand
on his shoulder, and said, almost tenderly,</p>

<p>"What were you doing, Bach, opposite
our house last night?"</p>

<p>One glance Friedemann darted from
his flashing eyes into her own, but
made no other answer.</p>

<p>"I saw you plainly," said Natalie,
"as I stepped out on the balcony.
You were leaning against the castle
wall. Were you waiting for any one?
Tell me."</p>

<p>The young man shivered with the
violent emotion that shook his whole
frame. After a pause, he said with
forced calmness,</p>

<p>"You sent for me, most gracious
countess, to honor me with your commands
respecting the arrangement of
a concert."</p>

<p>The countess turned angrily away.</p>

<p>"These are my thanks, proud man,
for my trust, for my love. Out upon
ingratitude!" she cried.</p>

<p>The young man flushed crimson at
these reproachful words.</p>

<p>"What can I say?" he answered in
a deep, hoarse voice, full of the wild
agony he was vainly striving to repress.
"Look at me, and enjoy your triumph!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_811" id="Page_811">[811]</a></span>
You have made me wretched.
Leave me the only consolation that
remains&mdash;the conviction that I suffer
alone!"</p>

<p>"Friedemann," said the countess,
shocked to see him thus, "compose
yourself, I entreat you! Spare me!"</p>

<p>"I will <em>not</em> spare you!" burst forth
Friedemann, unable longer to master
his agitation. "You have torn open
my bleeding heart-wounds in cruel
sport! I will not spare you! I have
bought the right to speak with my
happiness here and hereafter. I gave
you all, Natalie&mdash;truth for falsehood,
pure, faithful love for frivolous, heartless
mockery!"</p>

<p>"I did not mock you!" cried Natalie.</p>

<p>"Did you love me, then?"</p>

<p>"I can not answer that."</p>

<p>"Tell me, Natalie&mdash;did you love
me?"</p>

<p>"What good can it do? Are we
not parted for ever?"</p>

<p>"No; by my soul, <em>no</em>! Nothing
shall part us if you love me! But, I
must be convinced of that. If you
have not&mdash;if you do not&mdash;I ask you,
why did you tempt the free-hearted
youth, who lived but for his art, with
encouraging looks and flattering
words?"</p>

<p>"Be silent!" cried the girl.</p>

<p>Friedemann's burst of grief was
convulsive, and he covered his face
with his hands.</p>

<p>At length Natalie said,</p>

<p>"I honored your genius&mdash;your
heart&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You loved me not then, and you
do not love me now. If you love me,
how can you bear to think of becoming
the wife of another?"</p>

<p>"Alas! you know; my station, the
will of my uncle&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>My</em> happiness, <em>my</em> peace is nothing
to you?"</p>

<p>"My affection is still yours. I
shall never love another. Will not
that content you?"</p>

<p>Friedemann's pale face crimsoned;
he stamped his foot fiercely.</p>

<p>"Hypocrite! liar! coward that I
am," he cried; "and all for a coquette!"</p>

<p>Natalie protested against his injustice.
She reminded him of her history:
her noble birth and orphaned
condition; the state and splendor
with which her uncle had surrounded
her; her scorn of mere pomp and
luxury; her isolation in the midst of
flatterers and smiling fools; her discernment
of the manhood in him&mdash;her
lover.</p>

<p>"Then be my wife, Natalie!"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"You will not? You will marry
the creature of your uncle, whom you
regard with aversion?"</p>

<p>"You know, Friedemann, I do not
take this step from interest, but a sense
of duty."</p>

<p>"Duty! Toward whom?"</p>

<p>"Yourself! I could never be happy,
nor make you happy, as your wife.
You are a great artist; but you can
never rise to my sphere. And should
I sacrifice all for you, would not my
incensed uncle pursue us with his vengeance?
If we found shelter in solitude,
how long would you or I bear
this concealment?"</p>

<p>Friedemann grew pale, and looked
down.</p>

<p>"We could not be happy," resumed
the countess. "All I can do is to
keep my heart for you. You can live
for your art and me."</p>

<p>"And love you in secret?" asked
the young man bitterly.</p>

<p>"I would bear condemnation for
your sake."</p>

<p>"You shall <em>not</em>! The woman for
whose sake I am miserable, for whom
I have deceived father, brother, friends,
shall never know the world's scorn.
Farewell, Natalie! We never meet
again. Be unlike your future husband&mdash;be
noble and true. Crushed
as I am, you shall yet esteem me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_812" id="Page_812">[812]</a></span>
knowing that all virtuous resolution
has not left my heart!"</p>

<p>"O Friedemann! how I honor and
admire you," exclaimed the weeping
girl, as she flung her arms around his
neck.</p>

<p>The maid entered quickly, announcing
the minister.</p>

<p>Natalie retreated to the sofa.</p>

<p>"Ha! M. Bach," said the count, as
he came in. "I am delighted to see
you again."</p>

<p>"Is it all arranged about the concert,
my dear niece?"</p>

<p>"I hope so, uncle," answered Natalie.</p>

<p>"Charming, charming! Madame
von Bruhl will be enchanted, M. Bach.
You will certainly arrange all for the
best. Come very often to visit us;
very often. I assure you, my highest
esteem is yours."</p>

<p>Friedemann, somewhat bewildered,
bowed his thanks, and took leave.
The minister looked after him, while
he took a pinch from his jewelled
snuff-box.</p>

<p>"He has great, very great talent,"
he said musingly; and added other
praises. Then he chatted a little on
other subjects, and, looking at his
watch, touched the white forehead of
his niece with his lips, suffered her to
kiss his hand, and retired from the
room.</p>

<p>Friedemann left the house with confused
thoughts. Suddenly M. Scherbitz
ran round the corner, and seized
his hand.</p>

<p>"I am going home," said young
Bach.</p>

<p>"You are not! Come instantly
with me to Faustina Hasse's."</p>

<p>"Are you mad?"</p>

<p>"Not so near it as yourself, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon
ami</i>! The blind bird will not see the
trap."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sacré bleu!</i> Come to Faustina's
with me, or you are to-night on the
road to Königstein. The lord minister
knows all!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All that afternoon Sebastian had
spent in reading the latest exercises
and compositions of his son Friedemann,
handing sheet after sheet,
when he had read it, to Philip. They
called for lights as dusk came on.
At length Sebastian asked his younger
son what he thought of his brother.</p>

<p>Philip knew not what to answer.</p>

<p>"I admire Friedemann," he said.
"His works move me. I seem at
times to be reading your music, father;
then comes something strange and
different. I feel disturbed&mdash;I can not
tell why. I like these compositions;
but they give me not untroubled
pleasure."</p>

<p>"You are right, Philip," said Sebastian,
with a grave and thoughtful
smile. "His works have something
in them strange and paradoxical. I
find this in his sketches more than
in his elaborate compositions. But I
am not disturbed thereby: I rejoice."</p>

<p>Philip looked surprised.</p>

<p>"Your own light, glad spirit, Philip,
accords not with the earnest, oft
gloomy character of Friedemann's
works. He is not yet settled. There
is something great in him, hardly yet
developed; the form of expression is
not defined. Friedemann seeks a new
path to the goal. Every strong spirit
has done so. Art ever advances, and
her temple is not yet finished. The
perfect dwells not on earth."</p>

<p>Philip suggested that his brother's
imagination, supplying nobler images
than his industry had produced, still
soared beyond the reach of practical
achievement, and thus left him unsatisfied.</p>

<p>There was a loud knock at the
door; two men entered, asked for the
court-organist, and, hearing that he
was expected every moment, sat down
to wait for him. Sebastian tried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_813" id="Page_813">[813]</a></span>
enter into conversation with them;
but their gruff monosyllables repelled
him, and an awkward silence ensued.
In about fifteen minutes the door
was opened unceremoniously, and M.
von Scherbitz entered. He saluted
the elder Bach and looked keenly at
the two strangers. He then announced
his name to the astonished Sebastian,
and said he was Friedemann's
friend.</p>

<p>"He will soon return," said the
father; "these gentlemen, also his
friends, are waiting for him."</p>

<p>"Friends!" echoed the page; and
placing himself in front of the two
men, he gazed at them searchingly.
After a while he said,</p>

<p>"Messieurs, his excellency has lost
no time in sending you, I perceive;
but you are too late. Give the lord
minister the compliments of the page,
M. von Scherbitz, and tell him he
will find the court-organist, M. Bach,
at the house of Signora Hasse. I
have just had the honor of leaving
him there. He will see the elector."</p>

<p>The two men started up without
speaking, and hastily left the room.
The page threw himself into a chair
and laughed long and loudly. The
father and son stood in blank surprise,
not knowing what to make of the
scene.</p>

<p>At last Scherbitz recovered his composure.
He addressed Sebastian, and
said he had something to communicate
to him in private.</p>

<p>"But where is Friedemann?" asked
both father and son.</p>

<p>"As I said, at the house of Signora
Hasse."</p>

<p>"What does he there?" asked the
father.</p>

<p>"That is what I came to tell you."</p>

<p>Philip was sent out of the room.
Sebastian seated himself, and with
dignity inquired what the gentleman
who called himself Friedemann's friend
had to communicate.</p>

<p>"I am his friend," replied the page,
"and have proved it not for the first
time to-day."</p>

<p>"And those two strangers&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Were officers sent to arrest him."</p>

<p>The page went on to tell his story,
the bold levity of his manner somewhat
subdued before the dignity of
the excellent old man, who sat with
his clear, searching eyes fastened upon
him. He began with a preamble
about the strict manner in which Sebastian
had brought up his sons, and
the difference between Friedemann
and his brothers. "You are too innocent
of knowing the world," he
continued, "to be able to shield him
against all the dangers that beset the
path of youth. Till he came to Dresden,
your son knew nothing of life
beyond the paternal dwelling and the
church of St. Thomas. He has been
received here as the son of an illustrious
artist; he has won a proud distinction
for himself. Can you wonder
that applause and flattery have
turned his head a little? He might
have got over that; but, as ill-luck
would have it, the Countess Von
Bruhl employed him as her music-master.
He fell in love with her."</p>

<p>"Is the boy mad?" exclaimed Bach,
rising from his chair.</p>

<p>"Friedemann's first thought afterward
was of his father. His union
with the girl he loved was impossible;
equally so his voluntary separation
from her society. Her uncle bade
her receive a rich and noble suitor.
Compelled to give up hope, the victim
of the wildest remorse and anguish,
Friedemann fled to dissipation
for relief. I strove in vain to help
him; but his grief was too new, too
fierce and consuming; I looked to
time only for the cure. In wild company
only could he find diversion
from maddening thoughts, and I feared
the worst if that resource were denied
him. Now he has taken a prudent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_814" id="Page_814">[814]</a></span>
step. He has broken off his
acquaintance with the countess."</p>

<p>"Heaven be praised!" cried the
father clasping his hands.</p>

<p>"But her uncle, the minister, had
discovered their intimacy. He has
sworn the destruction of your son. I
have been fortunate enough to baffle
him. But Friedemann must instantly
leave Dresden."</p>

<p>"He shall!" cried Sebastian. "My
poor son needs comfort; he can find
it only at home."</p>

<p>"Then he may come to you?"</p>

<p>"Could a father repel his unhappy
child? I know, alas! his fiery soul,
his need of sympathy. Bring him to
his loving father's arms."</p>

<p>Scherbitz caught the old man's hand
and warmly pressed it.</p>

<p>"Friedemann is saved!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>He left the room and the house,
promising soon to return. Sebastian
sat long in a mournful reverie. Then
seating himself at the piano, he played
a soft prelude, and sang a beautiful
melody by Paul Gerhard. The
music swelled into majestic harmony,
and many a passer-by in the street
stopped to listen, drinking in peace
and consolation from the heavenly
sounds.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Faustina Hasse, the most beautiful
woman in Dresden, and the
greatest dramatic singer not only of
her own, but perhaps of all times,
was reclining on a sofa in a luxuriously-furnished
room in her palace.
Flowers stood on a table beside her,
and several costly trifles were thrown
about; but she was simply dressed in
white muslin, with a necklace and
bracelets of pearls. Her little foot in
its satin slipper beat impatiently the
footstool on which it rested; there
was a tint of painful excitement on
her cheek; and a touch of melancholy
about her mouth softened the
pride that usually masked her lovely
features.</p>

<p>A waiting-maid had just presented
the card of a visitor on a silver
plate.</p>

<p>"I will see him," was the careless
answer.</p>

<p>The maid retired and ushered in
the Count von Bruhl, who made a
low and courtly obeisance. The signora
bent her head slightly, and motioned
the count to a seat.</p>

<p>"You are surprised at a visit so
late in the evening, signora?" the
minister asked gently, after an embarrassed
silence.</p>

<p>"I do not know its object," was
her calm reply.</p>

<p>"Easily explained," with a bland
smile. "I am known for a fond husband;
in a fortnight I shall give a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</i> for my wife's birthday. It will
surpass all other <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fêtes</i> in splendor, if
the Signora Hasse will favor it with
her presence. May I hope that she
will do so?"</p>

<p>"I do not sing, my lord minister."</p>

<p>"The signora has misunderstood
my humble petition. Even the elector,
whose admiration of the signora's
genius is well known, would not venture
to solicit such a favor."</p>

<p>"Will his highness be there?"</p>

<p>"He promised to honor me."</p>

<p>"I will come."</p>

<p>"Signora, my gratitude is unbounded!"
He raised her hand to his lips,
and retired with a low bow.</p>

<p>Faustina sprang to her feet, her
eyes flashing fire.</p>

<p>"Stop, monsieur!" she cried.</p>

<p>The minister stood still.</p>

<p>"Where is Friedemann Bach?" demanded
the lady.</p>

<p>The minister started visibly, but
suppressed all sign of emotion. With
a courtly smile he endeavored to
evade reply.</p>

<p>"Where is Friedemann Bach?"
still more angrily asked Faustina.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_815" id="Page_815">[815]</a></span></p>

<p>Something in her face warned the
count not to trifle with her.</p>

<p>"He is probably on his way to
Königstein," answered the premier.</p>

<p>"For what offence?" asked the
lady with a smile of scorn.</p>

<p>"Oh! he needs discipline. The
whole parish is disgusted at the scandalous
life led by their court-organist.
He edifies the devotional with his organ-playing
on Sunday morning; but
joins his fellow-rioters in the wildest
orgies at Seconda's, on Sunday
night."</p>

<p>"What have you done with his fellow-rioters?"</p>

<p>"They belong to high families,"
answered the count with a significant
shrug.</p>

<p>"And pass uncensured. Very fair,
my lord minister! But you are mistaken.
Bach is not on the road to
Königstein. He has just had an interview
with his highness, here, in my
house. I am known to have some
influence with the elector; and have
used it."</p>

<p>"What have you done, signora?"
exclaimed the minister, shocked into
a real expression of his feelings.</p>

<p>"Silence!" said Faustina haughtily.
"His highness knows all; knows
why you have persecuted the unhappy
youth, why you would bring misery
on the whole family&mdash;such a family!
Heartless courtier! What can
you know of the worth of such a
man? Friedemann leaves Dresden;
but you must provide him with another
place, and one worthy of his
genius. The elector wills it so."</p>

<p>She passed out of the room. The
count walked to the window, looked
out into the dark night, and drummed
on the pane in some embarrassment.
There was a storm in his breast, but
it was necessary to suppress all agitation.
Presently he turned around,
and saw Friedemann Bach and the
page, Von Scherbitz, standing in the
room. The minister walked toward
them, and said in a gentle tone,</p>

<p>"Monsieur Bach, I am concerned
that you must leave us; but it is necessary.
You will go as soon as possible
to Merseburg. The place of
organist in that cathedral is vacant,
and I have appointed you to it. I
wish you a pleasant journey."</p>

<p>And with a bow he retired.</p>

<p>"<i>Bravissimo, mon comte!</i>" cried
the page, laughing heartily. "Roscius
was a bungling actor to him.
Come now, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon ami</i>," turning to
Friedemann&mdash;"to your father. He
knows all."</p>

<p>Friedemann followed him out with
a look of despair. It was a clear,
starry winter night. As they came to
Bach's house, they heard the hymn
Sebastian was singing. As they entered
the room, he rose and bade his
son welcome.</p>

<p>"Can you forgive me, father?"
murmured Friedemann gloomily.</p>

<p>"I have forgiven you; for I trust
in your ability to amend."</p>

<p>"No word of reproach?"</p>

<p>"Your conscience does that; my
part is to comfort you. Come home
to Leipzig."</p>

<p>"No," said Friedemann resolutely;
"I will not go home till I am again
worthy to be received there."</p>

<p>"Are you so resolved?"</p>

<p>"My life henceforward shall show
that I am true to you, father. I will
strive to overcome the anguish and
remorse that have wrecked me. If
I succeed, all will be well. If I fail
in the struggle&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then come to my heart, Friedemann!"</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>The son threw himself into his father's
arms.</p>

<p>The next morning Sebastian and
Philip returned to Leipzig, while
Friedemann set out on his journey
to Merseburg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_816" id="Page_816">[816]</a></span></p>


<h3>PART SECOND.</h3>

<p>Madam Anna Bach, the wife of
Sebastian, was at home in Leipzig
with her daughters and her youngest
son, Christian, waiting for the father
to join them after he had dismissed
his pupils for the day. Thirteen years
had elapsed since the occurrences related.</p>

<p>Johann Sebastian Bach came in
presently. He was still a stately and
handsome man, bright-eyed, and steady
in his carriage; but the once
smooth forehead was furrowed with
care; his cheeks had fallen in, and
their livid hue betrayed internal disease.</p>

<p>He held out his hand to his wife,
as he placed himself in his arm-chair.</p>

<p>"You seem exhausted to-day," Madame
Bach remarked. "I am glad
the lessons are over."</p>

<p>Sebastian smiled.</p>

<p>"I have strength left," he said, "to
make good scholars; and so long as
I can work, none shall find me remiss.
You look so pleased; what
have you there?"</p>

<p>"A letter for you, from Philip."</p>

<p>"Ho! ho!" cried Sebastian joyfully;
"has the scapegrace at last
found time to write to his old father?
I have sometimes thought he has forgotten
how to write since he has been
concert-master in the service of his
Majesty of Prussia! Well, what says
he?" And he opened and read the
letter.</p>

<p>It was a dutiful but rather stiff
epistle from a young man unused to
literary composition. He described
life in Berlin, and the concerts given
at court two or three times a week,
with the private musical entertainments
the king had in his cabinet,
where Philip Emmanuel accompanied
on the piano his majesty's performance
on the flute. The king, he
wrote, played the flute surprisingly;
but was capricious as to time, following
the notes less than his own will
and pleasure.</p>

<p>"He always," the letter concluded,
"inquires after my esteemed father;
and often says, 'Will not your papa
come once more to Berlin?' I can
promise that if my dear and esteemed
father will visit us, he will be received
with joy and honors by all. Be pleased
to pardon my hasty writing; convey
my best love and duty to my
most honored mother, my beloved
brothers and sisters, and make me
happy with a speedy answer.</p>

<p>
"Your dutiful son,</p>

<p class="signature">"<span class="smcap">Philip Emmanuel Bach</span>."<br />
</p>

<p>As Sebastian refolded the letter, his
wife asked what he thought of another
visit to Berlin.</p>

<p>"It would do me good," said Sebastian.
"I would gladly see the
king once more. Twice in my life
have I believed there was something
good in me: the first time was in the
year 1717, when my contest was appointed
with M. Marchand, and he
took himself quietly off the evening before
it; the second time was three years
ago, when the great King of Prussia
came into the antechamber to welcome
me, and when some rude chamberlains
laughed at my expressions
of duty and homage, his majesty chid
them with, '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messieurs, voyez vous,
c'est le vieux Bach</i>.' That pleased
Friedemann so much!"</p>

<p>"Then you will go to Berlin?"</p>

<p>"If I can get leave of absence, and
if I find a small overplus of money in
the purse. Strange, that in my old
days I should be seized with a roving
propensity! I had nothing of it in
youth. Well, let us go in to dinner."</p>

<p>It was near the close of day,
and Sebastian sat outside the door of
his dwelling, surrounded by his family,
under the stately lindens that shaded
the avenue leading to the old
Thomas's school. The mother and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_817" id="Page_817">[817]</a></span>
her daughters were occupied in needlework
and knitting; the younger
sons were listening to their father's
anecdotes of the old organist, Reinecken,
his instructor in Hamburg.
The setting sun shone on a lovely
picture.</p>

<p>Caroline, who had her eyes turned
toward the corner of Cloister street
and Thomas's churchyard, suddenly
uttered a cry of joy, and sprang to
her feet.</p>

<p>The others rose and asked what
was the matter; the venerable father
alone kept his seat. A tall figure
was seen crossing the churchyard;
and now Sebastian rose, for he recognized
his son Friedemann.</p>

<p>"Father," cried Friedemann, "I
have come to stay with you!"</p>

<p>The father stretched out his arms
and warmly embraced his son. The
others crowded round him, bidding
him a joyous welcome. Nearly an
hour passed in the delightful confusion
of such a reunion.</p>

<p>Later in the evening, Sebastian was
alone with his son, and asked what
had brought him home so suddenly.</p>

<p>Friedemann had overmastered the
sorrow that had crushed his spirit
thirteen years before. But a thousand
difficulties were in his way, and
the struggle preyed on his mind. He
began to despair of ever doing any
thing truly great in art. He had
wished to strike out a new path; the
motive of his efforts was pure, and he
did not design to neglect the excellent
old school.</p>

<p>"But I have been slandered, insulted!"
he exclaimed bitterly. "My
aim has been ridiculed, my endeavors
have been maliciously criticised, my
merits decried."</p>

<p>"By whom, Friedemann?"</p>

<p>Friedemann colored as he answered,
"I know I am wrong to be disturbed
by the malignity of a shallow fool;
but I cannot help it. There is a critic
in Halle, one schoolmaster Kniffe,
who passes for a luminary in the musical
horizon, and writes reviews."</p>

<p>"I have seen them; they are absurd,"
said Sebastian. "He must
cause some sport in Halle."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, he is dreaded
on account of his malice; and his
base libels please the ill-natured and
envious."</p>

<p>"And know you not," asked his
father, "that only the base and evil
array themselves against the good?
Is there a more certain proof of elevated
worth than the impotent rage
and opposition of the vicious? I never
taught you to look with pride or
arrogance on your equals or inferiors;
but to be calm and self-possessed, and
to maintain your ground in reliance
on Him to whom alone you are accountable.
Do that, Friedemann, and
no stupid or malicious critic can make
you dissatisfied with yourself."</p>

<p>Here Caroline came in, announcing
that a stranger wished to speak
with her father.</p>

<p>"He would not," she said, "give
his name."</p>

<p>Sebastian bade her bring him in.
Presently a sharp voice called out,</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bon soir, mon cher</i> papa!" and
the stranger entered and took the old
man's hand. "Do you not know me?"</p>

<p>Friedemann recognized him, and saluted
Monsieur von Scherbitz.</p>

<p>"Ha! our ex-court-organist. The
same ill-boding frown between the
brows as in 1737! You are little
changed in thirteen years. And I, at
fifty-three, am grown to be a first
lieutenant."</p>

<p>"You proved a friend to my son
in his danger," said Sebastian, "and
are therefore welcome to me and
mine. To what lucky chance am I
indebted for this visit to my quiet
home?"</p>

<p>"To the most unlucky, my dear
sir! I was so careless, at the prime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_818" id="Page_818">[818]</a></span>
minister's last court, as to tread on
the left fore paw of his lady consort's
lapdog. The beast cried out; the
countess demanded satisfaction; and
in punishment for my misdeed I am
marched as first lieutenant to Poland
in the body-guard of his excellency."</p>

<p>Sebastian felt a horror creep over
him at the sarcastic, misanthropic wit
of his visitor, and sought to change
the conversation. But Scherbitz went
on jesting in his bitter way about his
tragical destiny, concluding with the
information that he had come over
to Leipzig simply to see Papa Bach
once more in his life; for, on the
word of a first lieutenant, he had loved
and honored him since the first time
he had seen him thirteen years ago.</p>

<p>The next morning Scherbitz walked
in the little garden behind Thomas's
school, bounded by its high
wall. He saw Caroline fastening a
vine to an <i>espalier</i>, and came to assist
her. In a conversation with her, he
learned that none of the daughters of
Bach had any talent for music. The
charming singing he had heard early
in the morning was by Madam Bach.
But Caroline had a poetic taste, and
was Friedemann's favorite sister.</p>

<p>In talking with Friedemann, his
friend could not fail to discover the
morbid state of his mind. Scherbitz
thought it came from thinking too
deeply.</p>

<p>"Not the will," he said, "but action
removes mountains. We are
but philosophers, and the slaves of
circumstances. Had not the minister
played the spy on you and his pretty
niece, had not I stepped on the lapdog's
foot, we might both have been
at this moment sitting quietly in
Dresden; you beside Natalie, witching
the world with music; I as a
merry page of fifty-three, jesting and
enduring."</p>

<p>"Do you know," said Friedemann,
and as he spoke his countenance altered
strangely, "I have often prayed
that I might be mad, for a time&mdash;not
for ever!" In a quick, vehement
tone, "Oh! no&mdash;no&mdash;not for ever;
but mad enough to forget. And yet,
the memory of what I have suffered
would even then cling to me!"</p>

<p>He pressed his hands with a wild
gesture over his eyes.</p>

<p>"You must not talk so wildly,"
said the lieutenant soothingly. "You
are yet young, and can accomplish
much."</p>

<p>"What can I do?" cried Friedemann
with harrowing laughter. "Nothing,
nothing! At eight and thirty
all is dead with me; I am older than
you! Ha! mark you not where
<em>madness</em> lurks yonder behind the
door, making ready to spring upon
my neck as I go out? He dares
not seize on me when my father is
near; he shrinks up till he is little,
and hides himself in a spider's web
over the window. But he shall not
get hold of me! Ha, ha, ha! I am
cunning. I will not leave the chamber
without my father. Look you,
old page, I understand a feint as well
as you!"</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon ami! mon ami!</i> what is the
matter?" cried the lieutenant, and,
seizing his friend by the shoulders, he
shook him violently. "Friedemann
Bach! do you not hear me?"</p>

<p>Friedemann stared at him vacantly.
At length his face lost its unnatural
expression; his eyes became like living
eyes, and he asked softly what
M. von Scherbitz wanted.</p>

<p>"What makes you such an idiot,
man? Recollect yourself!" cried
Scherbitz.</p>

<p>Friedemann gave a forced laugh.</p>

<p>"You take a jest deeply," he said.
"And you really believe that I am
sometimes mad? Not yet, friend!
I am more rational than ever."</p>

<p>"Well, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon ami</i>, it was your jest;
but one should not paint the devil on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_819" id="Page_819">[819]</a></span>
the wall. Sit down, and play me
something till I get over my fright.
You acted your part so naturally!"</p>

<p>Friedemann sat down to the instrument
and began to play.</p>

<p>"I did not dream of this," muttered
the lieutenant; while Friedemann,
after playing half an hour, suddenly
let his hands drop, sank back, and
fell fast asleep.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the morning of the 21st of July,
1750, the church-bells were ringing a
solemn yet cheerful peal, inviting the
pious to the house of God. The sun
shone brightly; the old man's heart
was renewed in love and devotion,
and even Friedemann's gloomy breast
was penetrated with the beam of
comfort, joy, and love. He had
spent a part of the night in studying
a masterpiece of his father's, the
great Passion music. Full of the grandeur
of the work, his face animated,
he was walking to and fro in his father's
chamber, pondering a similar
work which he thought of undertaking.</p>

<p>Sebastian sat in his arm-chair, with
folded arms, dressed ready for church.
He followed with his eyes, smiling affectionately,
the movements of his son.
After a while, he said,</p>

<p>"I am glad the Passion music
pleases you so well. I have a work
of quite another kind, finished, the
first idea of which I got from your
<i>Fughetten</i>. And you are the first,
after me, that shall see it."</p>

<p>He went to his desk, opened it,
took out a sealed packet, and gave it
to his son. It was inscribed, "To my
son Friedemann."</p>

<p>"I meant it for you, in case of my
death before I saw you," said the old
man. "You may break the seal."</p>

<p>Friedemann opened the packet. It
contained that nobly conceived, admirably
executed work which from
the day of its appearance has commanded
the reverent admiration of
all the initiated&mdash;<i>The Art of Fugues</i>,
by Johann Sebastian Bach.</p>

<p>Friedemann looked over the manuscript
with sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>"And <em>my</em> poor attempt," he cried,
"has suggested a work destined to
immortalize its author! I have not
lived in vain. O my father! thanks.
You have made me a noble present."</p>

<p>"You have rewarded me, Friedemann."</p>

<p>Sebastian went on to pour into his
son's heart the kindly words of wisdom.</p>

<p>"While you labor to deserve the
appreciation of your equals," he said,
"strive to instruct those who cannot
thus repay you. It is for man only
to show to the best that he belongs
to the best. Let your light shine&mdash;else
you lower yourself, and rebel
against your Master."</p>

<p>The chime of the bells, that had
ceased, now recommenced; and Madam
Bach came in with her daughters,
young Christian, and the lieutenant.
All were ready for church.
Madam Bach gave her husband his
prayer-book and a bunch of flowers;
Caroline brought his hat.</p>

<p>Sebastian rose, gave his arm to his
wife, and walked to the door. Turning
back an instant, he glanced at
the window shaded with vine-leaves
glistening in the sunlight, and said,</p>

<p>"What a lovely morning!"</p>

<p>As he went out of the room, he
stopped suddenly, and let fall the
flowers and the prayer-book. The
women screamed with fright. The
old man struggled for a few moments,
then sank back lifeless into the arms
of his son.</p>

<p>Thus died Johann Sebastian Bach,
by a stroke of apoplexy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Three years had passed. The wealthy
Baron von Globig celebrated the
feast of the vintage at his magnificent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_820" id="Page_820">[820]</a></span>
villa not far from Dresden. Gilded
gondolas, with long and many-colored
pennants, were gliding to and fro
over the bosom of the Elbe, landing
the distinguished guests. The profuse
splendor that marked all the preparations
was worthy of the favorite of
the Count von Bruhl. Nothing the
most fastidious taste could suggest
was wanting.</p>

<p>Few in the aristocratic company
seemed to notice the host; but his
lovely wife was the observed of all.
She was dignified and courteous, but
appeared to take little interest in any
thing.</p>

<p>As twilight came on, colored lamps
were lighted in the gardens, and gorgeous
illuminations were displayed.
Bands of musicians played alternately;
stately men and beautiful women
moved in the merry dance, and general
hilarity prevailed.</p>

<p>When the company returned to the
great drawing-room, the Prussian ambassador
presented to the lady of the
house a distinguished-looking man as
Philip Emmanuel, the second son of
the great Sebastian Bach.</p>

<p>The baroness colored, and gave a
furtive glance around her. After a
few words of conversation, she asked
Bach, in a careless tone, where was
his elder brother.</p>

<p>"We do not know," answered Philip
sadly. "None of us has seen
Friedemann since the day of our father's
death, when he suddenly quitted
Leipzig."</p>

<p>"Have you heard nothing of
him?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;except that he had
been at times before subject to fits
of melancholy, which threatened his
reason. We fear the worst."</p>

<p>The baroness turned away in silence.
The baron came up, and presented
a petition for a little piece of
music from the celebrated Monsieur
Bach.</p>

<p>"We are to have some variety,"
he added; "a bit of fun, by way of
enhancing the effect of your divine
playing. A poor, half-crazy musician
from the Prague choir, who plays
dances in the villages, will be permitted
to give us a tune in the antechamber.
The doors may be opened;
but he must not come into the
light, for his dress is shabby and disordered."</p>

<p>The music sounded from the ante-room.
A servant threw open the
doors, and in the imperfect light the
guests saw a meanly-dressed man sitting
at the piano, his back toward
them. They had expected a joke;
the baron having told many of them
what a surprise he had in store. But
when they heard the playing&mdash;the
wonderful, entrancing melody, now
towering into passion, now sinking to
a harmonious plaint, which the poor,
unknown musician drew from the instrument&mdash;all
were deeply touched.
The baroness and Philip stood, pale
as death, looking inquiringly yet
doubtingly upon each other. At a
bold turn in the music, the baroness
leaned toward him, whispering,</p>

<p>"'Tis he!" and Philip exclaimed
aloud,</p>

<p>"It is my brother&mdash;Friedemann!"</p>

<p>The musician turned, sprang up,
and rushed into Philip's arms. At
sight of the baroness, he started back
with the exclamation&mdash;"Natalie!"</p>

<p>The baroness sank back in a
swoon. Friedemann tore himself from
Philip's arms, forced his way through
the crowd, and rushed from the house.
The shock had brought on another
attack of his awful malady.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An old man, past three score and
ten, sat in a room in the upper story
of a house in one of the suburbs of
Berlin. He was reading a pile of
music that lay on the table, making
notes on the margin with a pencil.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_821" id="Page_821">[821]</a></span>
The room was poorly furnished, and
lighted by a single lamp that flared
in the currents of air, flinging fitful
shadows on the wall. The storm
raging without shook the loose panes
in the window, and twisted the weather-cocks
on the roof till they creaked
as they swung. The cold had
penetrated the chamber, and the fire
in the grate was scanty. It was the
last night of the year.</p>

<p>But all absorbed sat the old man,
and heeded not cold or tempest as
he read the music. His form was
tall and emaciated; his pale face
showed the ravages of age and disease.
His thin, white locks fell back
from his temples; but his large eyes
had the brightness of youthful enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The bell struck midnight. The
sounds of festal music, singing, and
shouting came from the streets; and
faintly on the wind came the swell
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te Deum</i> chanted in a neighboring
church.</p>

<p>The old man looked up from his
reading, and listened attentively.
There was a dreamy, far-away look in
his eyes.</p>

<p>The door opened, and a young
man, with a pale and melancholy
face, and a form more meagre than
the other's, came into the room.</p>

<p>"What hour struck?" asked the
old man.</p>

<p>"Midnight. You had better go to
bed."</p>

<p>"I do not need sleep. Look, I
have been reading this legacy of my
father. Ah! if you, poor Theodore,
could have had such a father. What
year has just begun?"</p>

<p>"Eighty-four."</p>

<p>"Eighty-four! Forty-seven years
ago.... We will not speak of
that."</p>

<p>"Poor old friend! Will you never
tell me who you are?"</p>

<p>"You did not ask me the day I
first saw you; when I found a madman
just about to take his own life.
I pulled away the weapon; I bade
you live!"</p>

<p>"You saved my life; but what is it
worth? You see me old even in
youth."</p>

<p>"You will live many years yet."</p>

<p>"No. I suffer a great deal; I feel
that my hours are numbered. But
why not tell me your name?"</p>

<p>"He who composed that noble
work," said the old man, pointing to
the music, "was my father."</p>

<p>"The name was on the first leaf,
with the title of the music, and you
have torn it out! I do not understand
music, you know. Tell me,
old friend, what to call you?"</p>

<p>"'The Old Musician.'"</p>

<p>"So the few who know you in this
great city always call you. But your
other name?"</p>

<p>"I have promised to reveal it only
to an artist in music."</p>

<p>Then, noticing the pallid and sunken
cheek of his young companion,
he said,</p>

<p>"Has the new year brought you
nothing, Theodore?"</p>

<p>Theodore took a roll of money
from his vest pocket, and threw it on
the table.</p>

<p>"Gold!" exclaimed the old man.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;when we need it no longer!"</p>

<p>He drew out a flask from the pocket
of his cloak.</p>

<p>"Wine, too; the best of Johannisberger!
You have tasted no wine
lately; drink to the new year."</p>

<p>The old man turned away; for bitter
recollections came up, associated
with the season.</p>

<p>Theodore took two glasses from
the buffet, drew up a chair, sat down,
and uncorked the flask. He filled
the old man's glass and his own with
the wine, which diffused a rich fragrance.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_822" id="Page_822">[822]</a></span></p>

<p>The old man asked, at length, how
he came by such luck.</p>

<p>"I sold my paintings to a lord travelling
through the city."</p>

<p>"What a pity you could not exhibit them!"</p>

<p>"Those sketches cost me seven
years of more than labor: all I have
thought, lived, suffered; the early
dreams of youth; the stern repose
after the struggle with fate! I sacrificed
all. I spared not even the glimmering
spark of life; and thought
when the work was finished the laurel
would deck my brow in death.
All fancies! Wherever I offered my
work, I was repulsed. The publishers
thought the undertaking too expensive.
Some advised me to paint
scenes from the Seven Years' War;
others called my sketches wild and
fantastic."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay!" murmured the old
man. "Lessing, who died three years
ago, said to me rightly, 'All the artist
accomplishes beyond the appreciation
of the multitude, brings him
neither profit nor honor! The highest
must grovel with the worm.'"</p>

<p>"As long as I can remember, old
friend, I have had but one passion&mdash;for
my art. Yet must I degrade art
to the rabble; must paint apish faces,
while visions of divine loveliness float
before me; must feel the genius within
me comprehended by none; must
be driven to despair of myself! With
all my gifts, I must ask myself, at
five and twenty, Wherefore have I
lived?"</p>

<p>"Live on; the answer will come."</p>

<p>"Has it come to you? Had I
gained the prize, I might have been
like Raphael; you, like some great
master of your art. Success was not
for us; and we are doomed to insignificance."</p>

<p>"Silence!" cried the old man; "that
leads to madness. I know the horror
of madness. They tell me I was
a long time so."</p>

<p>"No fear of that, old friend. We
are both too near a sure harbor.
Come, fill up your glass! Hark to
the music and shouting in the streets.
Here we sit, like the gods on the
summit of Olympus, sipping nectar,
and laughing at the fools below us.
Drink as I do. No more? Well,
yonder is your bed, and here is mine.
Good-night to you."</p>

<p>They retired to rest. The storm
ceased to beat on the window-panes;
but the bell-ringing and music continued
throughout the night.</p>

<p>The bright sunshine of morning
flooded the chamber. The old man
arose and went to the window. It
was a clear, cold morning; the air
was keen, the sky cloudless; the frost
had wrought delicate tracery on the
panes.</p>

<p>The old man threw his cloak over
his shoulders, and stood some time at
the window. Then he went to awaken
his young friend.</p>

<p>He touched the hand that lay outside
the bed-covering; it was cold
and stiff! Poor Theodore had fainted
in the struggle with destiny. Long
the prey of heart-disease, he had died
in the night.</p>

<p>The old man stood as if paralyzed,
gazing on the face of his dead friend.
His last stay was broken!</p>

<p>Sitting down by the body, he remained
motionless the whole day.
Late in the afternoon, the woman
who kept the house came in with a
message to Theodore, and found the
old man exhausted and shivering with
the cold. She led him into a warm
room, and gave him nourishment.</p>

<p>When Theodore was buried, the
gold he left was given to the old
man, with whom he had lived two
years, supplying the wants of both
by his scanty earnings as a portrait-painter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_823" id="Page_823">[823]</a></span>
and the sale of a drawing now
and then. Now that he had no resource
for the future, the people of
the house advised the old man to go
to the overseer of the poor-house. He
shook his head, saying, "No; I will
go to Hamburg."</p>

<p>"To Hamburg!" echoed the housekeeper.
"Hamburg is a long way
from Berlin; you could not bear such
a journey."</p>

<p>But the old man soon forgot his
purpose. He resumed his wanderings
through the streets of Berlin&mdash;his
practice before he met with Theodore&mdash;stopping
to listen whenever he
heard music. He would sometimes
go into the houses where concerts
were given; and all who remembered
him were glad to see "the Old Musician"
once more.</p>

<p>One evening as he walked about
the streets, he stopped to listen to
music sounding from the windows of
an illuminated palace. He went up
the steps and was going in; but the
porter, a Swiss, pushed him rudely
back. So he stood without in the
cold and cutting night wind, and listened,
his whole soul absorbed in the
music.</p>

<p>A servant in livery came out, and
ran against him. "Ha!" he exclaimed
in surprise; "is that you, Old
Musician? How long it is since I
have seen you. Why do you stand
there shaking in the cold?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur Swiss would not let me
pass," answered the old man.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Swiss is an idiot! Come
in with me, old friend; you shall thaw
your old limbs, and have some refreshment.
My lord gives a grand
concert." To the porter he said,
"You must always let in the Old Musician;
my lord has given orders that
it shall be so. He comes to enjoy
the music."</p>

<p>He led the old man to a seat near
the fire in one of the ante-rooms, and
drew a folding screen before him.
"You are out of view here," he said;
"but you can hear every thing. I
will bring you a glass of wine."</p>

<p>All that evening the old man listened
to music that thrilled his inmost
heart. It was late when the concert
ended. Then the man who had
brought him in, came and told him
it was time to go, offering to send a
boy home with him.</p>

<p>"That was admirable music," said
the old man drawing a deep breath.</p>

<p>"It was," replied the servant. "All
you heard was composed by the same
master, who is staying with my lord at
present."</p>

<p>"What is his name?"</p>

<p>"It is Master Naumann, chapel-master
to the Elector of Saxony."</p>

<p>"Let me speak with him, if he is
in the house."</p>

<p>"Certainly, if you want to ask any
thing."</p>

<p>"I want to thank him."</p>

<p>"Well, come to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>The next morning the strange visitor
was announced to the composer
Naumann.</p>

<p>"Who is the Old Musician?" he
asked. The man could not tell. He
had been known by that name for
years in Berlin, and was thought to
be partially insane at times. But he
was said to have a thorough knowledge
of music.</p>

<p>"Bring him in," said Naumann.
The old man entered the room. He
had a dignity of mien that inspired
respect, in spite of his poor apparel;
and Naumann rose and advanced to
meet him.</p>

<p>"You are welcome, my good friend,
though I know not your name&mdash;welcome
as a lover of our noble art.
Take this chair."</p>

<p>The old man, still standing, answered,
"I come to thank you, sir,
for the pleasure of hearing your concert
last evening. I was a listener,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_824" id="Page_824">[824]</a></span>
privately, and understood that your
latest compositions were performed.
I will not conceal my name from you.
I am Friedemann Bach."</p>

<p>Naumann stood petrified with astonishment.
"Friedemann Bach!"
at length he repeated; "the great
son of the great Sebastian. How
strange, indeed! I saw your brother
Philip at Hamburg, only last year.
The excellent old man mourns you
as dead."</p>

<p>"I would be dead to all who knew
me in better days," was the melancholy
reply. "It would grieve them
to know how sad a failure my life has
been. Even in Berlin none know
that Friedemann Bach yet lives; not
even Mendelssohn, the friend of Lessing.
While he lived, I had no fear
of starving."</p>

<p>Naumann was deeply affected. Philip
had told him his brother's history;
his sorrows, his disappointments, his
terrible suffering for years. "What
can I do for you?" he asked mournfully.</p>

<p>"Nothing," answered Bach. "You
have done every thing in showing
me what I could and should have
done. You know how I failed; how
my life was wasted; how I fell short
in all my bold and burning schemes.
I fainted, and did not reap. But you
need not the warning of my history.
You walk securely and cheerfully in
the right path. I can only thank you
for your magnificent works. The
blessing of God be with you! I feel
now that I have nothing more to do
in this world."</p>

<p>He turned away, and was gone before
Naumann could recover from the
emotion his words called forth. He
called the servant to ask where he
could be found; but no one could tell
him. The boy who had escorted the
old man home had not been suffered
to go to his door. At length he met
with Moses Mendelssohn, and told
him what had happened.</p>

<p>Mendelssohn was astonished to
learn that Friedemann Bach yet lived,
and in Berlin. The only clue he
had was his knowledge of Lessing's
old dwelling, where the old musician
lived some time before.</p>

<p>The next morning the two went
to the Friedrichstadt, and found Lessing's
house. The housekeeper opened
the door.</p>

<p>"Does M. Friedemann Bach live
here yet?" asked Mendelssohn.</p>

<p>The woman shook her head, lifting
the corner of her apron at the same
time to wipe her eyes.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," she cried; "but I
cannot help it! Just at this time yesterday
they carried away my poor
friend, the Old Musician. He died
three weeks after his young friend, the
painter."</p>

<p>Her voice was choked with tears.</p>

<p>There was no need of further inquiry.
Poor Bach was a wanderer
no more.</p>

<h2>BRITISH PREMIERS IN RELATION TO BRITISH CATHOLICS.</h2>

<p class="center">CONCLUDED.</p>


<p>Every step toward emancipation,
however halting and feeble, was of
great consequence, since it established
a precedent&mdash;and precedents in
England have often the force of law.
Thus, the act fifth, George IV., chapter
seventy-nine, permitted persons to
hold office in the receipt of customs,
without taking any oath but that of
allegiance. This was a gain, trivial
in itself, yet, under the circumstances,
not to be despised. The same thing
was true of Mr. George Bankes's bill,
relieving English Catholics from penalty
of double assessment of land-tax.
It was introduced and passed in 1828.
While recording Canning's services
to the cause which Catholics had at
heart, we must not forget to show
how ready he was, on the other hand,
to combine with his colleagues when
Ireland had to be oppressed and persecuted.
In 1825, they agreed, with one
mind, to put down the Irish Catholic Association,
because they saw how powerful
an instrument it would become, in
O'Connell's hands, for the attainment
of freedom. The bill by which they
suppressed it was called, by the Liberator,
"the Algerine Bill." But in
the same year an attempt was made,
with very doubtful sincerity, to modify
the maddening effect of this suppression
by conferences with O'Connell,
Sheil, and other lay Catholics of
influence, by inducing them to assent
to a proposal, made by way of compensation,
for the pensioning of the
Catholic clergy, and the disfranchisement
of the forty-shilling freeholders.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
These were to be "the two wings" of
a Catholic relief bill, and to this offer
O'Connell was induced to adhere.
The measure was introduced by Sir
Francis Burdett, in April, 1825. It
passed the Commons by a considerable
majority; and was then, as might
have been expected, thrown out by
the Lords, who were fortified in their
opposition by the Duke of York.
Thus the great work of emancipation
was again postponed. Though there
had been points in Canning's conduct
which were displeasing to Catholics;
though, with strange inconsistency,
he resisted the repeal of the test and
corporation acts, which by relieving
dissenters would have relieved Catholics
also; though he was sharply attacked
by Brougham, and charged
with pleading their cause without the
smallest idea of success, and with betraying
those whom he appeared to
befriend, yet they listened with delight
to his speech in behalf of their
claims a few months before his death.
They placed their confidence in him,
and looked forward to his premiership
as the season of their deliverance.
But as Pitt had resigned office in consequence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_827" id="Page_827">[827]</a></span>
of his attachment to the
Catholic cause, so it was Canning's
fate also to taste the bitter fruits of
befriending an oppressed and hated
communion. The frowns of royalty,
the fury of Tories, and the perfidy of
Whigs, combined with the insidious
growth of disease to bring him down
to the grave harassed and worn.</p>

<p>A <i>recess government</i> followed.
Lord Goderich had been a supporter
of the Catholic claims; but mediocrity
such as his could not be expected
to hold its place long at the head of
affairs, and still less to conduct a
momentous and vital question to a
happy issue. That question, like all
others of equal magnitude, had to be
settled out of parliament before it
could be carried within its walls.
The monster meetings assembled in
Ireland at the call of O'Connell
brought the matter to a crisis, and
convinced all reasonable men that
concession could not long be delayed.
Yet the Duke of Wellington, who
succeeded Lord Goderich in 1828,
and Sir Robert Peel still ranged themselves
on the side of the opponents
of emancipation. The Lords, in the
month of June, rejected a motion
pledging them to a favorable consideration
of the measure. Vesey Fitzgerald,
however, an Irish liberal, was
made president of the Board of Trade,
and required, according to English
law, to be reelected as member of parliament
before he could hold his office
in the government. It was a
glorious opportunity for the Irish, and
they embraced it manfully. At the suggestion
of Sir David Roos, an Orangeman,<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
and of an intimate friend named
Fitzpatrick, O'Connell proposed
himself as a candidate for Clare, in opposition
to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</i> of the government,
Mr. Vesey Fitzgerald. In such
a conflict the odds were all but desperate;
yet O'Connell was victorious,
although <em>legally</em> ineligible. He
was declared duly returned; and he
was the first Catholic elected by an
Irish constituency since the reign of
James II.</p>

<p>That election was, in effect, the triumph
of emancipation. It sunk deep
into the minds of the chiefs of the opposition.
The greatest statesmen had
long been wavering in secret. Lord
Liverpool had been convinced some
time before his death that the time
for yielding the point was drawing
nigh, and that he would soon have to
support the Catholic claims, if not as
a premier, at least as a peer. Sir Robert
Peel had, in 1825, requested
Lord Liverpool to relieve him of office
on the ground that emancipation
could no longer be deferred. Three
years later, he announced to the Duke
of Wellington his resolution to support
the claims he had so long resisted,
and declared that, in pursuit of
that "great object," he was ready to
sacrifice "consistency and friendship."
Little did the majority, either of his
friends or foes, imagine how deep a
change his mind had really undergone.</p>

<p>It would hardly be too much to
say the same of the duke. He was
the only man in England who could
carry emancipation, and the only
man who did do it. He was that
power in the state which the circumstance
required. He accomplished
in England, though with far different
aims and feelings, what the lyre of
Thomas Moore effected in Irish
homes, and the eloquence of O'Connell
on the fields of Tara and Clontarf.
The test and corporation act
being repealed, his way was cleared.
Persons holding office under the
crown were no longer obliged to
qualify themselves by receiving the
Lord's Supper in the Established
Church. He began, therefore, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_828" id="Page_828">[828]</a></span>
speaking on the Catholic claims with
studied ambiguity. Though he declared
that his opinions on this subject
were as decided as those of any one
in the house, he added that he should
oppose emancipation until he should
see a great change in the question.
That change was fast coming over it.
He knew that the Commons would
then pass no very arbitrary laws; that
they would not require candidates for
a seat in parliament to take the oaths of
allegiance and supremacy on the hustings;
that without emancipation it
would be impossible to disfranchise the
forty-shilling freeholders; that others
would be elected besides O'Connell;
and that they could not be prevented
from taking their seats and
representing their constituents without
a civil war. The duke, though a
great general, was not a man of blood.
He was not an impracticable man,
though a Tory. He knew how to
"take occasion by the hand," and to
do that of which St. Philip Neri says
there is not a finer thing on earth&mdash;make
a virtue of necessity. He was
influenced in the matter by no abstract
principle of justice, no enthusiasm
in favor of the oppressed, no
sympathy with a proscribed faith; but
he sincerely loved his country, and he
came by degrees to feel convinced
that her interests were consulted best
by altering the basis of her constitution
in church and state. He sought,
indeed, securities from those whom he
proposed to relieve, and he purchased
at their hands the disfranchisement
of the forty-shilling freeholders
in Ireland; but, on the other hand,
he was willing to endow the Catholic
Church in the sister isle, and to apply
three hundred thousand pounds per
annum toward the payment of the
priests. To this part of his plan Peel
could not be induced to consent,
and it was subsequently abandoned.
Great as Wellington was in war, he
was greater in peace&mdash;greater in his
victory over Protestant prejudices, and
as the champion of the rights of an injured
people and a persecuted creed.</p>

<p>On the 5th of March, 1829, Sir
Robert Peel (then Mr. Peel) brought
forward a bill for the relief of Catholics.
It was <em>the</em> bill long desired,
clamored for, dreaded; which was to
alter fundamentally the character of
English law, and change the destinies
both of England and Ireland. It
was preceded by a bill finally suppressing
the Catholic Association, at
the very time when that association
was being dissolved of its own accord.
The mind of Peel had been
long and anxiously engaged in the
study of the question as regarded Ireland.
Night and day he had been
examining evidence, pondering the
difficulties to be overcome, and the
chances of success. It was the nature
of his mind to work in secret,
and to manifest the result only when
it became absolutely necessary. During
the period of transition he voted
against Catholic emancipation, but did
so with manifest repugnance. Whatever
decision the house might come
to, he said, he should give it his
best acquiescence; and if the measure
should be carried, he should
use his earnest endeavors to reconcile
Protestants to it. When it was proposed
to admit Catholic lords into
the upper house, he offered but slight
opposition to the bill, nor did he
object to granting English Catholics
the same electoral rights as were enjoyed
by their brethren in Ireland.
His Tory friends were offended by
his moderation; for they loved "the
falsehood of extremes," and they
could not comprehend his anxiety to
promote education among the Catholic
as well as among the Protestant
part of the population. They
would not recollect how many indications
he had given of a possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_829" id="Page_829">[829]</a></span>
change in his future conduct in reference
to emancipation. They knew
not, or they affected to forget, that
two years before Canning died, he
had expressed to Lord Liverpool his
conviction that emancipation must
pass, and had offered to resign. So
long ago as 1821, he had declared, in
reply to Plunket, that even if his own
views prevailed, "their prevalence
must be mingled with regret at the
disappointment which he knew the
success of such opinions must entail
upon a great portion of his fellow-subjects."
He should, he said, "cordially
rejoice if his predictions proved
unfounded, and his arguments
groundless."</p>

<p>There were those who perceived
the current his thoughts were taking,
and among them was the Duke of Clarence,
afterward William IV. One
of the duke's sons told Cardinal Acton
that, when he returned home one
night from a very late division in the
House of Commons, of which he was
a member, he went to his father's
dressing-room, and was asked by the
duke how the division on emancipation
had gone; and when he was
told that the bill had been lost, the
duke said,</p>

<p>"That rascal, Peel, will adopt
emancipation, will carry it, and take
the glory from us who have fought
for it all our lives."<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>No less remarkable were the words
used by the Duke of Clarence when,
at last, Wellington and Peel introduced,
with all the weight of government
recommendation, the great bill for
Catholic relief. He wished, he said,
that the ministers had been as united
in 1825 as they proved in 1829. "It
will be forty-six years next month,"
he added, "since I first sat in this
house; and I have never given a vote
of which, thank God! I have been
ashamed; and never one with so
much pleasure as the vote I shall give
in favor of Catholic emancipation."</p>

<p>It would be foreign to our purpose
in this place to relate the circumstances
attending the passing of the bill,
and the admission of O'Connell into
the House of Commons. We are
concerned, not so much with these
events, as with the premiers who
brought them about. Peel did not
acquire the confidence of the Irish
whom he had emancipated. O'Connell
regarded him with implacable
aversion, and nothing could exceed
the hatred and distrust with which he
was treated by the Tories who had
once been his friends. It was nothing
to them that the change of his
politics had been the result of long
and arduous study; that he had taken
nothing for granted, but required
proof of every statement made by
those who sought to convert him to
their side. They had not seen what
we possess&mdash;the posthumous volumes
edited by Peel's trustees, Lord Stanhope
and Mr. Cardwell&mdash;and they
could not, therefore, judge of the laborious
and conscientious search by
which he arrived at his conclusions;
and even if they had seen them, it is
probable that they would have reproached
him for investigating the
subject in a hesitating frame of mind,
and for beating out for himself and
many of his followers a path of apostasy.</p>

<p>Eighteen years passed by before any
other measure of importance affecting
Catholic interests was laid before the
houses of parliament. The influence of
emancipation in a liberal direction was
felt deeply in the passing of the Reform
Bill of 1832, which but for that previous
act of justice would have been
impossible. The Duke of Wellington
prepared the way for Lord Grey, just
as Grey and his colleagues, by shaking
the power of the aristocracy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_830" id="Page_830">[830]</a></span>
destroying the rotten boroughs, led
in the issue to the more extended
reform bill carried by the late Lord
Derby, to the extension of the suffrage
to all householders and a large proportion
of lodgers, and to the passage
of the Irish Church bill. During the
premierships of Lord Melbourne and
of Sir Robert Peel the questions of
free-trade and the abolition of the corn-laws
absorbed public attention, and the
Catholic topic was all but set aside.
The paltry grant to Maynooth was
made a yearly subject of hot debate,
and a few thousands per annum were
grudgingly bestowed on an Irish college
for the education of priests, while
the Protestant establishment in that island
continued to be the most richly
endowed in the world in proportion
to the number of its members. The
public mind, however, was attracted
and agitated by a spectacle in which
parliament was not concerned, and
which in all the course of legislation
in favor of Catholics had never been
contemplated. This was the extraordinary
progress of Catholic ideas,
doctrines, and practices in the University
of Oxford, and among the
clergy of the establishment. The
excitement which this produced had
reached its height when, in February,
1847, a bill intended to supplement
the emancipation of 1829 was introduced
by Mr. Watson, Lord John
Manners, and Mr. Escott. At that
time Lord John Russell was premier,
with Grey, Palmerston, Macaulay,
and Granville among his colleagues.
They were little inclined to favor
Catholicity, though in matters of
politics they usually adopted a liberal
line; and, considering that in 1829
there had been 2521 petitions presented
to the Lords against emancipation,
and only 1014 in support of it&mdash;2013
to the Commons against it,
and only 955 in its favor&mdash;considering
that of 238 newspapers in the
United Kingdom in 1829, though 107
had been in its favor, 87 had been
against it and 4 neutral&mdash;it was not
surprising that the relief bill of Lord
John Manners did not find as many
strong supporters as it deserved. The
country was alarmed at the spread of
"popery," and the bill in question
seemed designed to quicken its pace
and widen its conquests. It would,
if it had been carried, have removed
some remaining disabilities; but the
loss of the bill did not in reality affect
in any very great degree the freedom
of Catholics or the progress of their religion.
The premier, Lord John Russell,
in the same year&mdash;1847&mdash;when
discussing the question of national
education, stated that, if a desire were
entertained to have schools for Catholics,
and for such only, he would
be in favor of it; but he reminded
his hearers that "of all the half-million
which had been already spent
under the direction of the treasury,
and in accordance with the minutes
of the council on education, not one
shilling was given in aid of the Roman
Catholic schools;" and in the
issue Catholic children were excluded
from all participation in the grant
of £100,000 a year which formed
part of the government scheme of
education brought forward by the
prime minister. This is enough to
prove how lukewarm Lord John Russell
was in his wish to promote education
among Catholics; and it is
enough, also, to lessen our surprise at
that monstrous display of intolerance
and bad statesmanship with which he
signalized his ministry in 1851.</p>

<p>It was two months after the close
of the session in 1850, that a papal
rescript establishing a regular hierarchy
in England, and parcelling out
the country into dioceses, was published
by the Cardinal Archbishop of
Westminster, and produced a commotion
altogether disproportioned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_831" id="Page_831">[831]</a></span>
the cause. The document was simple
and ordinary in its character, and
if issued in reference to any other
country but England, would probably
have attracted no attention, and certainly
have excited no surprise, terror,
indignation, and wrath. Among the
English it was received like the news
of a French invasion. It was denounced
as a "papal aggression,"
and the prime minister, instead of
allaying the storm, which he might
easily have done, lashed the waves
to fury by his letter to the Bishop of
Durham. He affected to be taken
by surprise, whereas the holy father
had himself shown the brief to Lord
Minto, Lord John Russell's father-in-law,
who had been residing in Rome
in a diplomatic capacity. Lord Minto
had raised no objection to the publication
of the document, nor offered
any suggestion as to the mode of
procedure. It was Cardinal Wiseman,
therefore, and the Catholics of
England and Ireland, who were taken
by surprise when the premier, who
had spent his life in promoting "civil
and religious liberty," suddenly effaced
the inscription from his banner,
and stood forward as the most prominent
assailant of Catholics in the
kingdom. It was the more inconsistent
and absurd in him to act thus,
because the right of the Catholic bishops
to designate themselves by the
titles of their sees was recognized by
common usage, by the servants of the
government, and in one act, at least,
of parliament. Lord John's inflammatory
letter to the Bishop of Durham
was followed by a speech from
the throne, couched in very high-flown
and pompous language about
the necessity of maintaining unimpaired
the "religious liberty" which
no one had sought to invade except
the premier and his friends.</p>

<p>The queen's speech was followed
in due time by a bill for preventing
the "assumption of any title, not
only from any diocese now existing,
but from any territory or place in any
part of the United Kingdom, and to
restrain parties from obtaining by virtue
of such titles any control over
trust property." Never was a more
foolish measure carried through parliament;
firstly, because it made not
the smallest change in the existing
state of things&mdash;it did not prevent a
single bishop from using on proper
occasion the title of his see, as conferred
on him by papal authority;
secondly, it was not even intended to
be carried into effect. Lord John
Russell and his colleagues never
dreamed of summoning bishop after
bishop into court, and compelling
them to pay the fine of £100 each,
or go to prison. Such a proceeding
would have enlisted popular feeling
immediately on their side. All the
wisest heads in parliament&mdash;men like
Lord Aberdeen, Sir James Graham,
and Mr. Gladstone&mdash;warned the premier
of the folly he was committing
in pandering to the wishes of an illiberal
and panic-stricken multitude.</p>

<p>The opposition offered to the measure
by Lord Aberdeen and Mr.
Gladstone is all the more to our purpose
because both these statesmen
became at a late period prime ministers.
Lord Aberdeen was one of those
whose minds had undergone a great
change on many important subjects,
and there can be no doubt that he
had yielded his to the plastic influence
of Sir Robert Peel. Having taken
part in the ministry of the Duke
of Wellington, he had, in 1829, contributed
to the success of the emancipation
bill; and when Peel was driven
from office, after abolishing the corn-laws,
by the resentment of the protectionists,
he had followed his master
into retirement, and declined a
place in the cabinet which was offered
to him by Lord John Russell. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_832" id="Page_832">[832]</a></span>
was not likely, therefore, that he would
in 1851 betray the principles which
he held sacred, and aid in swelling
an insensate cry. He saw clearly
that the ecclesiastical titles bill had
the double defect of being persecutive
if carried into operation, and
contemptible if passed only to lie
dormant. He accordingly resisted it
with all the more dignity because he
knew that resistance was, for the time
being, fruitless.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone has not been consistent
in his politico-religious career.
In 1838, he appeared in print as the
resolute champion of "church and
state," recommending the exclusion
of all persons not of the Established
Church from participation in the advantage
of subsidies granted for religious
purposes. In 1839 and 1840,
he opposed the admission of Jews
into parliament, and the assistance
afforded by the state to dissenters for
the education of their children. He upheld
that unjust establishment in Ireland
which he has since overthrown;
and in 1845 he resigned his place
in the cabinet in order that he might
be perfectly free to vote as he pleased
on the grants to Maynooth and
the endowment of Peel's colleges in
Ireland. When out of office, he supported
both these measures, and rendered
himself very obnoxious to many
of his supporters at Oxford by the
growing affection he manifested for
liberal measures. The year 1847 saw
him pleading for diplomatic relations
with Rome, and complaining that the
government had not communicated
with the holy see before establishing
the queen's colleges in Ireland. In
accordance with these generous and
enlightened views, Mr. Gladstone saw
with disgust the intemperate conduct
of the premier and the parliament in
the case of the ecclesiastical titles
bill. He contended that the influence
of the Protestant church in England
could never be maintained and
extended by temporal enactments;
that the papal rescript for assigning
sees and titles to Roman Catholic bishops
did not interfere in any way with
the political rights of Englishmen;
and ought not to be made the occasion
of a hostile, oppressive, and
impotent act of parliament.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We, the opponents of the bill," he said,
"are a minority, insignificant in point of
numbers. We are more insignificant, because
we have no ordinary bond of union.
What is it that binds us together against
you but the conviction that we have on our
side the principle of justice&mdash;the conviction
that we shall soon have on our side the
course of public opinion?"</p></blockquote>

<p>Events have proved how completely
his words were true. The ecclesiastical
titles bill is now regarded with
scorn, and treated with ridicule. Earl
Russell has confessed his mistake,
and Catholics, whom it was intended
to humiliate, are quite indifferent to a
prohibitory measure which was never
meant to be enforced. The reform
bill carried through both houses by
Disraeli and Lord Derby made the
disestablishment of the Irish Church
possible; the nation, freely represented,
pronounced in its favor; and the
measure was passed. A sense of justice,
if not a feeling of repentance,
has come over the public mind; and
a brief space of time has sufficed to
dispel prejudices that were the growth
of ages. Mr. Gladstone, as leader of
the liberal party, has been chiefly instrumental
in producing this change;
but it would be unfair not to specify
Mr. Bright as another most powerful
agent in bringing about the result.
So long ago as 1852, the former gentleman
declared his opinion that if
Mr. Spooner's annual motion against
the Maynooth grant should ever succeed,
and "the endowment were withdrawn,
the parliament which withdrew
it must be prepared to enter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_833" id="Page_833">[833]</a></span>
upon the whole subject of the reconstruction
of the ecclesiastical arrangements
in Ireland." These words
were considered remarkable at the
time, and appear even more so
when viewed by the light of recent
events. They plainly foreshadowed
that sweeping measure which we have
recently seen him triumphantly carry.
They pointed to a radical alteration in
the existing unfair and anomalous relations
between the church of the
many and the church of the few in the
sister isle. They left it, indeed, undecided
whether "levelling up" or
"levelling down" should be tried;
whether the several churches, Roman,
Anglican, and Presbyterian, should be
all reduced to the voluntary systems,
as in the United States, or whether
the Roman Catholic clergy should be
raised by the state to equal privileges
and emoluments with those enjoyed
by the Protestant pastors.</p>

<p>In the year 1868, it became manifest
that the conservative and the liberal
parties alike were agreed as to
the necessity of doing something with
the Irish Church. It also became apparent
that the leading men in each
party favored respectively the two
plans just alluded to&mdash;the "levelling
up" and the "levelling down" process.
Lord Derby, with his son Lord
Stanley, Mr. Disraeli, and other conservatives,
were inclined to make the
Catholic clergy in Ireland stipendiaries
of the state; but they did not
boldly and honestly propose any such
measure for the consideration of parliament.
The difficulties which faced
them were greater than they could
hope to overcome. The Catholic bishops
of Ireland had distinctly refused
to close with any offer of stipend
for the priests. They asked for
impartial legislation, but not for pay.
This difficulty amounted almost to an
impossibility; for of what avail was
it to vote emoluments to those who
would not accept them? But there
was another obstacle of almost equal
magnitude, which consisted in the
unwillingness of the English people
to endow "popery" in any shape.
One half of the electors under the
new reform bill were persons not in
communion with the Church of England;
and these, together with many
Anglicans, approved the voluntary
system in preference to national state
churches of any kind. Lord Mayo,
therefore, the Secretary of State for
Ireland, was studiedly ambiguous in
setting forth the intentions of the government
in regard to Irish ecclesiastical
matters. They were willing to
establish and endow a Catholic university
in Dublin, and to do something
(no one could discover exactly
what) in the way of "levelling up."
Mr. Gladstone instantly exposed the
absurdity of these crude and vague
intimations. He declared in the most
emphatic manner that the Irish Church
must cease to exist as an establishment,
and it soon became apparent
that the liberal party were determined
to aid him to the utmost in accomplishing
his design. It was an
extraordinary climax. The most popular
man in the kingdom&mdash;a Protestant
representing a Protestant constituency,
and the premier-to-be of a
Protestant queen and a Protestant
cabinet&mdash;was willing and eager, in the
name of the people, to disestablish
and disendow that church in Ireland
which had for three centuries been
the pledge of Protestant ascendency
and the main support of English and
Protestant landlordism in that island.</p>

<p>His foremost opponents were the
late Lord Derby and Disraeli, each of
them prime ministers at different periods.
Their opposition was the less
formidable because they were both men
of mixed politics. Lord Derby had
been by turns the friend and the foe of
Catholic liberty and equality. He defended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_834" id="Page_834">[834]</a></span>
the Irish establishment against
Joseph Hume in 1824; but he supported,
under the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i> of Earl Grey,
the cause of emancipation in 1832.
He aided in relieving the Irish Catholics
from the payment of tithes, and
he helped to strike off the chains of
the negro by presenting a bill for their
liberation; but, on the other hand, he
resisted with all his might the appropriation
clause in an Irish Church
bill of 1834, and even quitted office
because he would not give it his
countenance. To sequestrate any
part of the property of the Irish establishment
and apply it to secular
purposes was, in his eyes, to commit
a sacrilege and to violate a common
right. To this feeling he continued to
adhere, and to the last opposed the
Irish Church bill intended to disestablish
and disendow the Protestant
Church in Ireland. He intimated,
however, to the peers who were of his
party, that he did not think it their
absolute duty to oppose the bill as he
had done. For the sake of consistency
he voted against it, while not
a few of them did otherwise, seeing
how many evils might arise from
their resistance to the will of the
Commons and the majority of the
electors. Yet it was he and Mr.
Disraeli who made the passing of
this bill possible and inevitable. It
was the reform bill which they introduced,
and which extended the suffrage
to all householders and many
lodgers, that made the liberal party
stronger, and the abolition of the
Irish establishment necessary. It is
strange, indeed, that Lord Derby,
who offered so dogged a resistance
to free-trade and the abolition of the
corn-laws, who, with Lord George
Bentinck and Mr. Disraeli, headed the
forces of the protectionists, should
have been the means of developing
the democratic element in the British
constitution to a degree previously
unknown and unsought, even by the
liberals. It is strange, passing strange,
that he should thus have brought
about indirectly the measures he most
wished to avert; and the fact of his
having so acted is sufficient to stamp
him as a second-rate statesman, and
hardly worthy of a philosopher's name.</p>

<p>It would, we believe, be scarcely
unjust to apply the same remark to
Disraeli, notwithstanding his literary
fame. He is too crotchety ever to
be the great leader of a great party.
What Willis said of him was true: "In
a great crisis, with the nation in a
tempest, Disraeli would flash across
the darkness very finely; but he will
never do for the calm right hand of a
premier." His literary reputation preceded
his political celebrity, and will
outlast it. His mixed politics&mdash;his
dubious radical-toryism or tory-radicalism&mdash;like
the <i>plus</i> and <i>minus</i> in an
equation, cancelled each other, neutralized
his influence, and confounded
his arguments by mutual disagreement.
He discarded triennial parliaments
and vote by ballot, defected
to the Tories after coquetting with the
radicals, and thus laid himself open
to O'Connell's keenest abuse. "His
life," the Liberator said, "was a living
lie. There were miscreants among
the chosen people of God, and it must
certainly have been from one of these
that Disraeli descended. He possesses
just the qualities of the impenitent
thief who died upon the cross, whose
name, I verily believe, must have
been Disraeli." Certain it is, that
even the friends and admirers of Mr.
Disraeli repose in him little confidence.
They never feel sure as to
what he really is, or what he may
become. He is an enigma and a
sphinx. He has often embraced
principles to make himself a name,
and he has often sustained them in
spite of unpopularity. "It is quite a
mistake," he said on one occasion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_835" id="Page_835">[835]</a></span>
"to suppose I ever hated Peel. On
the contrary, he is the only man under
whom I should like to have
served. But I saw very clearly he
was the only man it would 'make'
me to attack, and I attacked him."
Here is a key to Disraeli's character.
The only premier he would like to
have served under was one whose
ruling principle was expediency; yet
even this premier he was willing to
oppose in order to rise in the political
and social scale. So he, at the head
of "Young England," denounced
free trade in corn, and applied the
system of protection to the state religion.
He was, like Lord Derby, intensely
opposed to the disestablishment
and disendowment of the Protestant
Church in Ireland; but he
was willing to endow Catholicity in
Ireland to a certain extent, and thus
make the state to be, like himself, an
assemblage of contradictions&mdash;a builder
up at the same moment of Babylon
and of Zion.</p>

<p>All roads, it is said, lead to Rome;
and in like manner it may be affirmed
that all English prime ministers
since the revolution have led Rome-ward
more or less. All have been
employed in raising the valleys and
levelling the hills, that a straight path
might be made for the majestic march
of the restored and ancient faith.
Every thing has told in favor of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gens lucifuga</i>, the despised and persecuted
Catholics, who shunned the
light of day. If one and the other
premier sought to oppress them anew,
as Walpole did in his day, and Lord
John Russell in our own, the unrighteous
attempt recoiled sooner or
later on its promoters, and ample reparation
was made in the long run
by a sense of justice being awakened
in the popular mind.</p>

<p>The prime ministers of England,
be it remembered, have been in some
sense its kings&mdash;nay, more than kings.
The real king has often been a cipher;
the queen&mdash;as for example,
Queen Caroline&mdash;has been above her
lord; and the premier&mdash;as, for instance,
Sir Robert Walpole&mdash;has controlled
them both. And if this was
the case in the last century, much
more is it so now. England is in
fact a republic, though nominally a
monarchy. It is an aristocratic republic;
and the prime minister being
responsible to parliament, and representing
for the time being the voice
of parliament and the popular will in
the council chamber of the sovereign,
is himself the chief executive in the
government, and holds in his hands
more real power than any one besides
in the kingdom. The monarch before
whom he bows, and to whom he
seems to defer, is in reality a puppet
of which he works the wires. King
George IV. was as nothing compared
to King Wellington, and King William
IV. was but a <i>middy</i> under the
command of Earl Grey. Queen Victoria
at the present moment (and we
say it with sincere respect for that excellent
and sovereign lady) is but a
shadow to the substance Gladstone,
and will be but a shadow to any
prime minister who may succeed him.
It was not so entirely with her grandfather.
He was really a king. He
ruled himself, and often very unwisely;
but times have changed. Political
and religious emancipation has
conferred on Catholics an importance
in the state which is altogether new,
and conversions on a large scale during
a quarter of a century have been
a concurrent cause of their occupying
a high and honorable position in society.
No prime minister, therefore,
can now ignore them, much less can
he molest them. In every session
of parliament some obloquy cast on
them in former ages is removed. The
lord chancellor of Ireland is now a Catholic,
and very soon the lord lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_836" id="Page_836">[836]</a></span>
of Ireland may be so too. Every
office of state, even the highest, will
in all probability be in a short time
opened to the Catholics, and the unjust
law which excludes them from
the crown, and prohibits members of
the royal family from marrying them,
will be swept away. If a Catholic
were to be made premier now, it
would not be more surprising than it
was that Wellington should emancipate
Catholics in 1829 or that Gladstone
should demolish the Irish establishment
in 1869. Providence has
wrought wonderfully in behalf of the
church already in England, and what
has been done should be taken by us
as a pledge of what is yet to be.
Meanwhile, it will be well to remember
gratefully, where gratitude is due,
the labors of Protestant prime ministers
for the removal of Catholic disabilities;
and in order to do so adequately,
we must make every allowance
for the prejudices in which they
were brought up, and the obstacles
which lay so thickly in their path.
We must not deny them all merit because
they have yielded to the force
of circumstances, but believe that
they probably would not thus have
yielded if there had not been in them
some noble and virtuous impulse,
some personal attachment to truth
and justice. The stronger their original
repugnance to concession, the more
deeply they felt convinced in earlier
years of the importance of maintaining
intact the Protestant constitution
in church and state, the more credit
assuredly is due to them for having
broken the spell of their youth, admitted
that their ideas were erroneous,
and faced a thousand reproaches
and unmeasured obloquy in their determination
to place the liberties of
their fellow-subjects on a broader and
better basis. The day has arrived
in England when the Protestant premier
and the Catholic primate shake
hands, not merely as private friends,
but also as representative men; and
when they were seen not long ago in
familiar intercourse at the foot of
the steps of the throne in the House
of Lords, they were for the moment
living signs and symbols of that vast
and happy change which has come
over the relations between the English
government and its Catholic subjects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fernan.</span> The older the better.
Stories are like wine, age improves
their flavor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uncle R.</span> Well then, señor, there
was once a rich tradesman who was
father to a very fine son. He brought
him up like a king's child, and, besides
the accomplishments of a gentleman,
in which the boy came to
excel, had him taught in all branches
as if he had meant to make him doctor
of every thing. The son grew to
be a young man with a will of his
own; bearded and dashing; and for
gallantry there was not another like
him.</p>

<p>One day he told his father that the
place had become too narrow for
him; he could not content himself
in it, and he wanted to go away.</p>

<p>"And where do you want to go?"
asked the father.</p>

<p>"To see the world," answered the
young man.</p>

<p>"You are like the grasshopper that
jumps he don't know where," said
the tradesman. "How are you to get
along in those strange countries without
experience?"</p>

<p>"Father, 'He that has knowledge
may go where he will,'" the son replied;
and as the old cock had allowed
the young one to run so much
to wings that he couldn't hold him,
the youth took his arms, his horse of
noble stirp, and set out to see the
world.</p>

<p>When he had travelled three days
through wilds and thickets, he came
up with a man who was carrying a
double cart-load&mdash;that is to say, a
hundred and fifty arrobas of taramee
upon his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Friend," said the young gentleman,
"you carry more than a church
mule. What is your name?"</p>

<p>"I am called Carry-much Carry-more,
son of The Stout Carrier," answered
the man.</p>

<p>"Would you like to come with
me?"</p>

<p>"If your worship is as much for
taking me as I am for going, yes."</p>

<p>So they went on together.</p>

<p>At the end of an hour they found
a man who was blowing hard enough
to burst his cheeks; sending forth
more wind than the bellows of the
forge of that <i>Bulcan</i><a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>
who, they say,
was a giant blacksmith, of those you
hear tell about.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" asked
the gentleman.</p>

<p>"Don't speak, your worship," said
the man, "for I mustn't leave off
blowing. I have to keep forty-five
mills a-going with my wind."</p>

<p>"And what is your name?"</p>

<p>"Blow-hard Blow-harder, son of
The Hard Blower," answered the
man.</p>

<p>"Will you come with me?"</p>

<p>"Indeed will I!" said the man;
"for I'm ready to collapse with blowing,
day in and day out, as many days
as God has put into the world."</p>

<p>A little further on, they stumbled
upon a man who was lying in wait,
listening.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" asked
the gentleman.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_838" id="Page_838">[838]</a></span></p>
<p>"I am waiting to hear a swarm of
mosquitoes rise out of the sea."</p>

<p>"Why, man! if the sea is a hundred
leagues off?"</p>

<p>"And what of that, if I hear
them?"</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Hear-all Hear-every-thing, son of
The Good Hearer."</p>

<p>"Will you come with me?"</p>

<p>"With all my heart, since your
worship is so kind; the mosquitoes
will announce their approach presently."</p>

<p>The four went along in love and
fellowship till they came in sight
of a castle so musty, lonesome, and
cloaked with gloom that it appeared
more like sepulchre of the dead than
habitation of the living. While they
were drawing nearer, the sky was
growing each moment more threatening,
and, as they reached the castle,
it burst into a torrent of rain; for size
and sound, every drop might have
been a cascabel.</p>

<p>"My master's worship needn't
mind it," said Blow-hard; "we'll soon
see what'll become of the storm."
And he began to blow. The clouds,
thunders, and lightnings scampered
across those skies in such hurry and
confusion that the sun stood squinting
after them, and the moon staring
open-mouthed with astonishment.</p>

<p>But this was not the worst; for
when they got to the castle, they
found that it had neither gate, nor
door, nor postern, nor sign of an entrance.</p>

<p>"I told your worship well," said
Hear-all, who had more fear than
shame, "that this ugly-faced castle
was only for a nest of magpies, and
refuge of owls."</p>

<p>"But I am tired, and I must rest,"
said the gentleman.</p>

<p>"Give yourself no uneasiness, your
worship," said Carry-much; and he
immediately brought a big boulder,
which he placed against the wall of
the castle. They climbed up by this,
and went in through the window. In
the hall they found tables spread with
the most famous dishes; all kinds of
liquors, jugs of pure water, and bread
of the finest quality. When they had
eaten till they could stuff no longer,
the gentleman wanted to explore the
castle.</p>

<p>"Señor," said Hear-all, "if you
meet somebody that asks, 'Where
is this ball rolling to?' One should
not make free in another's house unless
he is well posted."</p>

<p>"Who's afraid?" said Carry-much.
"We are not going to do any thing
wrong; and if one draws a straight
furrow, nobody will follow him with
a plough."</p>

<p>"Let us get away from here, my
master!" cried Hear-all, whose flesh
was creeping with fear. "This castle
is not in the grace of God; for I tell
your worship that I hear noises under
ground that sound like lamentations."</p>

<p>But the gentleman paid Hear-all no
attention. His servants followed him,
and they went on exploring those corridors
and passages that were more
intricate than if a lawyer had built
them, until they came into a yard
that was like an arena for bulls.</p>

<p>They had hardly set foot in it,
when a serpent with seven heads, each
one more fierce than the others,
seven tongues like lances, and fourteen
eyes like coals of fire, glided out
to attack them.</p>

<p>Carry-much, Blow-hard, and Hear-all,
more scared than rats found
out of the hole, ran as if they would
run out of their trowsers; but the
gentleman, who was as valiant as the
Cid and as strong as a Bernardo, drew
his sword, and with four strokes, and
four back-strokes, cut off the creature's
seven heads in less time than
you could say <i>tilen</i>! The biggest of
the seven glared at the gentleman for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_839" id="Page_839">[839]</a></span>
an instant with its savage eyes that
darted fire and blood, and then gave
a bound into the middle of the yard
and disappeared through a hole which
opened in the ground to receive it.</p>

<p>At the gentleman's call, the three
who had fled came back, and were
well astonished at their master's bravery.</p>

<p>"Be it known to you," said the
cavalier, who was looking, without
seeing bottom, down the hole the serpent's
head had gone into, "that we
are going now to the fields to get
hemp and palm-leaves to make a line
that will reach to the floor of this
well." They did so; and the four
spent four years making rope. At
the end of that time they felt it touch
bottom. The master then told Hear-all
to slide down it and see what was
below there, and come back and let him
know. But Hear-all stuck to his supports,
as upright as a palm-tree in a
gully that no wind moves, and said
that he'd be smashed first and go down
in pieces.</p>

<p>Then the master told Blow-hard
to go. Blow-hard took fast hold of
the rope, and descended night and
day till he got to the bottom, where
he found himself in a palace like the
famous ones you read of, and in the
presence of the Princess of Naples,
who was lying on a bed with her face
downward, weeping tears as big as
chick-peas. She told him that Lucifer
had fallen in love with her, and
would keep her enchanted there until
one willing and able to fight and
vanquish him should present himself.
'Here is one already who is going to
undertake the enterprise,' said Blow-hard,
and he drew in a long breath,
which was scarcely drawn when Lucifer
appeared in person. The sight
of him frightened Blow-hard so that
he ran and climbed to the top of a
door. Lucifer unhinged the door
with one thwack of his big tail, and
it fell to the ground with Blow-hard,
and broke one of his legs.</p>

<p>We will leave him with his bitter
cud, and go back to the gentleman,
who, tired of waiting for Blow-hard
to come up, asked Hear-all what was
going on down there in the bowels
of the earth. Hear-all told him what
had passed, and that now he could
hear Blow-hard complaining of a broken
leg. Then the gentleman sent
Carry-much, who assured him that
he would shoulder Lucifer and bring
him up, if he weighed more than
all the lead of the Sierra Almagrera.
But, step by step, it happened to Carry-much
just as it had to Blow-hard,
except that he got an arm broken instead
of a leg.</p>

<p>"I will go down myself," said the
gentleman, when Hear-all related to
him what had taken place.</p>

<p>When he reached the palace and
saw the Princess of Naples, he fell into
such love with her wonderful beauty
that he prepared himself for the encounter
with a double ration of valor.</p>

<p>Christians! such a fight as there
was then between the good cavalier
and the cursed dog of a Lucifer the
world has never seen; as, naturally, it
would not see, since Lucifer never
comes to fight above here in his own
form. But the gentleman crossed
himself, and, as every man must who
commends his cause to God, vanquished
the devil. He did more; for
he cut off one of his ears.</p>

<p>The state Lucifer would be in at
seeing his ear in the hands of a Christian,
I leave to your consideration.
His yells had such an effect upon
Hear-all that he repeated every jerk
and spring. You would have said
that he was being repeatedly stung
by a tarantula.</p>

<p>"Give me my ear!" shouted Lucifer
in the voice of a trumpet.</p>

<p>"You will give me a good ransom
if you get it," answered the cavalier;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_840" id="Page_840">[840]</a></span>
"for I have taken it like a true knight
in fair combat; therefore, I shall make
three conditions with which you must
comply."</p>

<p>"Insolent braggart!" said Lucifer.</p>

<p>"Oh! you may spit out the gall;
but I warn you that I am going to
pickle your ear and show it for money,"
replied the cavalier.</p>

<p>Lucifer danced with rage.</p>

<p>"What are your conditions, low-born,
ill-bred, and worse-thriven?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"The first is, that you instantly
return this princess to her own kingdom
and palace," said the cavalier.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to
comply; so Lucifer placed the princess
in her royal palace, and then said
to the cavalier, "Give me my ear."</p>

<p>"No," replied the cavalier; "you
must first transport me, with my three
servants and such a kingly suite as
becomes your vanquisher, to the court
of Naples, and into a suitable lodging,
which you will have prepared for
me."</p>

<p>"It does not suit me, little bully,
to have you diverting yourself, and
triumphing at my expense."</p>

<p>"Very well. I will publish, with
the sound of a clarion, that you have
lost an ear. We shall see then if you
can disguise yourself as a notary, lawyer,
agent, money-lender, or lover,
without being found out in less than
no time."</p>

<p>"Now," whimpered Lucifer, after
he had placed the cavalier in Naples,
with great riches and an immense retinue,
"give me my ear."</p>

<p>"I have it here," said the cavalier,
"and I don't want it, for it smells of
sulphur; but you have yet to fulfil
the third condition."</p>

<p>"What is it, impudent upstart?"</p>

<p>"I am not quite ready to tell it.
In the mean time, have patience,
which, if it will not serve you to gain
heaven, will be of use to you in getting
back your ear."</p>

<p>Lucifer changed from poison to
the essence of venom. "You are seven
times worse than I," said he to
his vanquisher. "By the soul of Napoleon!
there is more knavery on
earth than in hell. But you shall remember
me! By my horns and tail, I
swear it!" And off he went, pulling at
his remaining ear for vexation at finding
himself outwitted by a Christian.</p>

<p>Well, when the princess saw the
cavalier so finely gotten up, and with
such a splendid following, she recognized
him, and told her father that he
was her saviour! and that she wished
to marry him. They were married;
<i>and I was there, and saw, and
came away, and nothing was said to
me; for I slipped in and out without
being seen</i>;<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>
mindful of the saying,
"Neither to wedding nor christening
go unbidden."</p>

<p>But, señor, you must know that,
after the wedding-bread was eaten,
the princess and the cavalier led a
cat-and-dog's life together; for the
woman's temper and manners had become
so bad and intolerable while she
remained under the power of Lucifer
that no one else could abide them.
So, when the devil appeared to beg
for his ear, the cavalier said to him,</p>

<p>"I am going to give it to you;
but you must comply with the last
condition I impose for its ransom."</p>

<p>"Knave! Mountebank! You
would damn me if I were not damned
already! And what is this last condition?"</p>

<p>"That you take my wife again,"
responded the cavalier; "for you are
like for like, Peter for John."</p>

<h2>
THE VATICAN COUNCIL.</h2>

<p class="center">NUMBER TWO.<br />
</p>


<p>We intimated in our last number
our intention of presenting each
month to the readers of <span class="smcap">The Catholic
World</span> an article on the progress,
and, so far as we could, on the
proceedings of the Vatican Council,
now in session. We shall endeavor,
in so doing, to state facts, the accuracy
of which we can guarantee. Misstatements,
silly, absurd, and not unfrequently
mischievous, are sent by
"our own correspondents," to fill the
columns of hostile newspapers; and
they may sometimes disturb the minds
and sadden the hearts of the unwary.
We wish to give such an account as
shall correct such errors and misstatements,
by an accurate and impartial
statement of the truth. Our form of
a monthly publication may subject us
to some delay, and to the disadvantage
of saying much which our readers
will have already seen in the
daily and weekly press. But on the
other hand, it will secure for us fuller
and more accurate knowledge of our
subject than could be obtained at an
earlier period, and may enable us,
perhaps, to form a more mature judgment
on many points. Our aim is
to give a series of articles, which our
readers may preserve and refer to hereafter.
In writing them, we are guided
by information derived from the
best sources.</p>

<p>The amount and the variety of
misstatements and of mistakes about
the council and its doings, that have
fallen even under our own eyes, would
seem incredible. The talent of fiction
seems to have attained a truly marvellous
development. We tried to
classify them. There were fictions to
blame, and fictions to praise, fictions
droll, fictions malicious, fictions stupid,
fictions about persons, fictions about
things, fictions about words, fictions
about the past, fictions about the present,
fictions in the shape of conjectures
of the future, fictions gay and
witty, fictions solemn and dull, fictions
pious, and fictions blasphemous.</p>

<p>But then even this stream of incorrect
statements, the result of imagination
striving to eke out a scanty knowledge
of facts, or of prejudice looking
at every thing through a distorted
medium, is poured forth to satisfy, if
it can, the cravings of the public, and
is an additional evidence of the intense
and universal interest the Council
of the Vatican has excited. Men
may misrepresent it, they may hate
it, or fear it. They cannot despise
it. It seems they cannot be silent
about it.</p>

<p>The time has not yet come to speak
of the results of the deliberations of
this venerable body. Perhaps it is
well that it is so. As yet, our minds
are still dazzled and preoccupied by
the outward splendor and the striking
external aspects of the council.
Everywhere in Rome, you hear men
commenting on these points, and comparing
the present &oelig;cumenical council
with those which the church has
celebrated in the past centuries of her
existence.</p>

<p>But once before in her history were
so many bishops gathered together.
In the second Lateran Council, assembled
by Pope Innocent III., in
1139, about one thousand bishops
united. The next largest number was
at Chalcedon in 451, where six hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_842" id="Page_842">[842]</a></span>
and thirty bishops assembled;
and next to that came the second
Council of Lyons in 1274, under Gregory
X., at which five hundred were
present. Of the other councils, one
had over four hundred bishops, five
over three hundred, and the others all
fell below that number.</p>

<p>Since the day of the opening not a
few additional bishops have arrived,
and the total number now taking part
in the present council cannot fall below
seven hundred and fifty. The
Vatican Council stands, therefore, by
a mere count of numbers second on
the list. But, as a representation of
the entire world, it far exceeds all that
have preceded it.</p>

<p>The remarkable punctuality with
which the council was opened is a
subject of surprise and gratification,
and may well be looked on as a signal
evidence of the protection of divine
providence. It has not always happened
that councils could meet at the
time and the place first indicated in
the bull for their convocation. Sometimes
only a comparatively small number
of bishops could assemble; and
weeks and months, and perhaps a
year would pass by, before such a
number could gather together as to
render the opening of the council advisable.
The difficulties of journeying
were great. Oftentimes political jealousies,
and the wars of nations, interfered
to delay and embarrass, if
they could not altogether thwart, the
meeting, as well as the action of the
council. Something of this kind was
anticipated by many in the present
instance. When, in 1867, Pius IX., in
his address to the assembled bishops,
stated his purpose of holding a sacred
&oelig;cumenical council of the bishops
of the whole world, in order that, with
their united counsels and labors, necessary
and salutary remedies might,
by God's help, be applied to the many
evils under which the church suffers,
the heart of the Catholic world
thrilled with delight. But among infidels
and non-Catholics, and even
lukewarm Catholics, or those of little
faith, there was many a jest and many
a sneer. Many a paper assured its
readers that the council would not,
could not assemble; and some, who
thought themselves well informed, declared
that before the day for opening
it would arrive, Garibaldi would be
in Rome, and Pius IX. a wanderer
and a fugitive, far from the Vatican.
Plans were even then being laid to
bring this about; and, ere many
months rolled by, a well-prepared and
vigorous attempt was made to carry
them into effect. The attempt signally
failed. The battle of Mentana forbade
its renewal in that shape for some
time to come; and the storm, at one
moment so threatening, passed by.
The council was called, and the place
and the day of its meeting appointed.
What Garibaldi and his party had
failed to effect by arms, diplomacy
now attempted in another guise. The
chief minister of a so-called Catholic
power professed to entertain great apprehensions
of the possible results of
the council, and sent a secret circular
to the courts of the other Catholic
nations of Europe, urging the expediency
of united action in such shape
as might control the decisions of the
council. Had the plan been adopted,
and the spirit in which it was conceived
been carried out in the details,
the result would probably have been
what the originators intended, and
what indeed some of their papers announced
to the world as already determined
on. The council would
have been postponed, perhaps would
not have met at all. But this plan
failed too. The circular was received
coldly, and the proposal fell to the
ground. Under the guiding hand of
Providence, all was peaceful. The
bishops (save those under the Czar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_843" id="Page_843">[843]</a></span>
of Russia) were free to travel in
peace; and they came at the voice of
the chief pastor. From the volcanic
and coral islands of the Pacific, from
Hudson's Bay and Labrador and
Canada, from Brazil, La Plata, and
Chili, from the golden shores of California,
from rugged New England and
the fertile valley of the Mississippi,
from mysterious Egypt, and the classic
isles of Greece, from the sacred
hills and cities of Palestine and Syria,
from the stricken remnants of Assyria
and Media, from Persia, India, Burmah,
Siam, and China, bishops were
journeying toward the central city of
the Catholic world. The antipodal
Australia and New Zealand sent
still others. From every country of
Europe, Hungary, Bohemia, Illyria,
Austria. Prussia, Bavaria, and Würtemberg,
France, Spain, and Portugal,
England, Holland, Belgium, Scotland,
and Ireland, the Island of Saints,
they came, not merely a few delegates,
but it seemed the entire episcopal
body <i>en masse</i>. Distance and difficulties
of the journey were no obstacles;
even old age and infirmities
seemed to have lost the power of retaining
these prelates at home. Among
the arrivals in Rome over a score had
passed eighty years of age, and one,
not the least vigorous among them,
had reached the mature age of ninety-five.
And so it came to pass, under
the blessing of Heaven, that in this
nineteenth century, in which even
that profound statesman and excellent
Catholic, Count De Maistre, once
said it would be simply impossible to
convene a general council of the
church, all difficulties have vanished,
and without one hour's delay or postponement,
the Vatican Council, exceeding
all others save one in its
number of prelates, and far surpassing
that one in its intrinsic grandeur, was
opened in the majestic Basilica of St.
Peter, on the day and the hour originally
appointed. We may trust
that the blessing of Heaven will continue
with it, and that its results will
be commensurate with the prayers and
hopes of the Catholic world, in promoting
the glory of God, in establishing
the kingdom of Christ our Lord
on earth, and in leading men to
Christian holiness and eternal life.</p>

<p>In our former article we gave an
account of the grand spectacle presented
at the opening session. In
the present one, we will speak of the
general congregations, or committees
of the whole, as we would term them,
in which most of the work is to be
done. The curious observer will find
here many of those old rules and
forms from which the modern and
civilized world has derived our existing
codes of parliamentary rules. It
is interesting to observe the points of
agreement and of disagreement. For
of later years, in our mundane parliaments,
the strife of party spirit, and
sometimes the necessity of settling a
question by a given time, have brought
in various devices unknown in those
older and quieter assemblies for the
purpose of shutting off debate, or
overcoming the reluctance of a minority
for a speedy vote.</p>

<p>An &oelig;cumenical council is, under
one point of view, a deliberative assembly
of the entire Catholic Church.
The sovereign pontiff, who, as successor
of St. Peter, the head of the apostolic
college in the see of Rome, is
head of the Catholic Church and the
centre of unity, presides <i>ex-officio</i>.
As his right and his power were not
bestowed on him by the church, but
were instituted by her Divine Founder
as an essential part of her organization,
it follows that they do not cease, or
suffer suspension, on occasion of, or
during the holding of a council.</p>

<p>His office in reference to councils
has been recognized from the beginning.
A Council of Alexandria, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_844" id="Page_844">[844]</a></span>
their letter to Pope Felix II., in the
year 362, wrote: "We know that in
the great Council of Nice all the
bishops unanimously declared that
councils should not be held save
with the judgment of the Roman
pontiff," and Julius I., in his first letter
to the eastern churches, appealed to
the ancient laws of the church, which
forbade "the holding of councils without
the knowledge and assent of the
Roman pontiff, because the Holy
Roman Church held the primacy
over all the churches." In the first
place, then, an &oelig;cumenical council
must be <i>summoned</i> by the authority
of the pope. In the second place,
he <i>presides</i> in the council <i>ex-officio</i>,
either personally or by such legates
as he may send. The First Council
of Nice in Bithynia was held in 325.
Three hundred and eighteen bishops
were present, all of them (save half
a dozen) patriarchs, archbishops, and
bishops from the east. Osius, a
bishop of Spain, and two priests from
Rome, presided in the name of Pope
Sylvester. Meletius of Antioch, and
afterward St. Gregory of Nazianzum,
presided in the name of Pope Damasus
in the First Council of Constantinople,
in 381. St. Cyril of Alexandria
presided at the Council of Ephesus
in 431, in the name of Pope St.
Celestine I. St. Leo the Great sent
two bishops, Pascasinus and Lucentius,
and two priests, Boniface and
Basil, who conjointly represented him,
and presided over the Fourth General
Council at Chalcedon, in the year 451.
The same right has been exercised in
every succeeding &oelig;cumenical council.
Nor could it be otherwise. The body
cannot be separated from the head
without destroying the life of the
church. The gates of hell would
then have assuredly prevailed over
her.</p>

<p>A third right and office of the
sovereign pontiff in relation to &oelig;cumenical
councils is that of <em>confirming</em>
and giving force to their decrees.
His is the supreme duty and charge
of confirming his brethren in the faith.
Pope St. Damasus expressed the Catholic
doctrine and practice on this
head fifteen hundred years ago, when
he wrote to the bishops of an African
council, "You well know, that to
hold councils without the authority
and approval of the Roman see is
not according to the Catholic spirit;
nor do we meet any councils that
are held as legitimate which were
not supported by its apostolic confirmation."
The words of Pope Damasus
were then specially significant
and emphatic. Not a quarter of a
century before, in 363, six hundred
bishops had assembled at Rimini,
and, under pressure from the Emperor
Constantius, had passed decrees
which Pope Liberius reprobated. At
once, and ever since, that Council of
Rimini has been held as utterly destitute
of authority.</p>

<p>An &oelig;cumenical council, therefore, to
be truly such, must be convoked by
the sovereign pontiff, or by his authority,
must be presided over by him,
either in person or by his legates, and
its acts must be confirmed and sanctioned
by him.</p>

<p>To say he has the duty of judging
when the necessities or dangers of the
church render it proper to summon a
general council, in order to meet or to
remedy them, implies obviously that
he will propose to the council the
matters on which he calls for their
judgment and their coöperation
with him. As president <i>ex-officio</i>, it
is his duty to make such arrangements
in accordance with the spirit of religion,
and the usages of former councils,
as will facilitate and expedite the
action of the council, and allow the
bishops to return as quickly as possible
to their flocks.</p>

<p>In the present instance, the sovereign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_845" id="Page_845">[845]</a></span>
pontiff has done this chiefly by
the brief, <i>Multiplices inter</i>, and by the
labors of the five preparatory commissions,
which have for nearly a
year and a half been studying up the
subjects which are to form a portion
of the matter to be discussed and decided
on by the council.</p>

<p>We have already spoken of this
apostolic letter, <i>Multiplices inter</i>. It
was dated November 27th, and having
been printed in pamphlet form,
was delivered to the bishops on December
2d, nearly a week before the
opening of the council. There are
ten chapters in it, several of which set
forth the mode of procedure which
will be followed in the council in the
transaction of business.</p>

<p>Chapter ii. is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Although the right and duty of proposing
the matters to be treated in the
Holy &OElig;cumenical Council, and of asking
the judgments of the fathers on them, belongs
only to us and this apostolic see,
yet we not only desire, but we exhort, that
if any among the fathers of the council
have any thing to propose which they
believe will tend to the general benefit,
they shall freely propose it. However, as
we clearly perceive that this, unless it be
done in proper time and mode, may seriously
disturb the necessary order of the business
of the council, we direct that such proposals
be offered in this mode, to wit: 1.
Each one must be put in writing, and be
directly delivered to a special congregation
(committee) composed of several cardinals
and fathers of the council, to be appointed
by us. 2. It must regard the general welfare
of the church, not the special benefit of
only this or that diocese. 3. It must set
forth the reasons for which it is held useful
and opportune. 4. It must not run counter
to the constant belief of the church, and her
inviolable traditions. The said special congregation
shall diligently weigh the propositions
delivered to it, and shall report to us
their recommendation as to the admission
or exclusion of them, in order that, after
mature deliberation, we may decide whether
or not they shall be placed before the council
for discussion."</p></blockquote>

<p>We may say here that this special
committee has been appointed, and
is composed of twelve cardinals and
fourteen prelates. Of the cardinals
five are usually resident in Rome,
three are from sees in Italy, one is
French, one Spanish, one German,
and one (Cardinal Cullen) from Ireland.
Of the prelates, two are patriarchs
from the East, one is French,
two Spanish, four Italians, one South
American, one (Archbishop Spalding)
from the United States, one Mexican,
one English, one Belgian, and one
German. This committee is thus an
admirable synopsis, as it were, of the
entire council. Their duties may hereafter
be delicate and responsible. So
far, we believe, they have not been
called on to act.</p>

<p>Chapters v. and vii. of the same
apostolic letter set forth that, for
the rapid furthering of business, there
shall be six other standing committees,
the members of all of which
shall be elected by ballot, in the
council: 1. On excuses for non-attendance,
or for leave of absence,
to consist of five members. 2. On
grievances and complaints, likewise
to consist of five members. 3. On
matters of faith, to consist of twenty-four
members. 4. On matters of discipline,
with twenty-four members.
5. One on regular orders, with twenty-four
members; and 6. One on oriental
rites and on missions, to consist
of twenty-four members. These last
four committees, or <i>deputations</i>, as
they are termed, will be presided over
each by a cardinal, to be appointed
by the pope.</p>

<p>Chapter vi. appoints the officers
and attendants required in the council.
Prince John Colonna and Prince
Dominic Orsini are sergeants-at-arms.
What a change from the days, seven
centuries ago, when their ancestors
would meet only as rivals at court, or
antagonists in the field! The Rt. Rev.
Joseph Fessler, of Germany, is named
secretary of the council, with an under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_846" id="Page_846">[846]</a></span>
secretary and two assistants. Seven
notaries are named, and eight
scrutatores or tellers, for receiving and
counting the votes. Among these
last is Monsignor Nardi, well known
to the foreign visitors to Rome. The
promotors, masters of ceremony, and
ushers are also named in this chapter.</p>

<p>Finally, the sovereign pontiff, who
would preside in person only in the
solemn sessions, designated five cardinals
who, in his name and by his
authority, would preside in the general
congregations. They were Cardinals
De Reisach, De Luca, Bizzarri,
Bilio, and Capalti.</p>

<p>The apostolic letter also set forth
how the several committees of theologians
had prepared <i>schemata</i>, or
draughts, as we would term them, on
various points belonging to the general
purposes of the council. The Holy
Father declared that he had abstained
from giving to these draughts any
sanction of approval. They would
be placed in the hands of the bishops
for their serious study and for their
discussion, (<i>integra integre</i>,) freely, and
as to every part.</p>

<p>These arrangements were held to
be sufficient at least in the commencement.
Should it appear during the
progress of the council that additional
measures are necessary, it is obvious
that they can, at any time, easily be
provided by the fathers.</p>

<p>In our account of the grand ceremonial
of opening the council, we
stated that the second decree appointed
a second solemn session to be held
on the festival of the Epiphany, January
6th. The bishops were also informed
that the first general congregation
would be held on Friday, December
10th, at nine <span class="smcap">A.M.</span></p>

<p>On that morning, by half-past eight,
thousands were waiting in the grand
nave of St. Peter's, to see the bishops
as they arrived and passed up its
length, to reach the council hall, in
the transept, to the right of the main
altar. Hundreds remained to see
them come out at the conclusion of
the meeting. On each of the ten
times since then that the bishops have
met in general congregation, there
was the crowd of Romans and of
strangers. In truth, under some respects,
this occasion seems almost as
interesting as a public session. The
bishops come, not in procession, but
singly, or in groups of two, three, or
four, as they may chance to arrive at
the door of St. Peter's. They are
robed not in cope and mitre, but simply
in rochet and mantelletta, and as
they gravely walk up the nave, you
have a full opportunity to scan their
features and study their bearing, their
size, and to read the thousand and
one indications of character by which,
whether correctly or incorrectly, men
will ever form some judgment of
those they look on. Most of them
bear in their hands portfolios for writing,
and large quarto pamphlets which
have been distributed to them. They
look as if they had been studying,
and were still preoccupied with matters
of importance.</p>

<p>They enter the door of the council
hall, and each one passes to his numbered
seat. Some open their pamphlets,
some are writing, some are
conversing in whispers. At nine <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>
the main door is closed. Whoever
comes late must enter by a side door.
Mass of the Holy Ghost is celebrated
by some one of the prelates, without
music. At its conclusion, the presiding
cardinals take their places. All
kneel while the chief cardinal reads
the prayers prescribed for the occasion.
When he concludes, all rise,
are seated, and the congregation is
opened.</p>

<p>On December 10th, only four of
the presiding cardinals were in their
places. The chief one, Cardinal De<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_847" id="Page_847">[847]</a></span>
Reisach, was absent in Switzerland,
whither he had gone for his health.
He has since died there. Born in
Bavaria, in 1806, of a noble family,
his rank, his talents, and his personal
accomplishments, and the prospect of
a brilliant career before him, gathered
around him a circle of admirers
and hopeful friends, as, at the age of
twenty, he took his place in the court
of King Louis. Pure and delicate
as a girl, loving piety, and dreading
the seductions of the world, he soon
gave up all the world offered, and
withdrew to devote himself to the
sanctuary. He came to Rome, to
pursue his theological studies in the
German College, graduated with honors,
was ordained priest, and soon
after, when not thirty years of age,
was appointed rector of the celebrated
College of the Propaganda. His
memory is dear to all those students,
now scattered through the world, who
had the happiness of being under his
paternal care. In 1836, he was consecrated
Bishop of Eichstadt, in his
native land, and afterward was made
Archbishop of Munich. In both
these offices he displayed that zeal,
and wisdom, and firmness, united with
kindest charity, of which his earlier
years had given such promise. He
was finally made cardinal, and resigning
the archbishopric of Munich,
came several years ago to reside again
in Rome. For some time past his
health was impaired. He was president
of one of the preparatory committees
of theologians and canonists
for the council, and it is thought that
his excessive labors as such contributed
not a little to break his health
down. In September he left Rome,
never to return. In his death, the
Vatican Council has lost one who
would have been a most able presiding
cardinal.</p>

<p>On December 10th, Cardinal De
Luca, the next in rank, took his place,
and made a brief and eloquent address
to the fathers. It was of course
in Latin, the language of the council.
The bishops voted by ballot, first,
for the five members of the committee
on excuses, and then, a second
time, for the five members of the
committee on complaints. As the
fathers voting were over seven hundred,
as each one voted for ten persons,
and as the voting was very
scattering, it was obvious that the
ballots could not be counted then
and there. They were therefore placed
in boxes, which were publicly sealed;
and a committee, consisting of
the senior patriarch, the senior primate,
the senior archbishop, the senior
bishop, and the senior mitred abbot,
was appointed to superintend the
counting of these votes the next day,
and to superintend the counting hereafter
the votes to be cast in the coming
elections. The ushers then delivered
to each of the bishops a copy
of the first draught, or <i>schema</i>, on doctrinal
matters. The concluding prayer
was said, and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>The prelates elected on the committee
of excuses were, Melchers,
Archbishop of Cologne; Monzon y
Martins, Archbishop of Granada;
Limberti, Archbishop of Florence;
Landriot, Archbishop of Rheims;
and Pedicini, Archbishop of Bari.</p>

<p>Those elected on the committee
of complaints were, Angelini, Archbishop
of Corinth; Mermillod, Bishop
of Geneva; Sannibale, Bishop of Gubbio;
Rosati, Bishop of Todi; and
Canzi, Bishop of Cyrene.</p>

<p>On the 14th of December, a second
general congregation was held. After
the celebration of mass and the opening
prayers, two documents were distributed
to the bishops. The first
had special reference to the council.
It was a "constitution" on the election
of the Roman pontiff, should the
apostolic see become vacant during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_848" id="Page_848">[848]</a></span>
the &oelig;cumenical council. Referring
to the long-established laws of the
church as to such a case, the decrees
of several sovereign pontiffs in times
past, and the clear precedents in the
history of several general councils,
the Holy Father now anew decrees
and ordains "that if it please God to
put an end to our mortal course during
the General Council of the Vatican,
whatever may be the position of the
council and the state of the business
on which it is engaged, the election
of the new sovereign pontiff must
be made by the cardinals alone, the
council having no share therein."
And he further decrees and ordains
that "if our death occur during the
said Vatican Council, this council, in
whatever state it may be, and whatever
be the position of the works on
which it is engaged, is forthwith and
immediately to be deemed suspended
and adjourned. The council must
therefore at once abstain from holding
any meeting, congregation, or
session; it must not make any decree
or canon, nor take any proceeding,
until such time as the new pontiff,
having been canonically elected by
the sacred college of cardinals, judges
right, in virtue of his supreme authority,
to ordain that the council be resumed
and continued."</p>

<p>A cloud of sadness, we are told,
seemed to fall on the assembly of
prelates as they read this rehearsal
and reënactment of the law of the
church for the case contemplated&mdash;a
case by no means impossible; for
Pius IX. has reached the ripe old age
of fourscore, and in his pontificate is
fast approaching "the years of Peter."
They thought, doubtless, of their distant
homes and their flocks, so dear
to their hearts; they thought of the
council they were just entering on,
and remembered how often other
councils had lasted years. Yet from
many a heart a prayer went up that
not by his death should this council
cease; many a lip spoke the words,
<i>Vivat, diu vivat Pius Nonus</i>. Were it
not for the sanctity of the place, and
the graveness of the assembly, the low
spoken words would have been loud
acclamations ringing through St. Peter's.</p>

<p>The second paper did not directly
refer to the council, and we would
not speak of it here had it not been
made the subject of so many remarks
and so much misrepresentation in
many secular papers. It was a bull
revoking and annulling many of the
censures and penalties enacted in
times past by the canon law against
various offences.</p>

<p>A little thought will make the matter
clear. The church has power, and
has always exercised it, to inflict her
censures and penalties on grievous
offenders. Such penalties, intended
to deter from evil, and to procure, if
possible, the amendment of the offender,
must be prudently adapted to the
circumstances of time and place.
Many things must be taken into consideration.
Hence, it will happen
that what is beneficial at one time is
hurtful at another. What in one age,
or in one condition of a country,
would repress the evil, may in another
age, or under different circumstances,
be found to aggravate it.</p>

<p>Hence, in the body of canon law,
commenced as it was eleven centuries
ago, and embracing, in fact, many
laws of a far more ancient date, it
is not surprising to find many laws
which, however wise at the time of
their enactment, are no longer applicable
with prudence, and which the
church has centuries ago let fall into
desuetude and oblivion. There are
other laws concerning which this action
may even now be going on. In
some countries it may be more advanced
than in others. To some
minds it may be clearer than to others.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_849" id="Page_849">[849]</a></span>
Hence, for some time past, and especially
on occasion of the council,
representations have been made in
Rome on the subject. The sovereign
pontiff, after mature consideration, and
taking advice of his counsellors, has
by this bull withdrawn and repealed
all the censures and ecclesiastical penalties
at any time in ages past enacted
by his predecessors, excepting those
of which he gives a special and definite
list in the bull. These he leaves
as they were; all others he abrogates.</p>

<p>At this second congregation a ballot
was taken for the members of the
committee or deputation on matters
of faith. Each prelate voted for twenty-four
persons. There were seven
hundred and twenty-one votes cast.
They were sealed up as before, in the
presence of the council, and were
afterward counted. The result was
as follows:</p>

of Saragossa, Spain.</p>

<p>This is looked on as the most important
committee of the council; and
it is gratifying to us, and honorable
to the Catholic Church of the United
States, that two of our archbishops
should be placed on it.</p>

<p>A third general congregation was
held on the 21st of December, for the

<p>This fourth congregation was one
of importance and special interest, for
at this meeting the discussion of the
<i>schema</i>, or draught, on certain matters
regarding faith, given to the bishops
on December 10th, was to commence.
Originally, and to the great mortification
of the architect, the noble hall
prepared for the council was found
to be unsuited for speaking. Its size,
the loftiness of the roof, and its communication
aloft with the nave and
the dome, seemed to render even
strong voices inaudible. When the
secretaries made announcements, they
were forced to repeat the same words
two or three times from different positions,
that all might hear. To hold
discussions there seemed impossible.
Various halls in the Vatican Palace
were measured. Several churches
were examined; and at one time it
was almost decided to try a hall in
the distant Quirinal Palace. But, before
doing so, the architect tried other
plans in the council hall itself, and
has finally succeeded in remedying
the evils complained of in a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_851" id="Page_851">[851]</a></span>
simple manner, and to the satisfaction
of all. The hall itself is, as we have
said, the north wing of the transept,
divided from the rest of the church
by a partition wall, rising about one
third of the way to the vaulted ceiling
above. Its dimensions are about two
hundred feet in length by almost one
hundred in breadth, and the ceiling
is over one hundred and fifty feet
high. Its southern end, toward the
church, is square. The other end is
the semi-circular apse of the transept.
This apse is occupied by an elevated
platform, on which, in the middle, is
the throne of the sovereign pontiff.
The cardinals are seated in lines on
either side of him, and before them
are seated the patriarchs. All this
occupies nearly one third of the hall.
For the other two thirds, lines of seats
stretch down on either side, from the
platform to the partition wall, giving
ample room for all the bishops. In
the middle, between these rows of
seats, stretches an ample space down
to the broad door. Toward the platform
there are here and there in it
tables and seats for the secretaries,
notaries, and other officials. Nearer
the door stands the altar, and near by
the movable pulpit. The alteration
consists in this: a second partition
wall, of light materials, is thrown
across the hall, about one third of
the way from the door, cutting off
the altar and one half of the seats on
either side. The prelates who occupied
these seats are now placed in
other temporary seats in the middle
space and on the platform. As the
Holy Father does not preside in the
congregations, his throne is removed,
and thus room is obtained in the apse
for another altar, at which the mass
is celebrated. At its conclusion, the
presiding cardinals come forward and
take their places in seats in front of
the altar. The pulpit stands opposite,
against the middle of the new
partition; and the loss of voice by its
passage aloft into the church is prevented
by an awning overhead, stretching
entirely across the hall, and extending
from the partition some
twenty-five feet forward.</p>

<p>In a solemn session all this change
disappears. The second partition and
the awning are taken away. The
prelates occupy their old places; the
second altar is removed; the pope's
throne is restored; and the services are
at the original altar. All is brought
back again for the next congregation.
A few hours suffice to put it up or
take it away.</p>

<p>In the congregation of December
28th, after the voting had ended, and
the ballots had been sealed up as
usual, to be afterward counted, the
presiding cardinal announced that the
discussion on the first <i>schema</i>, or
draught, on matters of faith, would now
commence, and that fourteen prelates
had already given notice of their intention
to speak. They would have
precedence of all others, and would
be heard in their order of rank and
seniority. Seven spoke that day, all
of course in Latin. First was Cardinal
Rauscher, of Vienna. The second
of the number was the learned Archbishop
of St. Louis. The seventh
was the eloquent Archbishop Connolly,
of Halifax. The discussion
was continued on the 29th, when, in
addition to the seven who remained
over from the day before, a second,
list of ten additional speakers was announced.
On the 3d of January,
the Bishop of Savannah spoke; and
a third list of five more speakers was
given in on the 4th. On the 8th,
still nine speakers in addition sent in
their names; all was closed at the
sitting of January 11th. In all, thirty-five
speakers addressed the council.
Three others, who were to speak,
stated that what they intended to say
had already been fully treated of by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_852" id="Page_852">[852]</a></span>
other speakers, and in such manner
as to render any repetition unnecessary.
The speakers were from North
America, South America, France,
Spain, Italy, Prussia, Belgium, Austria,
Hungary, Greece, Armenia, and
Chaldea. The Latin was their common
language, and it was wonderful
with what correctness and readiness
all spoke it. Some of them&mdash;the
Italians and Hungarians especially&mdash;were
as fluent as if it were their
mother-tongue&mdash;as indeed it almost
is for them. The nationality of the
speaker might generally be known at
once by the intonations of his voice
and the peculiarities of his pronunciation.
But the widest differences heard
there did not prevent their perfectly
understanding each other. There
was no one to use the "English"
pronunciation of Latin. Had <em>that</em>
been heard, the majority of the
bishops would have thought it some
dialect of English. As it was, the
variations seemed like the differences
of English, Irish, Scotch, and American
orators, who all speak the same
language, each with a marked accent
and peculiar mode of pronunciation;
yet all are perfectly intelligible to
each other.</p>

<p>But these peculiarities were forgotten,
as the prelates bent forward to
catch the calm and earnest words, in
which the successive speakers brought
their intimate knowledge of the Holy
Scriptures, of the traditions of the
church, of the acute reasoning of the
scholastics, of modern philosophy, of
history, ecclesiastical and civil, and
of modern sciences in their most advanced
stages, to bear on the subjects
before them. The speakers
seemed somewhat awed by the majesty
of the assembly, but they spoke
firmly and freely; for they were fulfilling
a sacred duty in thus expressing
their matured thoughts and earnest
convictions. There was no applause.
It would scarce comport with the dignity
of the assembly. The prelates
listened in silence and attentively, and
seemed to weigh carefully the merits
of each argument or criticism as it
dropped from the lips of the speaker.</p>

<p>All these discourses were carefully
taken down by the stenographers of
the council, and were immediately
written out. At the conclusion of the
discussion, the <i>Schema</i> itself which had
been discussed, and all the speeches
on it, were referred to the deputation
or committee on faith, who will
make such alterations and amendments
in it as a careful weighing of
the remarks made may show to be
advisable. In this amended form,
it will come again before the congregation
for further consideration, and
ultimately for approval or rejection.
In the mean time, other <i>schemata</i> or
draughts on discipline have been
placed in the hands of the prelates,
to be studied, discussed, and acted on
in a similar way.</p>

<p>In the congregation of January
3d, the death of Cardinal Reisach,
chief of the presiding cardinals, was
announced. He had not been able to
return from Switzerland to take his
seat in the council. It was also announced
that the holy father had
appointed Cardinal De Angelis to
fill the vacant place. Cardinal de
Angelis is Bishop of Fermo, in Italy,
and is a hale old man, approaching
seventy years of age. He has suffered
not a little from the government
of Victor Emanuel, and is looked on
as a confessor like those of the earlier
ages of the church. He was imprisoned,
maltreated, taken away from
his see, and kept for years <i>in domicilio
coatto</i>, under arrest, as we would
say, and forbidden to go beyond certain
restricted limits. He was set at
liberty about two years ago. He is a
bishop of vast learning, full of zeal and
energy, and of unshakable firmness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_853" id="Page_853">[853]</a></span>
His sufferings have made him the
idol of the clergy of Italy. They
hold him a most worthy successor of
the lamented Reisach.</p>

<p>On the festival of the Epiphany of
our Lord, January 6th, the second
solemn session of the Vatican Council
was held. There was no procession.
The prelates, having robed in
cope and mitre in the adjoining chapels,
entered the hall singly or in
groups, and took each his proper
place. At nine o'clock, the cardinals
and sovereign pontiff entered. Cardinal
Patrizi celebrated the high mass.
The music was by the unequalled
choir of the Sistine Chapel. The
crowd of strangers and Romans
gathered in St. Peter's, though not
so large as on the day of the opening,
was still immense. At the conclusion
of the mass, the book of the
gospels was reverently enthroned on
the altar, the pontiff chanted the usual
prayers, the Litany of the Saints was
intoned, and the responses swelled
and rang through the vast church as
the bishops and thousands of the
assistants sang them in unison. As
on the first day, the pontiff arose toward
the end of the Litany, and thrice
blessed the kneeling assembly, and
prayed the Saviour to bless, to sanctify,
and to preserve and protect this
holy council; and stronger and grander
than before rolled the united answer,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te rogamus, audi nos</i>. Other prayers
followed the Litany. A gospel was
chanted, and the holy father intoned
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Veni Creator</i>. The choir took
up the strain, and the body of prelates
responded in the alternate verses.
The usual prayer to the Holy Ghost
followed. The time for the special
business of the session had come. It
was to make the solemn profession
of faith, which, by the laws of the
church, is required in every ecclesiastical
synod or council.</p>

<p>The promotors, approaching the
holy father, knelt and asked that
this be now done. He assented, and
arose, and put off his mitre. All
arose, and stood uncovered. In his
own clear, ringing voice, in tones that
filled the hall, and passed out to the
multitude beyond in the church&mdash;so
clear that words could be caught far
off at the other end of the transept&mdash;he
read slowly and solemnly the profession
of Catholic faith, in the form
of Pius IV., and seemed to lay special
stress on the declaration that in his
heart he held and professed this holy
faith, and would hold it, with God's
blessing, until death, and concluded,
"I, Pius, Bishop of the Catholic
Church, so promise, vow, and swear.
So help me God, and these holy gospels,"
and kissed the book of gospels.
He was then seated. The prelates
remained standing as before, while
one of their number read, in a clear
voice, the same profession in their
name. When he had concluded, the
masters of ceremony placed a book
of the gospels on the knees of the
pontiff, and one by one the cardinals
approached, according to their rank,
and confirmed the profession, "I,
Constantine, Cardinal Patrizi, promise,
vow, and swear, according to
the form just read. So help me God,
and these holy gospels," and kissed
the book. After the cardinals came
the patriarchs and primates, and then
the archbishops and bishops. It was,
in truth, a sublime evidence of the
truth and the living force of our holy
religion to behold these prelates of
the church, assembled from every
quarter of the globe, gradually passing
down from their seats, as their
turn came, to join the line that was
slowly passing up the centre of the
hall toward the throne of the pontiff,
that, kneeling before him, each one
might personally unite in this solemn
profession of a common faith. The
crowd seemed electrified, and at times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_854" id="Page_854">[854]</a></span>
almost melted to tears as they saw
some aged prelate, with tottering step,
assisted up the steps of the platform
by the masters of ceremony, and
again carefully and gently aided, as
he came down, or a blind bishop led
on by the hand, that he might unite
with his brethren. The world was
dark to him, but his soul was illumined
by the light of heaven. The prelates
made the profession each in the
liturgical language of his rite. Most,
of course, in Latin, some in Greek,
and Syriac, and Chaldean, and Arabic,
and Armenian, and Copt, and
Slavonic. In the true church, around
the centre of unity, there may be
many languages, there is but one
faith. Under the banner of error,
even if the language be but one,
there are many religions.</p>

<p>This solemn ceremony lasted for
two hours and a half. When it was
concluded, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te Deum</i> was intoned,
and chanted in the old and venerable
Gregorian style by the choir, the
bishops, and the assembled thousands,
and with it closed the second public
session of the Vatican Council.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">The Poems of Thomas D'Arcy
McGee.</span> With Introduction and Biographical
Sketch by Mrs. J. Sadlier.
1 vol. 12mo, pp. xii. 612. New York:
D. &amp; J. Sadlier &amp; Co. 1869.</p>

<p>That Mr. McGee was a man of high
intellectual gifts and merit no one can
deny. His <i>History of Ireland</i> proves
this sufficiently, to say nothing of his
other writings in prose. As a statesman,
he was also above the common
order. In respect to his integrity and
disinterestedness, the judgments of his
countrymen are various, and he has
been at different times obnoxious to the
censures of very opposite parties, while
at the same time he has always had
many warm admirers. He was certainly
led astray by revolutionary tendencies
at one period of his career, and
is accused of having, at a later period,
erred in a contrary direction from a desire
to gain political preferment. From
what we know of him through his writings
and the sketch of his life contained
in this volume, we are disposed to think
that he was truly a noble-hearted man,
and always intent on serving the best
interests both of his native and adopted
countries, of his religion, and of his own
Celtic race everywhere. The faults of
his youth he made good by a subsequent
reparation which does him honor, and
we believe that in his later political life
he was governed by sincere convictions,
and never lost sight of the great object
of his youthful devotion. At the time
of his dastardly assassination, which
awoke such a lively and universal sentiment
of sorrow, he was one of the most
valued contributors to this magazine,
and was intending, had his life been
spared, to continue his interesting articles
on topics connected with Ireland.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sadlier's biographical sketch,
introduction, and notes add greatly to
the worth of the volume, and to her
already high reputation as a writer.
Like all her other literary productions,
they are full of the spirit of fervent enthusiasm
for her religion and her race
and of the romantic love of her native
island. The sentiments and opinions
which are interwoven with the sketch
of Mr. McGee's life, in relation to the
welfare of Ireland and the Irish people,
make it also one of the most sensible
and judicious essays on this subject we
have ever met with. It is well worthy
of the frequent and attentive perusal of
every one who has the real interests of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_855" id="Page_855">[855]</a></span>
the Irish people at heart, and increases
the debt of gratitude which all her countrymen
in America owe to the accomplished
authoress.</p>

<p>We have reserved our remarks on the
poetry which fills this goodly volume to
the last. It has its chief interest and
significance from its relation to the
topics of which we have been speaking.
It was one of the instruments through
which Mr. McGee gave voice to his patriotic
sentiments, and sought to kindle
the same in the hearts of his countrymen.
That his themes are in themselves
the fittest possible for the most
stirring poetry, cannot be questioned.
He was endowed with a large share of
genuine poetic gifts, and the great number
of really fine pieces which are contained
in this volume, thrown off in leisure
moments, in haste, and amid all his
other labors, prove that, if he had made
it his chief aim to become a poet, he
would have attained great eminence.
Some of his most perfect pieces are
truly exquisite, as a specimen of which
we may designate the one called "Iona
to Erin," first published in this magazine.
We think the editress might judiciously
have omitted some of the more unfinished
and imperfect pieces, and others
written in the earlier part of his career,
and containing too much of that unhallowed
revolutionary and vengeful fire
which afterward gave place to a more
holy and Christian flame. We hope this
volume of genuine Irish poetry will become
a favorite book with the millions
of exiles from Erin who have made their
home in this new world, and that their
children also will learn from it to love
and venerate both the national and religious
traditions of the country of their
forefathers.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Creation a Recent Work of God.</span>
By the Rector of St. Mary's Church,
New York. New York: Pott &amp;
Amery, Cooper Union. 1870.</p>

<p>This is an attempt to show that the
literal theory of creation in six days is
deducible from the observed facts of
geology. The author occasionally shows
some ingenuity, but on the whole the
work is not one which will command the
respect of scientific men, and its appearance
is rather to be regretted, as tending
to the spread of infidelity, by giving the
impression that religion and science
cannot well be reconciled.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">The Holy Grail, and Other Poems.</span>
By Alfred Tennyson, D.C.L., Poet-Laureate.
Boston: Fields, Osgood
&amp; Co. 1870.</p>

<p>All lovers of "Tennyson's enchanted
reverie" have here another true feast.
The four Idylls, the main portion of the
volume, are fully equal to the first four:
as faultless, as sublime, as instructive.
We do not hesitate to say that the whole
series of these "Idylls of the King," as
the author intends them to be read,
forms a work which, for all that is best
of epic and didactic, is not only unsurpassed,
but unequalled, in the poetry of
the world. Besides its artistic beauty,
which out-Homer's Homer, it is eminently
Catholic. The poet's genius
could not fail to perceive that on Catholic
ground alone is real romance to be
found; and, as the result of deep and
accurate study, his poem is a splendid
proof of the Catholicity of the ancient
British church. He is also the purest
of poets. None appreciates so well, on
the one hand, the dignity of love and
the sanctity of marriage; or, on the
other, the glory of virginity and the blessedness
of divine espousals.</p>

<p>The rest of the volume bears the
stamp of the same master-hand as ever.
We only regret to find so few lyrics.
Of those with which he has deigned to
enrich us, that entitled "The Higher
Pantheism" is especially worthy of
note&mdash;for such, at least, as are capable
of understanding it. Tennyson has the
art of extrinsicating, and shaping in
"closest words," intuitions which all
minds have in common, but mostly
without the power of analyzing them, or
even without the consciousness of their
presence. He uses the word "pantheism"
here in the sense that "God is
all," and not that "all is God." He insists
on the objectivity of truth, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_856" id="Page_856">[856]</a></span>
therefore diametrically opposes the subjective
autotheism of the day.</p>

<p>The influence of the poet is the widest
and most lasting of influences; and
Tennyson's influence for good, especially
on the youth of our times, is, in
our judgment, inestimable. We believe
that his influence is powerful to check
the follies and purify the tone of the age,
and we pray that this volume may not be
his last.</p>

George Hill. Third Edition. Revised
and Enlarged. New York: D.
Appleton &amp; Co. 1870.</p>

<p>This volume contains many pieces
which prove the author a true poet.
There are passages worthy of Moore,
and even of Byron. We regret, however,
that the author should have done
such an injustice to his powers as to
show an habitual carelessness both in
diction and in versification. "The

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Life of J. A. Alexander, D.D.</span> By
H. C. Alexander. New York: Chas.
Scribner &amp; Co. 1870.</p>

<p>This is an extremely well-written, interesting,
and, moreover, genial and entertaining
book, which any one, whether
he be religious or purely worldly, a believer
or an unbeliever in Christianity,
a friend or a foe of Presbyterian
doctrine, must read with pleasure. It
is not an ordinary clerical biography,
but the life of a man who, though belonging
to the clerical order in his own
denomination, was chiefly devoted to
study and teaching, and was one of the
most eminent scholars, as well as eloquent
preachers, this country has produced.
He was also a man of the highest
order of personal attractiveness, of
exquisite taste and culture in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belles-lettres</i>,
poetry, and music, and a humorist
nearly if not quite equal to the choicest
wits of English literature. It is impossible
to read his life without admiring
and loving the man, and esteeming the
great scholar. He was a disciple, friend,
and compeer of the celebrated Hengstenberg,
whose masterly vindication of
the Messianic doctrine of the Old Testament
against Jews and neologists is
so well known. Professor Alexander's
greatest work is a <i>Commentary on Isaias</i>,
written in the same spirit. He was
a powerful opponent of that neological
and rationalistic school which undermines
all religion by denying the divine
authority of its inspired records, and so
far did a great service to the cause of
Christianity. It is impossible not to
see, however, that these great Protestant
scholars, who produce such solid
and valuable works in defence of that
part of their doctrine which is Catholic,
fail altogether in completing their structure.
They stop short at a certain
point, and their genius immediately deserts
them.</p>

<p>Their exposition of the doctrine concerning
the person of the Messias is
admirable; but when they come to explain
the prophecies concerning the
Messianic kingdom, all vanishes into a
vague ideality or a prognostication of
some church of the future equally vain
with the Jewish expectation of a coming
Messias. When we consider the
lives and works of men in many respects
so admirable, and who might
have been bright lights in the church of
God, we grieve more deeply over that
deplorable schism which divides from
us so many who adore our Lord Jesus
Christ and reverence the prophets and
apostles. Dr. Alexander was, of course,
hostile to the Catholic religion, as he
must have been to be an honest Presbyterian;
but there is surprisingly little
in his biography that shocks the religious
sentiment of a Catholic, and it
appears very clearly how unbounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_857" id="Page_857">[857]</a></span>

critical helps to a study of the original
text. The poetical merit of the version
of Ecclesiastes does not appear to us
of the first order. The inevitable shortcoming
of all Protestant exposition of
the Holy Scripture is most patent in the
commentary on the Canticles, the most
difficult and mysterious book in the
sacred canon. It is the divine text-book
of mystical theology, and can be
understood and expounded only by a
man deeply versed in the science of the
saints, such as St. John of the Cross,

the Woman Question</span>, etc. By
Carlos White. Boston: Lee &amp; Shepard.</p>

<p>This book is a novelty in one respect
in our recent American literature. It
is logical. The style is clear, pointed,
and direct; the author grapples manfully
with that arch sophist, John Stuart
Mill, and wresting the dagger of his
logic from his hand, deals him a deadly
blow, like that which Joab gave to Abner
the son of Ner. It adds much to
the value of this book that the author
does not indulge in any satire on women,
but treats them with that respect
which is their due so long as they remain
women, and do not become Amazons.
We are sorry to see him apply the
coarse and libellous epithet "bloody"
to Queen Mary of England. The less
Protestants have to say about bloodshed
in connection with English history the
better; for history is a little better
known than it used to be. Mr. White
believes in the Bible&mdash;almost as great a
novelty now a days as believing in logic.
It is very refreshing to find a man who
writes without cant, and yet asserts
fearlessly Christian principles. Imperfect
as it is, such Christianity as Mr.
White professes is far preferable to the
immoral system which has lately given
such loathsome exhibitions of itself as
to evoke the bitter scorn and mockery
of even the secular press. Mr. White
deserves the thanks of the sensible portion
of the community, and we hope his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_858" id="Page_858">[858]</a></span>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fair Harvard.</span> A Story of American
College Life. New York: G. P.
Putnam &amp; Son. 1869.</p>

<p>This book presents a sufficiently correct
view of American college life. It
is interesting, possesses considerable
literary merit, and contains some happy
sketches of Boston society.</p>

<p>It has, however, one fault in common
with <i>Verdant Green</i>, a book after which
it is evidently modelled to a considerable
extent. It lacks a sufficiently high
tone. Getting up muscle, excessive
drinking, midnight escapades, and immorality,
alluded to more or less openly,
are made to play entirely too prominent
a part in both stories. In <i>Fair Harvard</i>
the brutal foot-ball game (now, we
believe, abolished) is depicted without
condemnation&mdash;except from a young
lady, whose judgment the reader is of
course expected, with the hero of the
story, to disregard&mdash;while the disgraceful
conduct of the students at Worcester
two years ago is narrated as though
it were something very "smart." When
we read such things, we involuntarily
think of what Carlyle, we believe, says
somewhere in his works&mdash;that most
young men at that age when, under the
present system of things, they are at
college, should be <i>under barrels</i>. A
couple of contemptuous allusions, moreover,
to the Irish people, found in this
book, are, we assure the author, to say
the least, in exceedingly bad taste.</p>

<p>We think it our duty to add that we
by no means consider Harvard, or any
other non-Catholic college, a suitable
place for a Catholic young man to pursue
his studies. His morality will there
be endangered; but what is perhaps of
still more importance, his faith will be
put in the greatest peril. This is true
of Harvard College now more than ever
before, since under the new <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i> lectures
are delivered before the students
on all the different systems of philosophy,
by eminent professors of the same;
and in this list Positivism&mdash;in other
words, rank <i>Atheism</i>&mdash;is included. This
is done in order that the young student
may be enabled to choose for himself&mdash;if
he pleases, <i>Atheism</i>! We have
here, however, but a logical sequence
of the doctrine of private judgment, and
we see to what they finally come who
have once rejected the only infallible
criterion of truth.</p>

George P. Upton. Chicago: Western
News Company.</p>

<p>We can safely compliment the author
on many features of his pleasant book,
but not on his selection of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nom de
plume</i>. And this little phrase reminds
us that we are grateful to him for writing
it correctly when he uses it, and for
rising superior to the ordinary newspaper
French of <i>nomme</i> de plume, esprit
<i>du</i> corps, etc. etc. At the same time
we decidedly object to his saying, (p.
104,) "Every thing is so <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">blasé</i>," because
in French the person, and not the thing,
becomes <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">blasé</i>. Of course, it was not
Mr. Upton's fault that the Chicago
printer had no accented <i>é</i> in case. <i>Enthused</i>,
he will permit us to remark,
is a wretched vulgarism, and we have
our doubts about a thing that "would
go a great ways."</p>

<p>Mr. Upton is right in praising Jefferson's
Rip van Winkle. It is a personation
as deserving of praise as the
wretched dramatic version he renders is
of blame. He is also right in saying,
"The St. Elmos who start off as
scoundrels always remain so&mdash;Miss
Evans to the contrary notwithstanding."
The chapters on the "Maiden
Aunt" and the "Tenor" are good, and
fashionable weddings, the fashionable
minister, and petroleum and shoddy, are
well handled. The book has generally
a sound, wholesome tone, is straightforward
in its dealing with sham and
humbug, and possesses withal a dash
of the spirit of the <i>Potiphar Papers</i> and
a flavor of the <i>Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table</i>
that make one feel as if among
old friends.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Sybaris and Other Homes.</span> By
Edward E. Hale. 16mo, pp. 206.
Boston: Fields, Osgood &amp; Co.</p>

<p>The purpose of this little book is to
show how town and city life ought to
be arranged, how far certain experiments
in improved social arrangements
have succeeded, and how the poor are
compelled to live and die in the crowded
tenements of our great metropolises,
such as Boston and other continental
capitals. The solid chunks of wisdom
which Mr. Hale has to impart on these
subjects are conveyed in the pleasant
disguise of short stories&mdash;in the telling
of which he has very few rivals among
American authors. The narrative of
"My Visit to Sybaris" is a peculiarly
happy specimen of his aptitude for that
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vraisemblance</i> which is so important a
part of a good fiction.</p>

<p>Lady Georgiana Fullerton's novels
are most of them productions of considerable
merit. Their great fault has
been too much intensity of passion, a
quality which has been subdued sufficiently
in the present novel to satisfy
our critical judgment, without detracting
from the vividness and warmth of conception
and style so highly appreciated
by the novel-reader. Those who want
an exciting story to read, which is full of
originality, and which abounds both in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_860" id="Page_860">[860]</a></span>
charming descriptions of natural scenery,
and masterly delineations of character,
while it is at the same time safe
and sound enough to satisfy the most
fastidious confessor, will probably be
pleased with this one. Perhaps some of
them will skip the elaborate discussion
of Anglicanism and Catholicity; but
whatever mere story-readers may think,
we must say that they show, more than
any thing else in the book, the great
mental power and accurate knowledge
of the accomplished authoress.</p>

We append the estimate which Hallam himself
forms of the Catholicity of this unfortunate friar:
"Dupin observes that the long list of errors imputed
by Pallavicini, which are chiefly in dates and such
trifling matters, make little or no difference as to the
substance of Sarpi's history; but that its author is
more blamable for a malicious disposition to impute
political motives to the members of the council, and
idle reasonings which they did not employ. Ranke,
who has given this a more minute scrutiny than
Dupin could have done, comes nearly to the same
result. Sarpi is not a fair, but he is, for those times,
a tolerably exact historian.... Much has been disputed
about the religious tenets of Father Paul: it
appears to me quite out of doubt, both by the tenor of
his history, and still more unequivocally, if possible,
by some of his letters that he was entirely hostile to
the church, in the usual sense, as well as to the court
of Rome; sympathizing in affection, and concurring
generally in opinion, with the reformed denomination."
(<i>Lit. of Europe</i>, Part iii. ch. 2, § 3.) "This
confirms the principal points in Pallavicini's main
charge, that Sarpi was hostile to the church, and substituted
his own malicious conjectures for the truth of
history." (See <i>Apparatus</i>, ch. 1.)</p></div>

One of these was the power of giving regular
benefices <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in commendam</i>, that is, conferring the style,
title, rank, and revenues of abbot, or other religious
superior, on some one not a member of the religious
community, who enjoyed the advantages but never
performed the duties of his office. Two evils followed:
1. An ecclesiastical benefice was a mere matter
of political patronage, and liable to be conferred on
unworthy persons. 2. Owing to the absence of the chief
superior, discipline became very relaxed in religious
communities so afflicted. At least one regular congregation,
in France, entirely died out on this account.</p></div>

We take pleasure in laying before our readers, at
this time, the accompanying translation from a recent
number of one of the leading magazines of France.
The eyes of the people of this country, and especially
of our great cities, are being slowly opened to the
necessity of some reform in the methods of judicial
business. The delay and expense of legal proceedings&mdash;above
all, the great uncertainty of their result, is
becoming daily a matter of more and more serious
consideration. In casting about the world for light
upon this vexed and intricate subject, the mind of
the reformer cannot fail to be guided to the mother
and mistress of all nations, in whose bosom is garnered
the experience of twenty-five centuries, and whose
institutions are the development of that wisdom and
sagacity which made pagan Rome the queen of the
world, and has given to Christian Rome a sceptre
whose sway is mightier and more extensive than that
of the sword.
</p>
<p>
We feel confident, therefore, that in presenting this
article on <i>The Roman Congregations</i> to the American
public, and particularly to the legal profession,
we are directing attention to what must, in a greater
or less degree, be the model of all permanent
and reliable civil tribunals. As applicable to the
exigencies which press us most severely at the moment,
we call attention to the following features of
these congregations as worthy of particular investigation:
</p>
<p>
1. The life-tenure of judges and other officials,
with the permanent provision made for their support
in case of disability.
</p>
<p>
2. The reduction of all pleadings to a simple, definite
issue, expressing in untechnical language the
precise points of law or fact which are in controversy.
</p>
<p>
3. The reduction of all testimony to the form of
depositions, thereby securing the sworn evidence
without the mistakes and prejudices almost inseparable
from the oral examination of witnesses in court.
</p>
<p>
4. The reduction of all arguments to writing,
procedure eminently productive of accuracy, brevity,
and completeness; three qualities which, however
desirable, are rarely found in the oral arguments of
counsel.
</p>
<p>
5. The submission of all questions to a body of
trained and practised judges, not so liable to be swayed
by passion, interest, and prejudice as a jury, or
unaided by the counsel and assistance of others,
like a single judge, but bringing to the solution of
every issue a multitude of counsellors, among whom,
if anywhere on earth, is impartiality and wisdom.
</p>
<p>
We commend these features of Roman jurisprudence
to those whose interest and duty lead them to
consider seriously the question of legal reform, remarking
for ourselves that the rapid and accurate enforcement
of legal rights and redress of legal wrongs
is the highest mark of temporal civilization, and that
no country can expect prosperity and renown unless
the judicial ermine is kept free from stain, and unless
all men, rich or poor, have both equal rights and
equal means of protecting them before the law.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.

We use this term in its common, not its legal acceptation.
It technically refers only to those mutual allegations
and denials of the parties which end in the
issue, either of law or fact, upon which the courts are
to decide. Here we employ it to denote the spoken
arguments of counsel.</p></div>

I am sorry to abridge these quotations from the
Abbé Gerbet. They should be read in their connection
in order to comprehend the beautiful development
of his ideas. I wished to make numerous
extracts from this great writer, first, because they
would be the most brilliant part of these pages, and
that they might cause a book too little known, in
spite of its eminent merits, to be more appreciated.
Whoever truly wishes to know Rome, should read
and re-read <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l'Esquisse de Rome Chrétienne</i>. Although
this work was not as fully finished as the celebrated
Bishop of Perpignan intended, he implies to a
certain degree what he does not say, for he possesses
a suggestive talent which is the peculiarity of genius.
He opens to us new perspectives. His broad religious
and philosophic views of Rome direct and
develop the personal views of the reader who attentively
studies the place. Such has been my experience,
and I wish that all instructed Christians who
come to Rome could experience it more fully.</p></div>

We are not a little surprised to see the <i>Rules for
Singers and Composers</i> issued by the cardinal vicar
of Rome, only, as far as we can learn, for Rome itself,
taken by certain English musical authors and publishers
as a positive sanction of figured music, which
has resulted in the recent publication of several masses
both in unison and in parts, named after some
saint. We commend most heartily the well-meant
effort, but augur for them but a very mediocre success.
If figured music is to be permitted at all, it will
be found that neither priest nor organist, singers nor
congregation are going to put up with what is second-rate.
</p>
<p>
We hope the prospectus of the publishers will be
faithfully carried out and the rules of the cardinal vicar
will be strictly adhered to. "The masses," although
baptized with the names of all the saints in
the calendar, will soon disappear from the "holy
courts of Christian song," where, in our humble judgment,
they have ever done more harm than good.</p></div>

The city of New York at this time contained
about 12,000 inhabitants, of which one sixth, in all
probability, were negro slaves. (Preface to second
edition <i>Negro Plot</i>.) The foolish fears and prejudices
of the inhabitants were not a little increased by a silly
letter written to them at this time by the good-intentioned
but visionary founder of the colony of Georgia,
in which he warned them to be on their guard against
Spanish spies and incendiaries, especially priests,
whom he accused of having made a plot to burn the
chief cities in the Northern colonies.</p></div>

Several of the negroes were Catholics. Horsmanden
mentions that they held crucifixes in their
hands and kissed them before they died. This act of
faith and piety on the part of these poor victims of
prejudice of course only served to confirm the enlightened
inhabitants of Manhattan in the conviction
that they had a very narrow escape from being delivered
over body and soul to the pope. It is a curious
circumstance that a law made against Catholic priests
should have been enforced only once, and then resulted
in the death of a Protestant clergyman.</p></div>

Campbell, in his <i>Life and Times of Archbishop
Carroll</i>, has given a clear and able analysis of the trial
and of the evidence, upon which he concludes that
the unfortunate Ury was undoubtedly a priest.
Horsmanden always speaks of him as "Ury the
priest," in his history of the plot. It is my own opinion
that he was a nonjuror.</p></div>

Smith, in his <i>History of New York</i>, vol. ii.
p. 73, says "that Mr. Smith, his father, assisted at
the request of the government on the trial against
Ury, who asserted his innocence to the last. And
when the ferments of the hour had subsided, and an
opinion prevailed that the conspiracy extended no
further than to create alarms for committing thefts
with more ease, the fate of this man was lamented by
some and regretted by many, and the proceedings
against him generally condemned as harsh, if not cruel
and unjust." Ury was the son of a former secretary
of the South Sea Company. He was executed on
an island in the Collect, near where the Halls of Justice
now stand. "Hughson was executed on the
south-east point of H. Rutgers's farm, on the East
River, not ten rods from the south-east corner of
Cherry and Catharine streets."&mdash;<i>Notes on New York

This argument is not conclusive, nor is it at all
necessary. Animals have memory; and there is no
more reason why their waking sensations, emotions,
and acts should not repeat themselves in dreams
than there is in the case of men. The difference between
the soul of man and the soul of the brute is
constituted by the presence of the gift of reason, or
the faculty of knowing necessary and universal truths
in the former, and its absence in the latter.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.

Rom. i. 19, 20; Acts xvii. 28; Colos. ii. 8. These
texts are given according to St. Augustine's rendering.
This gives "a constitutione mundi" instead of "a
creatura mundi," as in the Vulgate. The author, following
St. Augustine, Tertullian, and Cardinal Tolet,
understands St. Paul to say that God has been manifested
to men through his works ever since the world
began.&mdash;<i>Abridged from the note of the author.</i></p></div>

Et sic etiam Aristoteles, lib. 3. Metaphys. improbat
opinionem Platonis de ideis, secundum quod ponebat
eas per se existentes, non in intellectu. In many

on the faith of Aristotle. In support of the allegations

F. Milone, in his Neapolitan edition, adds the
following note: "Throughout this entire passage
we find a mixture of the Platonic and the Augustinian,
(p. 1, qu. 15, a. 3,) where St. Thomas appears
to intend to collect from St. Augustine the true
meaning of Plato, or again to remand to Plato the
admirable design of the ideology of St. Augustine.
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sed contra, ideæ sunt rationes in mente divina existentes,
ut per Augustinum patet; sed omnium quæ cognoscit,
Deus habet proprias rationes; ergo omnium quæ
cognoscit habet ideam. Respondeo dicendum, quod
cum ideæ a Platone ponerentur principia cognitionis
rerum et generationis ipsarum, ad utrumque se habet
idea prout in mente divina ponitur. Et secundum
quod est principium factionis rerum, exemplar dici
potest, et ad practicam cognitionem pertinet; secundum
autem quod principium cognoscitivum est, proprie
dicitur ratio, et potest etiam ad scientiam speculativum
pertinere.</span> There is not, I say, in all our
own Marsilius, a more respectful and favorable comment
upon Plato; but the key is found in that observation
on which the whole thing depends, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ut per Augustinum
patet</i>." Worthy of consideration under
this head are also the articles 3, 4, and 5, under the
79th question.</p></div>

The <cite>Civilta Cattolica</cite>, (series v. vol. viii. 585)
seems to have wished to continue the series of
these opposing arguments of the antagonistic schools,
where, in the name of those whom I call psychologists,
it speaks thus: "To maintain the essential distinction
between the sense and the intellect, it is not
necessary to attribute to the latter the immediate perception
of a divine object, as, to maintain the essential
distinction between the body and the spirit, it is
not necessary to ascribe to the second a divine existence.
It suffices that as the spirit is differentiated
from the body by the immateriality of its essence, so the
intellect should be differentiated from the sense by the
immateriality of its cognoscitive power." If it be so,
the ontologists will respond, that in the above passage
the word <em>sense</em> signifies only that with which we
perceive bodies; so that to sense is given as its term
or object that which is corporeal, and to intellect that
which is spiritual. Now, S. Augustine had at first
adopted the same language; but afterward he recognized
its imperfection, and in his <i>Retractations</i>
(lib. i. cap. 1, 3, 4) declares that the word sense
ought to include also the <em>intimate sense</em> with which
the soul perceives what passes within itself. Then
this has as object that which is spiritual. Therefore
the spirituality of its object cannot any longer serve
to differentiate intellect from sense. (Vid. <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">La Scuola</i>
of F. Milone, p. 32, et seq.)</p></div>

St. Damasus was of Spanish extraction. He was elected pope in the year 366, being then sixty years old.
During the latter years of his life the celebrated St. Jerome acted as his secretary, and mentions him in his epistles
as "an incomparable person and a learned doctor." He is classed by writers with Basil, Athanasius, Ambrose,
and such like men, who have been eminent for their zeal, learning, and holy lives.
</p>
<p>
Through his care many valuable public works were executed. He repaired and beautified the church of St.
Laurence near Pompey's Pillar, and the paintings with which he decorated it were admirable four hundred
years afterward. He also drained some of the impure springs of the Vatican, and repaired and adorned with
epitaphs in verse many of the tombs of the martyrs interred in the Catacombs. A collection of nearly forty of
those epitaphs is still extant, and justifies the praises which St. Jerome bestows on his poetical genius. He is
also known as the author of many longer poems.
</p>
<p>
After a life of humility, benevolence, and purity, he died in the year 384, having filled the papal throne eighteen
years. He was buried in a small oratory near the Ardeatine Way, and his tomb was identified and described
in 1736.
</p>
<p>
A further interest is thrown around this prelate and poet by recent investigations. In 1851, Pope Pius IX.
employed the distinguished Chevalier G. B. de Rossi to prepare a work illustrating the cemeteries which underlie
the vineyards of the Via Appia, on each side of which are some of the most extensive and most important.
M. de Rossi found here in fragments, which he put together, an inscription in honor of Eusebius, the authorship
of which is distinctly ascribed to Damasus&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Damasus Episcopus fecit Eusebio Episcopo et Martyri</i>.
</p>
<p>
The slab of marble on which this was engraved had been used (as was seen by marks on the other side) for
some public monument in honor of the Emperor Caracalla.</p></div>

St. Godric is said to have learned (in a poor school
at Durham) many things of which he was before ignorant,
"by hearing, reading, and <em>chanting</em> them."
In the parochial schools, even from St. Dunstan's
time, children of the lower orders were taught grammar
and <i>church music</i>. Schools of greater or less
pretensions were attached to most parish churches,
and the scholars assembled in the porch. Thus, in
1300, we read of children being taught to <em>sing</em> and
read in the porch of St. Martin's, Norwich. At
Stoke-by-Clare there was, besides the extensive college,
a school in which boys were taught "grammar,
<em>singing</em>, and good manners." To which answer the
pictures in Chaucer of the schools in which children
were taught,

An example has just come under our notice. The
special correspondent of the <cite>London Times</cite>, writing
from Rome on the 8th of December, has a long story
of a mysterious bull prepared to be promulgated on
the 8th, in the grand ceremony, and secretly confided
only to a trusty few. Somehow, within twenty-four
hours of the time appointed, that is, on the 7th of
December, some bishops got wind of it beforehand,
and so great a storm of opposition arose that the bull
was kept back, perhaps suppressed. The writer actually
got sight of a copy, and makes an extract.
This was taking a little too much rope. For the extract
is from this apostolic letter, which was dated
November 27th, was soon after printed, was distributed
on December 2d, to all the bishops then in Rome&mdash;further
copies of which were carefully supplied to
the bishops arriving later; and which is in full force,
regulating the procedure of the council, not only without
a murmur, but to the perfect satisfaction of all the
prelates. A "special correspondent" of the <cite>Times</cite>,
who had retired from business after years of service,
defined the chief qualification of such a correspondent
to be, the ability to write frankly and boldly about
persons and things as if he knew every thing about
them, even though, as was generally the case, he
knew nothing at all. For doing this <em>acceptably</em>, he
would get £600 a year, and travelling expenses paid.</p></div>

This barbarous conduct of the Russian government
has been once equalled and even surpassed.
We allude to the laws by which England, after she
had been enlightened by the Reformation, prohibited
all education among the Irish people. We wish to
call most particular attention to the fact that in both
cases distinctively Catholic nations have struggled
earnestly for the right of instruction which bitterly
anti-Catholic ones have withheld. Yet we are daily
told that Catholicity is the great foe, and anti-Catholicity
the great fosterer of popular education!&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.
